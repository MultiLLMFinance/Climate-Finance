Full text: California's attorney general filed a lawsuit Monday against Exxon Mobil, accusing the oil giant of misleading consumers about the recyclability of plastic products and polluting the state.
Attorney General Rob Bonta alleged Exxon violated California's nuisance laws, as well as laws prohibiting state water pollution, false advertising and unfair competition. He began a probe two years ago into petrochemical companies' role in plastics pollution, subpoenaing Exxon. The state is seeking civil penalties.
Bonta alleged Exxon continues to deceive the public in advertising that claims recycling can fix what he calls the plastics pollution crisis. He said Exxon for decades "falsely promoted" that all plastic is recyclable, and that 92% of plastic waste Exxon processes through its advanced recycling technology doesn't become recycled plastic.
The probe is looking into the actions of other fossil-fuel companies, which haven't been named. Bonta's office said the sum it is seeking could reach into the billions of dollars.
Exxon Mobil spokeswoman Lauren Kight said officials in California are casting blame on others for a recycling system they have known for decades isn't effective. She said the company has processed more than 60 million pounds of plastic waste into raw materials.
"Instead of suing us, they could have worked with us to fix the problem and keep plastic out of landfills," she said. "The first step would be to acknowledge what their counterparts across the U.S. know: advanced recycling works."
Exxon and other oil companies face dozens of lawsuits across the U.S. seeking billions for environmental damages and for allegedly deceiving the public about the impact of climate change. The Rockefeller Family Fund, a charity run by the great-great-granddaughter of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller Sr., is funding or providing other support for over 30 of those cases.
In 2019, Exxon prevailed in one. A state judge found New York's attorney general didn't prove the oil company deceived investors about how climate change would affect its bottom line.
But in a setback for the industry last year, the Supreme Court allowed cases against oil companies to proceed in state courts, a venue seen as less favorable to the companies than federal court. One case against Exxon moving through state court now -- and that may be among the first to see a courtroom -- was filed by Massachusetts in 2019, after a probe that began three years earlier.
Exxon produced an estimated 11.5 million metric tons of single-use plastic in 2021, the most of any company in the world, according to the Minderoo Foundation, an Australian philanthropic group.
In the suit, California says Exxon knew as it boosted output that single-use plastic waste would keep proliferating -- as it has in California's waterways and communities -- even as the company encouraged recycling as a solution. It said up to 3.3 million metric tons of waste turned up across the state from 1990 to 2022.
Fossil-fuel companies and other manufacturers are making sizable investments in advanced recycling, a technology that failed to launch for decades because of poor economics. Exxon plans to fire up a second advanced recycling unit next year at its Baytown, Texas, refining and petrochemical complex. Environmental advocates say it's a public-relations gimmick that isn't likely to succeed. Exxon says it is working to build out enough processing capacity for 1 billion pounds of plastic waste by 2027.
California said that while Exxon "repeatedly suggests" most plastic waste processed by its advanced recycling technology is turned into new plastic, only 8% actually is. Most of the rest is turned into fuel. It pointed to Exxon's statements that 90% of the plastic waste is converted into "raw materials," which can then "be used to make new plastic products."
Five or six decades after recycling emerged in earnest from the environmental movement, plastic waste has proved a stubborn adversary. The Energy Department said in a 2022 report only 5% of U.S. plastic waste gets recycled, in part because of lackluster demand for recycled plastic.
Exxon executives have long defended the company's climate record, and say it plans to invest more than $20 billion on lower-carbon technologies through 2027.
Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported on documents that showed former Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, along with some of the company's board directors and other executives, sought to cast doubt on the severity of the impacts of climate change.

Full text: Climate optimism is fading. Higher costs, pushback from businesses and consumers, and the slow rollout of technology are delaying the transition from fossil fuels.
Renewable energy is growing faster than expected. But surging demand for power is sucking up much of that additional capacity and forcing utilities to burn fossil fuels, including coal, for longer than expected.
With greenhouse-gas emissions continuing at record levels, scientists expect floods and heat waves to get worse. This year is on track to be the hottest on record.
"The pace of our response is obviously totally insufficient," said Sonia Seneviratne, a climate scientist at Swiss university ETH Zurich. On this trajectory, "it will become increasingly impossible to face the changing climate we are going to experience," she said.
The energy transition gained momentum in recent years as prices for renewable energy tumbled. Trillions of dollars in government and private investment flowed into technologies to address greenhouse-gas emissions. Industries such as autos embraced major shifts in their businesses, and companies started to count and disclose their emissions.
That momentum stalled recently when costs soared, consumers balked and businesses fought against new regulations. Politicians stepped back from ambitious climate goals or campaigned against them. A victory by GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump in November's election could make those goals even harder to reach. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrats' presidential nominee, is expected to continue President Biden's climate policies if she wins.
"We have this really difficult moment," said Danny Cullenward, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. "The election is a giant cliff."
The bumps aren't surprising. The energy transition was always going to be a huge, complicated and expensive effort. It has never moved fast enough to minimize the damage of climate change. But positive momentum, spurred in part by the 2022 U.S. climate law, created hope that the shift could accelerate.
This week, businesses, climate activists and government officials are converging on New York for the United Nations General Assembly and related climate events dubbed "Climate Week NYC."
Overshadowing the gathering is a surge in electricity demand. The U.S. power sector had been a bright spot. Emissions have declined as natural gas and renewables supplanted coal. But new data centers and factories are halting progress. A shift to electric vehicles and appliances could lead to a bigger crunch.
"We really are going to need just about every resource that's available if demand growth continues at a rapid pace," said Paul Segal, chief executive of LS Power, which operates natural-gas and renewable projects across the country. Research firm Rhodium Group expects U.S. electricity demand to rise 24% to 29% by 2035, nearly twice the rate it projected a year ago.
LS revived the expansion of a gas plant in Ohio after halting it five years ago when power demand was muted and state subsidies unfavorable. It recently raised nearly $4 billion for its natural-gas portfolio.
New York state's aggressive goal of getting 70% of its electricity from renewables by 2030 has been upended by permit delays, rising costs and the cancellation of several early offshore-wind projects.
"The goals are still worthy, but we have to think about the collateral damage of all of our major decisions," New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said at a recent event.
More than 40% of the world's electricity came from low-carbon sources in 2023, with wind and solar comprising more than 90% of new capacity, according to BloombergNEF. Six years ago, electric vehicles made up 2% of new car sales globally. About 1 in 5 new cars is now electric.
But the gains are uneven. China accounted for more than one-third of all wind and solar output last year and is by far the largest EV market. The spread of EVs has slowed in the U.S. and Europe.
In some sectors, things have gotten worse. Investment in improving the efficiency of buildings -- a major driver of emissions -- fell last year, the International Energy Agency says.
Spending decisions happening now can lock in emissions for decades.
Multibillion-dollar liquefied-natural-gas terminals being built in Texas and Louisiana could serve a projected demand boom in places such as Southeast Asia.
Wind and solar are growing rapidly in that region but are limited by the grid and other factors, said Nitin Apte, CEO of Vena Energy, a renewables developer. "It's like we're running really, really hard, and we're still not running in place," Apte said.
Sticking with fossil fuels risks worsening countries' vulnerability to climate change. The Philippines -- which plans to use more gas and renewables -- is frequently hit by floods and cyclones and suffers the most weather-related losses of any country as a share of gross domestic product, according to reinsurance firm Swiss Re.
A truism about climate policy is that many people and businesses are unwilling to make real sacrifices to address the problem. The Biden administration's climate law focused on carrots, not sticks, for that reason.
The backlash has been harsh in the U.S. and Europe when policies are deemed too aggressive.
In Washington state, a vote to repeal a program that since 2023 has required many companies to buy emissions permits is on the ballot in November. The measure is being pushed by a hedge fund executive who has said the program raises gas prices. The state said it would lose $3.8 billion if the repeal passes.
"We're playing defense on some of the biggest wins that we've ever had," said green-transportation campaigner Kirk Hovenkotter.
Climate policy also has gotten wrapped up in trade politics. China controls swaths of the green-energy and materials supply chains. The U.S. showed it is willing to sacrifice climate action to build its own supply chains when the Biden administration put a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs.
A Trump victory in November would likely squeeze federal climate spending, threatening Biden's agenda. The package of tax credits and other funding announced in 2022's Inflation Reduction Act was a landmark, but some tax-credit rules still aren't completed and money is flowing slower than expected.
Faced with farmers blocking roads and spraying manure, the European Union dropped this year a proposed agricultural-emissions target from its new climate goal and relaxed green regulations in farming subsidies.
Pro-environment parties that helped pass various climate laws suffered losses in recent EU elections.
Many companies are weakening their climate plans. Sustainability fell down CEOs' list of concerns in 2023, behind issues including inflation and artificial intelligence, according to an analysis of survey data by consulting firm Bain.
Ford Motor and General Motors are among the automakers dialing back their plans for new electric models amid flagging demand. Volvo Car recently abandoned a target to sell only fully electric cars by the end of the decade.
Mining giant Glencore was under pressure from shareholders to sell its coal business. They reversed course and encouraged the company to keep the unit, citing waning momentum in sustainable investing.
New green technologies are the best hope for significant progress in reducing emissions, experts said, and cash is pouring into promising startups.
Recent investments include $645 million for Twelve, which makes low-carbon aviation fuel, and a $1.56 billion government loan commitment to an ammonia producer that plans to capture its carbon emissions. Ammonia is a key ingredient in fertilizer and doesn't emit carbon when burned as fuel.
Some startups are facing surging costs. Even when things go smoothly, the pressure is on to make a dent in emissions.
Form Energy, a maker of iron-based batteries that can discharge electricity for days -- a boon for intermittent renewables -- recently opened a factory in West Virginia. It has orders from utilities and plans to expand its manufacturing capacity in the next few years.
"Even that -- which is a massively successful business, assuming we get there -- is a tiny drop in the bucket," Form CEO Mateo Jaramillo said.

Full text: Michael Shellenberger has spent years railing against renewable energy.
A nearly extinct whale helped him build a coalition that has played a part in slowing the rollout of wind turbines up and down the East Coast.
Shellenberger, a self-described environmentalist who turned against renewable energy in favor of nuclear power, claims offshore wind farms will decimate the 360 right whales that remain in the North Atlantic.
Some of the activist groups in his coalition are backed by conservative and libertarian think tanks with close ties to the fossil-fuel industry. Shellenberger argues the whales are killed by the construction of the giant turbines and the noise they generate during installation.
Many scientists don't buy Shellenberger's claims. Most right whale deaths are caused by collisions with boats, including those heading to the region's increasingly busy ports, or when whales become entangled in lines from commercial fishing fleets, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Most right whale injuries are caused by fishing lines, NOAA says.
Wind companies say they are aware of the risk to marine life. They don't operate when whales are nearby or passing through the area on their 1,000-mile migration from off the coast of New England to the southeastern U.S. every winter.
Offshore wind turbines are seen as crucial for the energy transition. Turbines can rise nearly 900 feet above the sea with blades around 350 feet long that generate vast amounts of power.
Projects planned in the U.S. would power four million homes. Booming wind power in Europe has helped offset the reduction in natural gas coming from Russia.
Shellenberger has used the whales to get backing from local politicians, oceanfront homeowners and commercial fishermen. Members of his coalition have used their cash to sue wind companies, delaying the projects and adding to their costs.
Shellenberger, a former public-relations executive, has his roots in the environmental and human-rights movements. In the mid-1990s, he joined a grassroots campaign to save California's last unprotected old-growth redwood forest from commercial logging. He has never stopped touting his credentials as an environmentalist. But he has become a big backer of nuclear power and has embraced increasingly extreme political positions.
Shellenberger's recently established Substack newsletter has become the most popular on the platform. One recent post was titled "The Censorship Industrial Complex," on a phenomenon that he said is driving a global transition to totalitarianism.
Some of Shellenberger's collaborators disavowed him after he began playing down the impact of climate change. "He and I parted ways because I thought a lot of what he was saying wasn't true," said Kerry Emanuel, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor emeritus of atmospheric science, who was briefly on the board of Shellenberger's pronuclear nonprofit, Environmental Progress, now known as Civilization Works.
Shellenberger declined to comment.
Before Shellenberger and the right whale showed up, opponents of wind projects were typically beachfront homeowners and businesses. They were worried that the towers would spoil their views and keep tourists away.
Local groups recruited Shellenberger to organize the fight against a New Jersey wind project, according to event listings and former group members. "The anti-wind community here, it's got to be a single, united front against this monstrosity they want to build up and down the Atlantic coast," Shellenberger said at a 2021 rally in Ocean City, N.J.
He tied renewable-energy projects to environmental destruction and played down the risk of global warming. Then he invoked the right whale. "The one whale species -- the North Atlantic right whale species -- that's really the most threatened species in the world is the one that's most threatened by this wind project," he said.
Later that year, local anti-wind groups began using similar language to promote a link between whale deaths and offshore wind projects, according to a Journal review of archived websites and Facebook groups.
Save Right Whales grew rapidly, publicly boasting nearly two dozen organizations and individuals as part of its network. The coalition isn't a tax-exempt organization, so donations to Save Right Whales are routed through Civilization Works.
In 2022, Civilization Works received $20,000 from the George Mason University-based Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank that received millions in donations from the Charles G. Koch Foundation, according to tax records. Charles Koch and David Koch ran a fossil-fuel empire funding numerous efforts to undermine U.S. clean-energy policies.
Some members of Save Right Whales are supported by other organizations with deep ties to fossil fuels. In its infancy, a New Jersey-based coalition member, Protect Our Coast New Jersey, relied on the Caesar Rodney Institute, a libertarian think tank funded in part by a trade group representing the fossil-fuel industry, to handle donations, according to the group's president.
Fossil-fuel funding makes up a fraction of Caesar Rodney's overall donations, said David Stevenson, a director at the Caesar Rodney Institute and American Coalition for Ocean Protection manager.
---
Noise Theory Is Disputed
A documentary produced last year by Michael Shellenberger showed a colleague cringing in pain while she listened to the sounds of wind-turbine construction on headphones.
"What caused these whales to hit the ships? They become deaf or panic when they hear this noise," said Apostolos Gerasoulis, a onetime member of Save Right Whales and a Rutgers University computer science professor emeritus. He has overlaid the locations of whale deaths on maps of shipping traffic, which he said proves they were caused by wind activity. He focused on the deaths of humpback whales.
Those findings don't show cause and effect, said David Wiley, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration marine ecologist. He is an author of a May 2024 paper published in the journal Conservation Biology that found no link between humpback whale deaths and wind projects.
"I could correlate Nvidia stock with whale deaths, but no one thinks Nvidia is killing whales," Wiley said.

Full text: Tyson Foods, the company that produces about 20% of the meat sold in the U.S., was sued for greenwashing on Wednesday.
Since 2021, the company has claimed it will reach net zero emissions by 2050, and about two years ago, it began touting plans for its "climate-smart" beef. The lawsuit, brought by the advocacy organization Environmental Working Group, alleges that these statements are misleading because Tyson Foods has no real plans to achieve these goals.
"Greenwashing claims are really targeting well-meaning consumers who want to do good with their money, who want to try to take some individual responsibility and purchase foods that are more climate-friendly," said Carrie Apfel, an attorney for Earthjustice, an environmental law firm representing the plaintiff.
"If they're being fed a lot of false or misleading statements, then they really can't make an informed decision about where to spend their money," she said.
A Tyson Foods representative said the company wouldn't comment on the litigation, but added that it "has a long history of sustainable practices that embrace good stewardship of our environmental resources." Beef represents 36% of the company's sales and 65% of its total emissions.
Tyson Foods is the second major meat company to be sued in the U.S. this year for greenwashing. In February, New York Attorney General Letitia James challenged JBS, the Brazilian meat conglomerate, on similar grounds, alleging that the company's pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2040 wasn't backed by a feasible plan. That lawsuit came after Earthjustice successfully challenged JBS's environmental messaging in front of an advertising industry self-regulation group last year.
"We're seeing quite a growth in greenwashing lawsuits around the world," said Michael Gerrard, founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. "Europe and Australia have been the leaders in these suits, and their advertising integrity boards have been issuing a large number of violations. We also see them in the U.S., although at a lower volume."
The complaint against Tyson Foods was filed in Washington, D.C., where a consumer-protection law allows interest groups to sue companies for false advertising on behalf of consumers. Coca-Cola is currently a defendant in a suit filed under the same law alleging the beverage company overstated its recycling goals.
The plaintiffs are hoping the court will issue an injunction forcing Tyson Foods to pull back on its climate messaging or publish an actionable plan to back up its claims.

Full text: Sustainability and other environmental issues are dropping down the list of priorities for chief executives, even as consumer climate concerns are on the rise, according to a new report.
Artificial intelligence, growth, inflation and geopolitical uncertainty are now the top issues for CEOs as they plan their strategies, Bain & Co. said in a report out Monday. At the same time, 60% of consumers are more concerned about climate change than they were two years ago, mainly because of their own personal experiences of extreme weather, the report found.
"When you look at the importance of [environmental, social and corporate-governance efforts], you can clearly see a huge peak in 2021 to 2022 where there was also a lot of action off the back of" the Glasgow COP26 climate conference in 2021, said Torsten Lichtenau, Bain's global carbon transition practice lead. "Now it's dropped back to 2019 levels."
Lichtenau said that many companies set hugely ambitious goals when it came to climate and ESG in past years, and are now becoming more realistic when setting targets, noting how hard and expensive it is to actually decarbonize. "If you look at the journey, you go through the part of where you have huge ambitions setting goals and then you have a drop down, and then back to a more realistic way to drive it," he said.
Many companies have been less vocal about ESG and some have even given different names to such efforts. BlackRock, for example, is calling its tactic for investing in clean energy transition investing. A recent analysis by WSJ Pro found that company boards are mentioning sustainability in their financial reports almost as much as ever, but are talking about it less in earnings calls and marketing materials.
A report from Barclays in August showed that clients have withdrawn a net $45 billion from ESG equity funds since the start of the year, with this year being the first that flows have trended negative.
However, Bain said that customers and business-to-business companies are demanding more when it comes to sustainability, with 36% of the latter saying they would switch suppliers if they didn't meet their sustainability expectations.
The report also highlighted that just over one-third of businesses were missing their Scope 1 and 2 targets -- emissions that relate directly to their own businesses and activities -- while more than half were missing their Scope 3 targets, which relate to supply-chain emissions.
Lichtenau said investors would be unlikely to penalize a company that missed its targets if it was still making attempts to decarbonize and setting more realistic targets.
"People are getting more realistic, but the pressure will increase as we approach 2030 where many companies have set climate goals," he said.
The Bain report also found that Generation Z consumers, usually defined as those born between 1997 and 2012, were more interested in sustainability and willing to pay premiums for goods and services that met with their own beliefs.

Full text: Florian Stummler has been a farmer for more than a decade, rearing, herding and milking cattle on his family farm in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, but extreme weather is making his job tougher by the year.
The dairy industry that he toils in 12 hours a day is itself driving much of the climate change behind the droughts and heavy rainfalls that have slashed his crop output and in turn the food available for his cows.
This has led Stummler to join a project that is trying to reduce the emissions that come from dairy production. He knows that doing so is key to continuing his livelihood in the long term.
"Climate change is already being felt by all farmers in Germany," Stummler said. "This means facing up to extreme-weather periods, such as heavy rain, droughts lasting several months, warm winter months or even frosts in spring."
Dairy is one of the most polluting industries in the world, accounting for just under 5% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. With population growth expected to continue, demand for dairy is only expected to rise with it.
For companies like Mars, which aims to be net zero by 2050, reducing the emissions from its supply chain is crucial to its climate goals. And that is where the food maker's work with farmers like Stummler comes in.
"Dairy is the second biggest contributor to our carbon footprint, so cutting methane inevitably is an important part of our journey," said Amanda Davies, chief research and development, procurement and sustainability officer at Mars.
Methane is one of the key greenhouse gases that scientists focus on when it comes to cutting carbon emissions. In terms of its effect on global warming, it is four times worse than carbon dioxide.
Mars has roughly 200,000 dairy cows according to the company's Climate Roadmap, producing milk for its various products, including M&Ms and Snickers bars.
Each cow produces 95 kilograms of methane a year, according to that document, which means the Mars herd generates 52 metric tons of methane a day.
"The emissions come through the burps of cows, so we're essentially asking 'How do we make less burps?'" Davies said.
In Germany and the Netherlands, Mars is partnering with farming cooperative DMK, of which Stummler is a member, spending $47 million over three years on the emissions-reduction project. The farmers use what DMK refers to as a "menu card" of methods in an effort to bring down the emissions from its dairy production.
The first thing they looked at is what the cows were actually eating, after research showed that it was possible to reduce methane production in the animals' stomachs by adding supplements to their feed. The research in this case involved seaweed from the other side of the world.
"Between 2012 and 2016 a group of scientists in Australia were feeding a variety of seaweeds to livestock to see the impact it would have on methane emissions," said Sam Elsom, founder and chief executive of seaweed farmer Sea Forest. "They discovered this one particular seaweed could virtually eliminate the emissions, but just no one knew how to grow it."
Elsom founded Sea Forest in 2018, having switched from working in fashion. The company, based in Tasmania, farms red seaweed known as Asparagopsis from a coastal site close to where it grows naturally in the sea.
Research on Asparagopsis has found that between 40% and 80% of methane emissions from cows can be cut by adding the seaweed to different forms of their feed. It works by reacting with enzymes within the cow's stomach to stop methane production, instead turning it into longer fatty acid chains that can be absorbed by the cow as energy, almost akin to a digestive aid.
Elsom said the company has created a variety of ways to include the seaweed in cattle feed, including pellets, salt licks and liquid supplements to meet the needs of individual farms. Using the supplements can cut emissions by 10% to 15%, according to DMK.
Outside of food, manure management is another consideration when it comes to lowering emissions, DMK said. The first step in this process is to introduce additives to the manure to help neutralize the methane emissions. DMK estimates that these additives can help to reduce methane emissions by a further 10%.
The manure can then be either spread across the field as a fertilizer or taken to a biogas chamber to be used as a form of renewable energy, which can power the farms themselves.
After this, regenerative forms of agriculture can be deployed: Removing fencing and replanting hedgerows around fields, using no-till plowing techniques and planting cover crops to help keep carbon within the soil.
Stummler said his days have become much more complex. "It takes more steps and time to prepare the mixed ration with various additives, as well as to plan the mating of the cows, which follows different, more detailed breeding objectives. And almost everywhere the documentation effort has increased or even been added to," he said.
DMK said it is also pushing its suppliers to change the way they produce synthetic fertilizers. "The production of nitrogen is very intensive in terms of energy and most of the energy is fossil energy," said Maximilian Blum, senior manager of strategy and climate at DMK. "We also want to use fertilizers that are using green materials because they are a huge share of greenhouse gas emissions of the farm."
Finally comes the role of carbon removals and offsets.
DMK estimates that if all of these methods are used on a farm, carbon emissions of dairy production can be reduced by two-thirds, with the remaining third coming from sequestration, a practice that is becoming increasingly common in the farming industry. It includes techniques like enhanced rock weathering where CO2 is captured in rocks that are ground up and then spread over the soil.
Mars has also said that it expects 20% of its emissions to be addressed through the use of "high quality carbon credits."
Still, for farmers like Stummler, much of these changes require a lot of support. "We cannot initiate such enormous changes on our own," he said. "The risk of making big mistakes and losing a lot of money with some major changes or new types of machinery or innovative fertilizers and feed additives out of a knowledge-lack is very high."
Mars itself is paying higher rates to those producing milk with lower emissions, knowing that without doing so it will be harder for farmers to transition to these new methods and technologies.

Full text: SEOUL -- Dozens of South Korean children sued their government over inadequate policies targeting climate change, arguing their rights to live in a clean environment had been violated. On Thursday, they earned a major legal victory.
South Korea, home to major semiconductor, battery and electric-vehicle makers, has pledged by the end of this decade to reduce carbon emissions by 40% from a 2018 benchmark. Beyond that, the government specified no other targets before reaching net-zero emissions by midcentury.
The country's Constitutional Court ruled that the lack of quantitative checkpoints in the subsequent decades had placed an "excessive burden" on future generations and failed to "effectively guarantee gradual and continuous reductions" through 2050.
The decision recognizes that the right to live in a healthy climate is a fundamental constitutional right -- which obligates the South Korean government to protect it.
As a result, South Korea must revise the relevant climate policies no later than March 2026. After the ruling, the country's Ministry of Environment said it respected the court's ruling and would faithfully implement follow-up measures.
Han Je-ah, 12 years old, was one of the child plaintiffs from four consolidated cases that young climate activists brought before the Constitutional Court. One, referred to as "Baby Climate Litigation," featured dozens of plaintiffs who were under the age of 5 when the case was filed about two years ago. For another, a group of youths held a press conference about their lawsuit dressed in their school uniforms. Han had testified in front of the judges as the trial hit its final stretch in May.
After the Thursday ruling came out, Han wept together with other youths. She said she hopes that the South Korean government, after updating its carbon-emissions target, keeps its promises. "I hope that they will take responsibility for everything," Han said.
Youth advocacy around climate change has supercharged in recent years after Sweden's Greta Thunberg became a global face for the issue. The United Nations in 2021 said it couldn't rule on a complaint filed by young activists, including Thunberg, recommending the claims should be filed via national courts first. In the U.S., climate action represents a key issue for Gen Z voters in November's presidential election.
The South Korean ruling is the first of its kind in Asia mandating stronger climate actions to protect future generations' rights. A similar decision was delivered in Germany in 2021, while Europe's top human-rights court ruled earlier this year that the region's governments have an obligation to protect their citizens against the effects of climate change.
Other challenges are in motion. Montana's top court in July heard appeal arguments for a case won by young people who argued the state wasn't doing enough to combat climate change. In Asia, Japan this month saw its first youth-led climate lawsuit filed against 10 thermal-power companies.
More than 120 countries, including South Korea, the U.S. and the U.K., have set goals to hit net-zero by 2050, according to a recent tally from Decarbonization Channel, which tracks climate-policy data. Not all of those countries' pledges are legally binding.
All governments that are members of the Paris accord must submit their 2035 emission-reduction targets to the U.N. by next year. That means the South Korean government and its National Assembly may have to offer more prescriptive plans to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions earlier than the court's deadline, local climate activists say.
The Constitutional Court didn't articulate what the new emissions targets should be. But South Korean officials now have a legal obligation to rectify the issue, said Youn Se-jong, an attorney and director at Plan 1.5, a nonprofit climate-policy organization based in Seoul. "The new targets will have to be stronger than the previous ones," Youn said.
The court dismissed some other claims from the plaintiffs, including the argument that the government's 40% carbon-emission reduction target by 2030 was unconstitutional.
South Korea is one of the world's largest energy consumers, with major manufacturers such as Samsung, Hyundai and LG. The country earns a "highly insufficient" overall rating -- the second-lowest of five levels -- from Climate Action Tracker, a scientific consortium that evaluates governments' emissions plans.

Full text: Ronald Bailey writing in the August/September issue of Reason:
"Plastics are the new coal," declares Beyond Plastics. . . . The Natural Resources Defense Council says "reducing plastic production is critical to combatting climate change."
Producing plastics from fossil fuels emits a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which contributes to warming the planet. An April study by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimates that in 2019 "global production of primary plastics generated about 2.24 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent," which represents 5.3 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. So switching to plastic alternatives would help slow man-made global warming, right?
Not so fast, says a new study in Environmental Science & Technology, which finds that "replacing plastics with alternatives is worse for greenhouse gas emissions in most cases." The European researchers report that in "15 of the 16 applications a plastic product incurs fewer greenhouse gas emissions than their alternatives."

Full text: COVERT, Mich. -- When Michigan mothballed the Palisades nuclear power plant in 2022, the facility looked like a relic of nuclear power's 1970s heyday. Walls were painted salmon pink and pale green. Control panels had analog dials, manual switches and hundreds of lights that flash green or red to indicate on or off. The valves, levers and ductwork in the turbine room had a steampunk vibe.
Just two years later, the 53-year-old plant's owners are implementing a historic decision to give it another go.
The federal government and the state of Michigan are spending nearly $2 billion to restart the reactor on the shores of Lake Michigan. When it reopens, Palisades will become the first decommissioned nuclear plant anywhere to be put back to work.
Driving the rethink: soaring demand for electricity from AI server farms, and billions on offer in state and federal loans and tax subsidies for nuclear energy in infrastructure and green power investment programs. Data centers alone are projected to account for 8% of U.S. electricity demand by 2030, up from around 3% in 2022, according to an April report by Goldman Sachs.
For years, it's been cheaper to generate electricity with natural gas, and big sections of the public have been uncomfortable with nuclear power, after devastating accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, Chernobyl in Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan.
That feeling has shifted, with a revived understanding of nuclear energy as consistent, green power that could add to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and hydropower.
Stricter state and federal emissions laws have added costs to fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal, and the financial support from Washington and states has helped shift the balance toward nuclear.
Last year, the state of Georgia fired up two brand new reactors at its Vogtle complex, aided in part by up to $12 billion in federal loan guarantees. Earlier this year, Bill Gates, the former head of Microsoft, broke ground on a next-generation nuclear plant in Wyoming.
Utilities have asked regulators to extend the licenses of 14 aging reactors in the past year. Nearly all of the nation's 94 operating reactors have already had their licenses extended once, to 60 years, and two have been extended to 80 years.
While nuclear plants in some countries have temporarily closed for repairs or for economic reasons and then been turned back on, no other reactor has begun the decommissioning process and then been restarted, according to the World Nuclear Association, a nuclear industry trade group in London.
Some say reviving decommissioned plants is a faster and less expensive way to add to energy capacity. Building a new plant could take more than a decade, while the Palisades reopening is targeted for October 2025, around a year and a half after the restart process began. And the process of creating electricity from nuclear energy hasn't fundamentally changed. Palisades' owners believe the plant can reopen and operate for at least another 25 years.
There are 22 nuclear reactors undergoing decommissioning in the U.S., a process that itself can take decades to complete, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A handful of those reactors, such as Three Mile Island's Unit No. 1 -- the undamaged reactor next to the unit that partially melted down in 1979 in America's worst nuclear accident -- might be suitable to reopen, according to industry officials.
In Iowa, NextEra Energy is considering reopening the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant that closed in 2020 when a powerful windstorm damaged parts of the 45-year-old facility, including the cooling towers.
Critics question whether reactors that began operating when leisure suits were all the rage can safely come back on line. Compounding concerns, the company running the Palisades reboot, Florida-based Holtec International, has experience only in decommissioning nuclear reactors.
"Being the first to restart a decommissioned nuclear plant, everybody is looking at us," said Adam Eastridge, a senior operations manager for Holtec. "We don't let that distract us."
Holtec has said that once Palisades reopens, it plans to contract out some operations of the plant to another company with nuclear experience, while retaining ownership of Palisades.
Holtec engineers are now working their way through the plant's systems to make sure corrosion or decay hasn't set in after years of disuse. The Palisades plant, which opened in 1971, used heat energy from the splitting of atoms to turn water into steam, which then spun a turbine that produced up to 800 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 800,000 homes across Michigan and Indiana.
In 2016, Entergy, Palisades' former owner, announced plans to close it, citing high costs. It was one of a dozen nuclear plants that shut down between 2012 and 2021, mainly for economic reasons.
Nuclear requires more workers and security and has higher regulatory costs than other kinds of power plants. The industry seemed to be in a downward spiral -- it was becoming harder to source replacement parts for older nuclear plants, as fewer and fewer were being built around the world.
The U.S. fracking boom also unleashed immense supplies of cheap natural gas that pushed down the cost of operating natural-gas fired plants.
The financial equation has changed as the Biden administration has provided loans and tax subsidies to help keep existing plants running, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, an infrastructure spending law that promotes green energy, among other goals.
At the same time, states and the federal government have issued climate targets to reduce the use of fossil fuels -- particularly coal -- and many companies themselves have pledged to reduce emissions.
In Michigan, lawmakers passed legislation in 2023 requiring the state to generate all of its electricity from wind, solar and other carbon-free sources by 2040.
Holtec purchased Palisades in 2018, before the state and federal incentives became available, for a nominal fee with the intention of tapping into a $592 million federal trust fund earmarked to decommission the plant. The company also owns and is decommissioning Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in New Jersey, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station in Massachusetts and Indian Point Energy Center in New York. Holtec said it doesn't plan to reopen those plants.
A week after taking over Palisades in 2022, Holtec shocked neighbors, workers and the industry by announcing plans to restart the plant.
"It caught the industry by surprise," said Paul Adams, a spokesman for Constellation, the nation's largest nuclear plant operator with 21 reactors, including the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island. "It's like, wow, nobody's ever done that before, and it has sparked a lot of conversation."
"The energy landscape significantly changed since the plant's early shutdown was first announced," Holtec spokesman Nick Culp said. "There is a shared recognition that if we want to be serious about climate and keeping the lights on, nuclear is an essential part of the equation."
While many of the operating nuclear plants around the country were built in the same era as Palisades and have similar construction, critics say a newly built plant would have important upgrades.
"If today somebody invented a machine that looked like a second generation nuclear reactor, it would not get a license," said Mycle Schneider, an independent nuclear consultant based in Paris. "Safety standards have evolved enormously."
Reactor builders today would need to demonstrate that the design can deal with threats that have arisen in the past six or seven decades. That includes installing a "core catcher" device to prevent melted fuel from penetrating the reactor floor, which is what happened in the Fukushima disaster; hardening the plant to the effects of climate change, such as sea level rise, extreme rainfall events and floods; and dealing with external threats such as drone and cyberattacks, Schneider said.
NRC spokesman Scott Burnell said all licensed nuclear plants in the U.S. have been hardened against reactor meltdowns, extreme flooding and other weather events, and cyber or drone attacks, including Palisades. "Every U.S. plant currently operating must satisfy the NRC that it can defend itself against a wide range of physical and cyberattacks," Burnell said. "Palisades met those requirements while it was operating and would have to continue to show it meets those requirements if it were authorized to resume operations."
Holtec is still working through licensing questions that will determine its opening date and how long it can operate.
A few hundred yards south of the nuclear complex is a neighborhood of summer cottages called the Palisades Park Country Club, founded in 1905 as a refuge for city residents on the shore of Lake Michigan. Karen Davis remembers watching Palisades construction in the late 1960s. She retired here with her husband after Entergy said it was going to close Palisades. When the plant finally did close in 2022, Davis and her husband, Bruce, said they felt they could breathe easy. "I was relieved," Davis said. "But Holtec had a sign up a week later, and that's when I got a little suspicious."
Davis worries about the prospect of radiation leaks, and more nuclear waste being stored nearby for generations to come. She and a group of 154 local residents have signed a petition asking the NRC to develop new rules before granting Holtec a restart license.
Among the skeptics is Alan Blind, an industry veteran who supports nuclear power but says a plant as old as Palisades can't be brought up to current safety and design standards and shouldn't reopen. Blind spent 40 years managing nuclear plants in New York, Michigan and Ontario before retiring, and was Palisades' director of engineering from 2006 to 2013 under Entergy.
Holtec said it is hiring former Palisades employees as well as workers with experience at other nuclear plants. "The plant must adhere to all federal regulatory requirements prior to its return to service. Pending regulatory review and approval to reauthorize power operations, Palisades will be subject to the same federal oversight requirements that all other U.S. commercial nuclear power plants are subject to," Culp, the Holtec spokesman, wrote in an email to the Journal.
NRC Chairman Christopher Hanson told a congressional committee in July that the agency expects to make a decision about approving the Palisades restart by May 2025.
When Palisades announced it was closing and many workers either retired or moved away, local officials faced a $1.6 million drop in tax revenue, according to Daywi Cook, township supervisor of Covert, Mich., the town nearest to the plant.
In 2022, the workforce shrank to about 150 people, many of whom were scheduled to do the planned demolition work as part of decommissioning. Now, Palisades has 460 workers, and Holtec expects to have at least 600 full-time workers once the plant opens.
Cook said the town is now planning for a boom in employment, housing and the small businesses that serve the workers. She said the improved finances have given new life to municipal projects that had been planned for years.

Full text: In "Industry," having a good soul is a bad investment.
HBO's cult hit returned this month against a new backdrop, using the realm of ethical investing as the canvas on which to paint the moral lapses, take-no-prisoners competitiveness and unrivaled cynicism of the bankers and traders in the show's fictional world.
No financial incentives exist for them to put the interests of others above their own. Examples of characters getting rewarded for altruism "are few and far between," says series co-creator Mickey Down.
Kit Harington anchors the season as Sir Henry Muck, the aristocratic founder of a green energy company called Lumi. The Dickensian-named Muck, played by the "Game of Thrones" star, is a well-meaning rich boy who treats his eco startup as something between a crusade and a hobby. Muck betrays his own company to sell off his personal stake shortly after the IPO, saving himself but setting up the company's investors and customers for pain. "Most companies fail," he tells himself, wrapped in a spa robe while justifying his mistakes in the mirror.
"Industry" follows the lives of strivers who meet at the London investment bank Pierpoint & Co. in their search for power and wealth. In this series, money becomes whatever the characters need it to be -- a substitute for love, a bulwark against old age, a shortcut to a sense of self, an addictive game.
In Sunday's episode, Pierpoint bankers scramble to sell their virtuousness at a climate conference in Switzerland. "Poster children of a new kind of capitalism," says manager Eric (Ken Leung), whose stint at the gathering includes failing to pay a sex worker $20,000 and lying to investors about Lumi's prospects.
The plot develops beyond Pierpoint. At the climate conference, Harper (Myha'la) and Petra (Sarah Goldberg, the "Barry" star who is new to the cast), undercut the self-centered head of an ethical investment fund to build their own fund that Petra says will be "dressed in whatever politics you want." They land the huge investor Otto Mostyn (Roger Barclay), who doesn't worry about Venice sinking because of climate change because he'll be dead by then anyway.
"Two women who flew into a climate conference and left with a sin stock fund," Petra announces in triumph, preparing the story they'll sell to investors. Otto then turns to Harper and praises her "progressive" look. "New look, same great taste," Harper replies, to his giant guffaw.
As it has in the past two seasons, "Industry" finds fodder in the real-life pressures in the banking world.
"There's an up-or-out mentality to some of these high finance jobs where only the strong survive and the weak are sacrificed," says David Zaring, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "I get where regulators think people just aren't going to comply with the rules if their bonus, their ability to stay in their job, depends on them cutting every corner they possibly can, and high finance has that reputation."
After being on the outs at the start of the season, Harper's ambitions are on full display once again. "All the characters in this show understand on a level, whether or not they admit they do or even are conscious of it, that everyone and everything in finance is collateral," says Myha'la, adding of Harper: "Maybe she's just more honest about it."
Nigel Nicholson, emeritus professor of organizational behavior at London Business School, says financial companies are faced with a challenge: They must search for staff who aren't so uptight that they won't take risks but not so driven that they're willing to cheat or delude themselves into thinking they can control markets.
"You're not going to employ social workers," he says. "But you don't want Machiavellians." The characters in "Industry" tend to favor the latter.
As cracks form on their exteriors, they patch themselves up as best they can, using bluster to cover any glimpse of vulnerability. So far, Robert (Harry Lawtey) shows the most potential for allowing his soul to guide him. When he cries on the trading floor in the season three premiere -- not explaining to his co-workers that the client he was sleeping with just died -- his boss Eric takes him aside and makes him chant the phrase, "I am a man, and I'm relentless." Robert screams it until his voice is raw.
"Now," says Eric. "Go to work."

Full text: Umair Irfan writing for Vox.com, Aug. 26:
There's another reason why [Kamala] Harris isn't emphasizing climate change in the campaign: The topic is spurring fewer voters than before, and for those who are motivated by it, the choice is clear. "Very few voters say this issue is determinative to their presidential vote this year," Patrick Murray, who leads the Polling Institute at Monmouth University, wrote in an email. "Among this small group, they have a clear choice in the race even if the issue isn't being discussed. Their position seems to be that Democrats have to win this election first and then we'll push the issue."
Since the last presidential election, climate change has dropped as a priority for voters in general and Democrats in particular. "We've seen a big dip in concerns about climate change since 2020," Murray said.
Most Americans do think that climate change is a real concern, but the urgency around it has declined. According to a poll conducted in April, Monmouth University found that 46 percent of Americans thought of climate change as a "very serious" issue, down from 56 percent in 2021.

Full text: Exxon Mobil says humans will use roughly as much crude oil in 2050 as they do today and that the world isn't on pace to make dramatic emissions reductions needed to stem climate change.
In its annual energy outlook, the Houston-based fossil-fuels producer said it expects carbon emissions to drop for the first time in 2030. But the world will need policy changes, breakthroughs in technology and market solutions if governments want to keep global temperatures on pace to meet the goals of the Paris climate accords set out in 2015.
The company said it believes oil and natural gas will continue to top the world's energy sources a quarter-century from now, even as renewable energy grows and coal use falls sharply. But Exxon says passenger cars will consume less fossil fuel and chemical plants will use more oil.
The company expects the world's natural-gas demand to rise 21% by 2050, and oil 2%, with most of that growth in industrial sectors to fuel manufacturing and as chemical feedstock. Meanwhile, it sees consumption of biofuels, solar and wind rising exponentially and coal dropping off 39%.
Last year, Exxon said the global effort to curtail greenhouse-gas emissions isn't on track to keep the planet's temperature from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius by 2050.
Exxon faces dozens of lawsuits across the U.S. accusing it of climate-change deception.

Full text: In its latest worker-friendly move, Starbucks is giving one employee a new perk. Its new CEO "will not be required to relocate" to Seattle before he takes over on Sept. 9. Instead, he'll commute from Newport Beach, Calif., on the company jet. We leave it to the Starbucks board and shareholders to decide whether Brian Niccol merits the expense, but the decision belies the company's claim to responsible corporate governance.
Starbucks touts its "decades-long commitment to find solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change." It has reconfigured its supply chain to reduce its carbon footprint and aims to halve emissions by 2030. It also joined the "Transform to Net Zero" initiative as a founding member and committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. "Our vision for the future is to become resource positive -- giving back more than we take from the planet," its webpage asserts. "And we know we can't do it alone. It takes all of us."
Except Mr. Niccol. Conservative estimates indicate that his commute will release nearly nine tons of carbon dioxide each round trip. That's roughly the annual energy-consumption footprint of the typical American household. We'd like to see him explain to California's dairy farmers (where the latte for the latte comes from) why they should have to install cumbersome and costly "anaerobic digesters" to manage emissions from cow manure while the new Starbucks CEO jets up and down the West Coast to keep his Newport Beach lifestyle.
But the Starbucks ESG -- environmental, social and governance -- team need not worry thanks to the system that governs much of what goes on in the name of fighting climate change. For workers, farmers, small-business owners and consumers, "decarbonizing" means being forced to change: buy the electric vehicle, junk the gas stove and eat the bugs. For Starbucks and many of its ESG-loving peers, however, all they need do is buy "carbon credits" to boost their ESG ratings.
Glossy press releases from companies trumpet the "transition" to "net zero" and "a strong and sustainable economy" without acknowledging any trade-offs. It's a 21st-century version of buying indulgences. Well-heeled carbon emitters draw on the "treasury of merit" stored up by those performing actual, or supposed, works of supererogation by sequestering carbon. In words often attributed to Johann Tetzel, "As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs," apparently aboard a private jet.
Nobody's fooled by the posturing. And that may be the point: It isn't hypocrisy; it's hierarchy. Major companies cut checks while ordinary folks pay the price.
Mr. Niccol says he's "energized by the tremendous potential to drive growth" at Starbucks, while "staying true" to its "mission and values." He could demonstrate how true he intends to stay to those values and do right by his climate-conscious customers. Perhaps he can offset his carbon footprint by skipping the latte. Or ditch the jet and move to Seattle as he would expect his employees to do. But what's the point when Starbucks can buy its way to virtue?

Full text: An evaluation of more than 1,500 climate policies in 41 countries found that only 63 actually worked to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Subsidies and regulations -- policy types often favored by governments -- rarely worked to reduce emissions, the study found, unless they were combined with price-based strategies aimed at changing consumer and corporate behavior.
"The commonality in those successful cases is where we see subsidies and regulations being combined with price-based policy instruments," said Nicolas Koch, senior researcher at the Berlin-based Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change and an author of the study. "This means carbon pricing, and it could be energy taxes, it could be vehicle taxes."
The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, used an AI algorithm to sift through a database of environmental prescriptions compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based economic agency, between 1998 and 2020. These policies ranged from energy-efficient standards for household appliances to a carbon tax on fossil fuels like oil and gas.
The fraction of policies that worked combined financial incentives, regulations and taxes, according to the study.
The authors evaluated policies adopted by each nation's electricity, transportation, building and industrial sectors. They programmed the algorithm to cross-reference each policy with subsequent changes in greenhouse gas emissions from each country.
Climate experts said the study is a good road map for which policies work and can be updated to include data from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which is doling out an estimated $428 billion in subsidies, incentives and tax credits for climate-related projects.
"This study gives me confidence that we know what to do and how to do it," said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, a New York-based carbon management firm, who wasn't involved in the study.
In 2015, more than 190 nations signed the Paris agreement, pledging to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels to avoid the worst effects of climate change. As part of the treaty, nations are required to document how they will achieve emissions reductions.
By searching through the OECD database, which identifies 46 types of policy interventions, the study's authors found government policymakers prefer subsidies and regulations, according to Koch.
"We see a lot of policy packages built around these two policy types, and we find that it's very rare that they really work in reducing emissions," Koch said.
The study found the nations' overall climate emissions will exceed the Paris target by 23 billion metric tons of CO2 by 2030.
The 63 successful policy interventions in total reduced emissions between 0.6 billion and 1.8 billion metric tons of CO2. The most successful of the policies included a mix of policy tools to change consumer and corporate behavior.
In the U.S., emissions from vehicles dropped 8% from 2008 to 2010 after new mileage rules were put into effect in 2007 along with a tax break for motorists who bought cleaner cars in 2006, Koch said.
In the U.K., a combination of an announced phaseout of coal plants, a minimum price for electricity and stricter air-pollution standards led to a 44% cut in emissions in the electricity sector between 2013 and 2020.
In China, emissions fell 20% in 2016 from the industrial sector in seven provinces that started an emissions trading program in 2013 that ratcheted down the use of fossil fuels, combined with the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies.
In isolation, policies such as labeling appliances or cars as energy efficient, imposing speed limits or imposing new vehicle taxes weren't sufficient to bend the emissions curve, the study found.
One limitation of the study is that it only examined policies that had an impact within approximately two years of implementation. However, some policy changes take longer to make a difference, according to Christoph Bertram, associate research professor at the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, who wasn't part of the study. Within the framework of the study, those kinds of policies wouldn't appear to have reduced emissions.
Bertram pointed out the slow transition from coal to natural gas in U.S. power plants that began in 2007 and resulted in a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2022. This transition didn't result in a sharp reduction in emissions, and therefore wasn't picked up as a success in the study, he said.

Full text: Many founders and venture capitalists who want the next president to extend current climate initiatives are banding together to form Climate for Kamala in support of Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign.
Legislation passed during the Biden administration, especially the Inflation Reduction Act, has benefited many climate-focused venture-backed startups, and government support has become more important as capital-intense climate-tech startups struggle in a high-interest-rate environment and amid political uncertainty. Many climate-tech startups have started running out of money.
Venture investors are hoping a potential Harris administration would continue implementing the IRA, as well as other legislation that has provided benefits for climate tech, such as the Chips and Science Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill.
"We are not there asking for new handouts. We want to see consistency and execution on what is already in motion," said Abe Yokell, co-founder and managing partner at Congruent Ventures.
Both presidential candidates have been jostling for allegiances in Silicon Valley. For instance, entrepreneur Elon Musk has thrown his weight behind former President Donald Trump's re-election bid.
Meanwhile, Climate for Kamala has received $2.5 million in commitments toward a planned fundraiser to be held in New York concurrently with Climate Week NYC, a series of events organized by the nonprofit Climate Group in September, according to Shomik Dutta, co-founder and managing partner at venture firm Overture. Dutta, a former aide to President Barack Obama, expects that at least $5 million will be raised for the Harris campaign during the fundraiser, which isn't connected to Climate Group.
More than 60 people committed to raise or donate $25,000 or more, Dutta said.
Climate tech investing has grown in recent years and encompasses segments of the economy that are seeking to become more energy efficient and decrease carbon emissions, including agriculture, energy and mobility.
Some 289 climate-focused U.S. venture funds raised $46.6 billion between 2021 and the first quarter of 2024, versus 170 funds collecting $23.7 billion in the years 2017 through 2020, according to estimates by Silicon Valley Bank.
"There are large pools of capital that are interested in mitigating climate change, and making a reasonable investment return," Yokell said.
Yet the segment has entered a difficult period.
Investments into carbon and emissions technology startups, for example, dropped to $5.6 billion via 545 deals globally in the first half of 2024, from $19.3 billion via 1,160 deals in all of last year, according to a report from research firm PitchBook Data.
Investors hope government support would help startups gain their legs.
Some prominent Silicon Valley names have sided with the Trump candidacy, believing a Republican White House would better serve the greater innovation economy.
During a discussion last week between Musk and Trump on X, Musk questioned the severity of what many in the climate-tech industry believe is a climate crisis.
Other Trump supporters among venture investors include Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose firm Andreessen Horowitz has made climate-tech investments. Andreessen and Horowitz attributed their support to a general "antistartup bias" in the current government, calling out regulatory actions that block startups from being acquired and proposals that would tax unrealized capital gains.

Full text: Venture capitalists' appetite for energy and artificial-intelligence investments is putting Europe's venture sector on a hot streak.
European governments' focus on energy security amid heightened geopolitical tensions has helped spur a capital rush, investors and analysts say. Coupled with the emergence of Europe-based AI startups, which can be less expensive than their U.S. counterparts, that is also drawing investors.
European startups raised $15.5 billion in the second quarter, up 14% from the first quarter and up 12% from the same quarter of last year, according to Europe-based analytics firm Dealroom.co. The amount invested into North American startups rose 9.6% in the second quarter from the prior quarter, while Asia deal value rose 6.4% over the same period.
Energy was the most-funded sector in Europe in the first half, netting $5.7 billion, while funding raised by AI startups accounted for a record 18% of venture funding in Europe, up from about 11% in 2021, Dealroom.co said. Before last year, energy startups typically raised less capital than fintech, health and enterprise software startups.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine spurred European governments -- historically dependent on Russian fossil fuels -- to develop greater energy security. Support has reached startups in the form of grants and other government-backed investment opportunities.
"It has been a major shift," said Orla Browne, head of insights at Dealroom.co. "The exposure of energy-security issues with the invasion of Ukraine has filtered down to startups."
Large AI deals have also drawn capital to Europe. In May, Wayve, a U.K. developer of autonomous driving software, raised $1 billion from investors including SoftBank Group, chip maker Nvidia and Microsoft. In June, French startup Mistral AI raised $646 million from investors including the venture arm of software giant Salesforce, General Catalyst and Lightspeed Venture Partners.
In Europe, investors say they can scoop up shares of startups for less money compared with the prices that their counterparts in the U.S. command. Meanwhile, Europe's technical universities are supplying promising entrepreneurs, particularly in AI.
"We have hired a world-class team at salaries that cost 30% or less than you would get for a similar team in [Silicon Valley] with the caliber being as good," said Dominic Vergine, chief executive of Monumo in Cambridge, England, which uses AI to make electric motors more efficient.
Europe's climate regulations have also helped attract funding for energy startups, for example the European Commission's Innovation Fund.
Danijel Visevic, co-founder of Berlin-based World Fund, said funding from countries like Germany and France as well as from the European Union helped push more capital into climate startups. "Europe has started to reap the rewards of the fruits it sowed with climate tech R&D," said Visevic. He added that given the long-term effects of climate change, funding in the sector is likely to be stable, both from venture-capital firms and governments, for years to come.
Even so, Europe's venture sector faces some headwinds. In the second quarter, the continent saw $2.2 billion in exits, a third fewer than in the same quarter a year ago and 93% under the second quarter of 2021, a banner year for exits worldwide, according to a report by professional-services firm KPMG. Exits include initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions and are the primary way venture investors cash out of their startup investments.
High interest rates, which typically encourage investors to divert capital away from venture to fixed-income strategies, have also hurt the industry. European startups' second-quarter haul is far below the record $34.6 billion they netted during the same quarter of 2021.
Investors are eager for a turnaround. Last year, Planet First Partners, which has offices in London and Luxembourg, raised a 450 million euro fund, equivalent to $485 million, in part on the thesis that Europe's favorable climate regulations are a financial tailwind for energy startups.
In March, the firm invested in Sunfire, a German startup developing hydrogen energy technology aimed at reducing reliance on fossil-based energy from oil, gas and coal. The investment came as part of a 215 million euro Series E equity funding round and included an additional term loan of up to 100 million euros from the European Investment Bank. Last year, Sunfire received 169 million euros from a European Union initiative that funds projects that address EU-wide challenges.
In July, Index Ventures raised $2.3 billion in new funds -- an $800 million venture fund and a $1.5 billion growth fund. Hannah Seal, an Index partner in London, said she expects roughly half the venture fund to be used to invest in startups based in Europe.

Full text: Efforts to address the cause of climate change have fallen short so far. That is leading to a big push to treat the symptoms.
Government and private money is pouring into plans to control flooding, address extreme heat and shore up infrastructure to withstand more severe weather caused by climate change.
Nearly all the spending on climate change has gone to prevention, including reducing fossil-fuel use and developing technologies to lower carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Those mitigation efforts haven't been enough.
Funds aimed at addressing the effects of climate change recently accounted for about 5% of the roughly $1.3 trillion spent annually on all climate efforts, according to a report from the Global Center on Adaptation and the Climate Policy Initiative, a pair of nonprofits.
"Adaptation has been the unpopular kid at the party for a long time. That is starting to change," said Jay Koh, managing director at the Lightsmith Group, an investment firm with one of the few adaptation funds. Its investments include an environmental consulting firm and an artificial-intelligence startup that focuses on protecting critical utility and energy assets.
For private-sector investors, putting money into adaptation is a bet that mitigation won't fully address climate change or will take longer than expected. The cost of adaptation is immense, particularly if mitigation efforts are delayed. The longer society waits to address climate change, the more it will spend to fend off the impact of hotter, wetter weather, researchers say.
Government money to limit the effects of climate change is going to places such as the low-lying Philadelphia neighborhood of Eastwick, where streets named after the planets have flooded with increasing frequency in recent years.
During big storms, including Tropical Storm Isaias in 2020, nearby Darby Creek and Cobbs Creek overflowed, creating streams of muddy water several feet high that swept up cars and ruined basements.
Brenda Whitfield, a 76-year-old retiree who has lived in Eastwick since the 1970s, said the disruptions have become more frequent. "Every time a heavy rain comes, we have anxiety," said Whitfield, who is part of a community group called Eastwick United CDC that advocates for actions to protect the area from flooding.
When it rains, Whitfield and her grandchildren check the water level of Cobbs Creek and alert their neighbors so they can prepare or evacuate when needed.
Flood insurance now costs Whitfield's family and her neighbors thousands of dollars a year, up from roughly $800 when her family first got it about 30 years ago.
Sea-level rise because of climate change is making flooding more common. To address the situation in Eastwick, the federal government is spending more than $10 million to construct flood barriers several feet high and restore nearby wetlands to help control flooding. The local government plans to install flood gauges, which would allow the city to send alerts to residents.
The Eastwick grants are a sliver of the billions of dollars being awarded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for similar projects such as sewer and drainage upgrades, dam and utility pole reinforcement and coastal restoration efforts.
"If we don't make our coastal communities more resilient, then the people who live in these communities and rely on our coasts for their livelihood will be very severely affected," Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a recent call about funding awards.
The money is part of a slew of climate tax credits, grants and loans mostly funded by the 2021 infrastructure law and 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The Energy Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other offices are racing to award funds and show progress before November's elections. Many analysts expect that a second Donald Trump term would slow climate-spending programs.
It is difficult for investors to put money into adaptation because projects such as flood barriers, tidal gates and raising roads threatened by rising water levels often don't offer attractive returns and are mainly jobs for governments, which have long funded flood-prevention projects.
That is increasing the need for new programs, but many local and state agencies don't have the money for these projects.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently called for more federal support for coastal projects after announcing the start of construction on a $200 million effort to rebuild and raise a portion of the southern tip of Manhattan to protect against rising water levels.
Adaptation efforts are also starting to go beyond grant funding. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recently proposed a rule that would require companies to give workers enough rest and water to manage extreme heat.
Overseas, there are efforts to protect poor people from the cost of weather events. A nonprofit called Climate Resilience for All joined with insurance company Swiss Re and the Self-Employed Women's Association in India to award 50,000 low-income women small payments to compensate them for the cash lost to extreme heat earlier this year.
The women contributed to the insurance products and most of the money came from philanthropists.
"The longer that we delay the transition, the counterbalance to that is the more money has to be spent on adaptation and resilience," said Chris Goolgasian, a portfolio manager at giant asset manager Wellington who manages one of the few other private-sector adaptation portfolios. It holds public companies such as heating, ventilation and air-conditioner equipment makers, engineering firms and water companies.

Full text: Extreme weather is putting power supplies around the U.S. to the test. Energy companies are racing to find answers.
Hurricane Beryl knocked out power for millions in Houston and surrounding areas this month. CenterPoint Energy, the city's main utility, took nearly two weeks to get power completely restored.
This year, floodwaters washed away an electric substation in Minnesota, while central states experienced at least four major tornado and windstorm outbreaks that left hundreds of thousands of customers without power.
Energy companies are working to adapt to record-setting temperatures, floods and windstorms, as climate models forecast the weather will keep getting wilder. But researchers caution that the effects of global warming and current extreme-heat conditions still aren't well understood, making solutions hard to come by.
New York utility Consolidated Edison is trying to stay ahead of weather risks by working with New York state and Columbia University to predict what effect climate change could have on its operations and systems. In mid-July, a heat wave and surge in air-conditioning use caused some of the company's underground power cables to fail in Harlem.
Con Edison's latest climate-risk study, released last year, said all types of severe weather -- from flooding to heat waves -- are expected to increase in intensity or severity. Temperatures are likely to rise faster than it projected four years before, with levels that were expected in 2040 now coming a decade earlier, the study said.
Con Edison's engineers took those predictions and applied them to its electric systems to model its potential increase in equipment-failure rates, which go up as the temperature rises, says Christopher Jones, chief engineer for the company's electric distribution system. To help protect the system, Con Edison is planning to add switches to its underground network that would limit the spread of any failures.
The company is also proposing to counter increased flooding by replacing hundreds of underground transformers and circuit breakers with units that work underwater. It is stringing tough underground electric cables in place of about 100 miles of overhead power lines to reduce damage caused by storms blowing down trees and poles.
"Everything that you're doing has to be built for the future climate," says Nelson Yip, Con Edison's director of climate resilience.
Bad weather is hitting more frequently across the country and costing a lot more now than in previous years, according to the U.S. government.
Over the past five years, the U.S. has seen an average of 20 weather-related disasters a year with a price tag of $1 billion or more, adjusted for inflation, compared with a 43-year average of 8.5, according to data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. There have already been 15 such disasters this year through June.
Severe weather is the No. 1 cause of power outages nationally, and a major factor in grid problems of all kinds.
Researchers say it will get worse. Although the exact effects of climate change on today's weather aren't clear, many scientists say it has made some weather events -- such as heavy precipitation, droughts and heat waves -- more severe and more frequent.
If greenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase at a high rate and global warming progresses, residents of Houston could experience a 72% rise in the number of major power outages toward the end of the century compared with now, according to a recent study by the Electric Power Research Institute and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
"If companies don't adapt to better withstand hurricanes, we will see worsening outages," says Andrea Staid, a researcher at EPRI.
Last year was declared the hottest year since global records began, and many forecasters are saying this year could surpass it.
While heat doesn't tend to knock out power like storms do, it stresses nearly every part of an electric-supply chain. It lowers the performance of everything from gas-fired generators and wind farms (their turbines won't spin as freely) to nuclear plants (their cooling systems won't work as well) to electric wires (they could overheat and sag too much).
Utilities deal with those risks in part by building extra capacity into their systems so they can meet demand at the highest expected temperatures.
Some companies in especially-hot areas such as Arizona are asking vendors to make sure new components can operate at an average daily temperature of as much as 122 degrees Fahrenheit, rather than the current industry standard of around 104, says Andrew Phillips, EPRI's vice president of transmission and distribution infrastructure.
Storms are another big problem because they are expected to increase in severity and frequency. That means utilities, grid operators and power-plant owners will have to spend a lot more on things such as strengthening electric poles, transmission towers and other infrastructure, says Ed Hirs, an energy economist and fellow at the University of Houston.
A lot of Hurricane Beryl's damage to Houston's power lines likely came from trees and shrubs that were hurled by powerful winds; CenterPoint said it had removed more than 18,600 trees as it struggled to restore power. Vegetation causes roughly 30% of power outages in the U.S., estimates Josh Wepman, who advises on energy-industry challenges at Leidos, a defense and technology company.
Figuring out which trees are a threat to power lines and removing them is tough and expensive, he says, particularly because there are so many of them over a large area. Many outages are caused by trees that are outside of the areas where utilities have the right to cut, says Wepman.
Meanwhile, hailstorms have become a big source of damage for solar farms during the past few years, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for insurers. As a result, renewables insurer GCube and others have increased rates and lowered caps on hail claims.
Two years ago, a hailstorm hit the huge Prospero solar farm in West Texas. The plant's solar panels were rocked by gale-force winds and baseball-size hail, with some areas clocking as many as 9,000 strikes.
Prospero suffered more than $30 million in damage and lost about 16% of its power capacity, even though it was using new technology to protect panels from hail.
Now Longroad Energy is building a solar plant near its Prospero project with more advanced and expensive hail protection. The new plant will be one of the first to mount its solar panels on Nextracker racking that can tilt 75 degrees rather than the current 60.
That steeper angle will hopefully limit damage from hailstones even bigger than the ones that hit Prospero, although nobody will know for sure until the next big storm hits, says Michael Alvarez, Longroad's chief operating officer.
"At almost every project, we get some sort of record that has broken -- it's the most rain, the most snowfall, the most whatever," says Donny Gallagher, vice president of engineering at Solv Energy, which built the Prospero project for Longroad.

Full text: As Donald Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination last Thursday, he reminded the megawealthy coterie of oil tycoons backing him why he is their man.
"We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far, we are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy," Trump said during his prime-time address.
The speech was music to the ears of oil billionaires Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer, Jeffery Hildebrand of Hilcorp, and George Bishop of GeoSouthern Energy.
Since March, they, together with their spouses and companies, have contributed at least $9.9 million to Trump-aligned committees and the Republican National Committee, according to Federal Election Commission data.
Those donations make the magnates among some of Trump's biggest donors and represent an increase from past election cycles. Their contributions and those of another oil billionaire, Tim Dunn of CrownRock, topped $16 million since October, compared with the more than $20 million the tycoons donated to fund Trump's 2016 and 2020 bids combined.
Energy policy is shaping up as a key campaign issue. Some of Trump's allies immediately attacked Vice President Kamala Harris's energy record this week as she moved to nail down the Democratic nomination following President Biden's withdrawal from the race. Harris previously backed a ban on fracking as a presidential candidate in 2019, but was also part of a Biden administration that presided over record oil production.
The oil executives are banking on promises from the former president and his allies for an energy agenda that is more stridently pro-fossil fuel than Trump's first administration. Many of Trump's top oil backers are openly skeptical about the effects of climate change, in contrast with the industry's biggest companies, and want to slash regulations and subsidies for green energy.
"President Trump was pro-energy, you know, there's no secret to that," Hamm said in a television interview from the GOP convention.
In May, Hamm, Warren, Hildebrand and Bishop co-hosted a fundraiser for Trump at a lavish hotel in Houston. At a small private meeting afterward with top industry executives and politicians, Trump went through a laundry list of grievances he shared with the group, including subsidies for electric vehicles and permitting delays for natural-gas export projects.
When one chief executive complained about the Federal Trade Commission's monthslong investigation into a recent deal by the executive's company, people familiar with the meeting said Trump asked, "Can you wait five months?"
Dan Eberhart, CEO of oil-field services company Canary, attended the private meeting and said he plans to give $100,000 to help fund Trump's presidential run.
"Trump's energy policies -- less regulation and favoring fossil fuels -- are better for business and the economy," Eberhart said.
The event raised $27 million for the Trump campaign, Eberhart said, and the candidate raised another $14 million at a Dallas dinner the same day. The $41 million haul amounted to one of Trump's most prolific fundraising days this year.
The oil magnates join other billionaires adding to Trump's campaign coffers. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Elon Musk has said privately he plans to commit around $45 million a month to a pro-Trump super political-action committee.
Musk posted a meme on X in response to the article with the caption "Fake Gnus." He later posted that he had created a political-action committee and that "funding to date has been far below that level."
When he was president, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, rolled back Obama-era environmental regulations and approved two controversial oil pipelines. Some of his donors now expect him to follow a more aggressive agenda.
Many of Trump's most active oil-and-gas donors come from smaller or private companies. That gives them more freedom to express support for controversial views on climate change and other energy issues compared with their larger, publicly traded peers.
Bigger companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron avoid taking public positions on U.S. presidential elections, and the oil giants' PACs have donated to both Republicans and Democrats in the past.

Full text: Ahead of a lunch meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House in March, JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon didn't know what to expect.
Dimon wasn't sure of her political agenda when it came to the economy and business. His previous interactions with Harris had been limited, though the pair had a testy back-and-forth nearly a decade earlier while she was California attorney general during the mortgage foreclosure crisis.
He came away from the White House meeting thinking that Harris had been reasonable and open to improving how government and corporations can work together, according to people familiar with the discussion.
Harris's emergence as the likely Democratic nominee since President Biden bowed out of the race has put the focus on the vice president's policy views and governing style. Given her brief time in the Senate and early end to her presidential bid, Dimon and others have said they have known little about her positions. She struggled to craft a consistent campaign message when she ran for president herself, leaving her critics to argue her policy positions are rooted in political expediency.
"There was a little confusion coming out of the 2020 Democratic primary, but I think 3 1/2 years of service in the Biden White House has clarified that," said Matt Bennett of centrist think tank Third Way. "She has been the kind of pragmatic moderate that we saw when she was in California and in the Senate."
If she wins the party's nomination, Harris would be unlikely to dramatically alter the policy positions adopted by the Biden-Harris campaign so close to the election, some of her allies say. She has already been campaigning on the administration's policies, centering her message on abortion rights -- and the democratic freedoms her party says would be under threat if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump wins another term this fall.
A representative for Harris didn't respond to a request for comment.
Unlike Biden, Harris's national profile was built based on her legal experience -- not on major policy proposals or legislative dealmaking. She first caught the attention of Democratic activists and major donors through her aggressive questioning of Trump administration nominees.
Also in contrast with the president, who throughout his long political career aligned himself with the center of the Democratic Party, Harris's views haven't been as clearly defined on ideological lines.
During the 2020 presidential primary that focused heavily on policy specifics with candidates aligning clearly with either the progressive or moderate wing of the party, Harris pitched herself as the bridge between the two, with an endorsement of liberal ideas but plans that were less far-reaching.
On Wall Street, however, she earned a reputation as a progressive firebrand in part because of how she prosecuted big banks for their roles while acting as attorney general of California between 2011 and 2017. She sued banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup as well as major credit ratings firms like Standard & Poor's, and most of the firms settled the litigation and paid the state hundreds of millions of dollars.
Those who have worked with her say Harris puts an emphasis on the impact of policy decisions through the lens of women, children and minority communities. She has been a major supporter of reproductive rights policy throughout her career. She continued to be a leader on abortion rights in the administration after the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade. She has also advocated for policies to address climate change, housing affordability and criminal justice reform.
As a senator, Harris supported Medicare for All, which would shift the healthcare system from private and employer-based insurance to a government-run program. But in 2020, during her run for the White House, she released a more moderate proposal to expand access to Medicare while keeping private insurance intact.
Harris's climate record has arguably been the most liberal part of her policy portfolio. She has backed the Green New Deal and supported banning fracking. As president, Biden did more to address climate change than any of his predecessors, spending $1 trillion in tax credits, grants and loans for clean energy.
As a presidential candidate, Harris proposed a full repeal of the 2017 tax cuts enacted by Trump and congressional Republicans. Biden as a candidate and as president has backed leaving in place the tax cuts for people making under $400,000 and fully paying for those extensions with new taxes on companies and high-income households. During her campaign, she also favored raising estate taxes.
While in the Senate, she proposed an expansive tax credit for lower-income and middle-income workers worth up to $3,000 for individuals and $6,000 for married couples. That idea, worth more than $2 trillion over a decade, would have tilted the tax code to be much more progressive.

Full text: Wildfires are erupting again in western Canada during a suffocating heat wave in the province of Alberta, forcing evacuations and causing one of Canada's largest oil companies to curb production.
The blazes, fueled by the hot and dry weather, are spiraling out of control, even as the country is still reeling from last year when 6,132 fires across Canada burned through more than 45 million acres, an area larger than Florida, and cost the Canadian economy nearly $10 billion.
"These conditions are conducive to extreme fire behavior," said the government of Alberta in an online update Friday, noting it had to pull firefighters out of the forest because of heavy smoke.
As of Tuesday, 25 out-of-control wildfires were burning in the province, including a 200,000-acre blaze that has forced Suncor Energy, one of Canada's largest oil producers, to curb production at an oil field close to the fire and evacuate nonessential workers.
Scientists say climate change will make such extreme events more common, which will put continual pressure on government and industry finances and tax emergency response and healthcare systems.
Last year, the provincial government spent almost $650 million to fight the fires. This year, it added more than $350 million to a contingency fund to deal with natural disasters. More than 6,000 firefighters, support personnel and contractors congregated to control the infernos. Even then, more than 50 fires continued burning through the winter months.
Wildfires have long been a regular part of the natural cycle in Canada's boreal, a vast region of forests and wetlands that cover more than half of the country's land mass.
A cycle of warming temperatures, decreased snowfall in the winters and persistent drought have in recent years turned the region into a tinderbox. In 2023, more than 1,100 fires in Alberta torched 5.4 million acres of land, roughly equal to the state of New Jersey, more than 10 times the average between 2006 and 2022.
The health impacts have lingered. In Fort Chipewyan, a fly-in indigenous settlement 180 miles north of Fort McMurray, wildfires last year got within 5 miles of the hamlet of 852 people. Before the residents were evacuated, they had to contend with the thick smoke that hung over the town.
Several indigenous communities in the area have spent thousands of dollars to install air purifiers and air-conditioning units in the homes of elder residents to help them deal with the smoke.
The impact of the smoke has been widespread. Plumes of smoke from the Canadian fires spread across North America.
According to one study by the Canadian Climate Institute, Canada's most populous province, Ontario, suffered nearly $1 billion in costs over a week in June last year from the wildfires.
Those costs are likely to become a persistent part of the economy as more fires burn, said Ryan Ness, a director at the Canadian Climate Institute, a think tank.
"Canada needs to get ready for a future of fire," he said.

Full text: The chief executive of the world's leading arbiter of corporate climate targets is stepping down from the role following months of controversy over the group's decision to consider carbon offsets as one way companies can meet their climate goals.
In a statement, Science Based Targets initiative CEO Luiz Amaral said he was leaving for personal reasons, adding, "I remain steadfast in my belief in the importance, the impact and the promising future of the SBTi." He will depart at the end of this month.
The nonprofit group was set up to help companies across the globe map out their carbon footprint, and eventually reduce it to net zero. So far, more than 5,000 companies have had their targets validated by the group, with more than 3,000 others pledging to doing so.
As the name suggests, the organization takes an empirically based approach to cutting carbon emissions, regularly taking into account the views of climate experts around the world to inform its approach.
In April, however, the SBTi said it was considering adding carbon offsets as a way companies might address emissions in their supply chain. Offsets can include things such as tree-planting projects or direct-air capture. But many offsets have been criticized, some for being outright ineffective, while others raise questions on whether emissions are actually stopped, for instance, in deforestation-avoidance projects.
Just hours before Amaral announced his exit, more than 80 charities and industry bodies including Greenpeace and Oxfam had called on the SBTi to exclude carbon offsets from its tool kit, saying they mostly don't work nor do they help transfer wealth to the global south. Likewise, companies like H&M in recent weeks have pushed for the SBTi to steer clear of approving carbon offsets.
But much of the backlash to the April announcement came from within the SBTi itself, with employees writing letters to the board and Amaral condemning the decision. Many were also concerned that the internal policy of consulting the group's various boards and committees was ignored.
For now, the SBTi remains in the consultation phase of considering offsets, and is firm in saying no decision has been made.
"When I was appointed as SBTi's first CEO, my objective was to transform the initiative from an informal group into a structured and professional organization that can drive exponential growth in corporate target-setting on a global scale," Amaral said in his statement.
"Our work has gone global with major growth outside Europe and North America -- especially in Asia. To ensure we can sustain this momentum and improve our governance, we have begun the full separation of standard development and target validation services -- which will set SBTi up for the years ahead," he said. "Now it is time for new leadership to take the helm and guide the organization into this promising new phase that can deliver even more impact worldwide."
Susan Jenny Ehr, currently chief legal officer, will step in as interim CEO from the end of July while the SBTi seeks a permanent replacement for Amaral, the group said in a statement.

Full text: It is the blessing that can help determine a climate startup's fate: backing from Bill Gates, one of the biggest investors in efforts to transform the world's energy use.
Since 2015, Breakthrough Energy, the climate-investment firm founded by Gates, has lavished $2.2 billion on more than 160 startups and other initiatives, seeking both returns for investors and emissions reductions. He also has made investments separately outside the firm.
Some of those startups are pursuing relatively straightforward solutions, such as sealants that make heating systems more efficient. Others are working on ideas that might sound far-fetched, such as burying plant waste to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
In an interview, the Microsoft co-founder looked at the road ahead for the young companies he has invested in.
The surest bets, Gates said, are the companies that find ways to make existing systems more efficient. "They are, in a sense, just making a better product," Gates said.
Among the examples he cited was TS Conductor, which makes a power cable that weighs less and carries more electricity than conventional wires. That lets utilities add power to congested grids without building new transmission lines.
As demand for TS Conductor's technology grows rapidly, a company representative said it is deciding where to put a new U.S. manufacturing site with 10 times the capacity of its first one in Southern California.
Another startup Gates cited is Aeroseal, which identifies leaks in heating and cooling systems, then releases sealant-containing mist to plug them. The technology has been used in hundreds of thousands of homes and more than 10,000 commercial buildings, according to the company.
Gates also predicted success for KoBold Metals, a mineral-exploration company that uses artificial intelligence to identify deposits of metals used in batteries, power lines and other gear needed for the energy transition. KoBold said this year it discovered a vast copper deposit in Zambia after conducting drilling tests at the site since 2022.
A big reason many green technologies aren't catching on more quickly is that they cost more than the polluting option.
"The Breakthrough Energy theory is to get to a point where there is no green premium," Gates said.
That isn't the case yet for green hydrogen, which could help decarbonize steelmaking and other industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels. Green hydrogen is made by splitting water using renewable electricity, but still costs far more than hydrogen produced from natural gas.
Electric Hydrogen, a Gates-backed startup that says it has developed a better electrolyzer, which splits water, is among those trying to bring costs down. The company raised $380 million from BP, United Airlines and others last year and opened a factory in Massachusetts this spring.
One area where Gates said the cost gap is narrowing is heat batteries, which convert electricity into heat for industrial processes.
Rondo Energy, backed by Breakthrough, is working with Diageo, the liquor company, at sites in Kentucky and Illinois and this week announced deals in Europe.
It will likely be many years before some technologies can be commercialized, but Gates said his investing approach is "unusually patient."
Since 2008, for example, he has poured more than $1 billion into TerraPower, a company he founded to develop nuclear reactors that are smaller and cheaper than conventional nuclear power plants. TerraPower recently broke ground on its first project in Wyoming, which the company hopes will come online in 2030.
"As long as that looks promising to me, I'll make sure that it's financed," he said.
Those next-generation reactors aren't the biggest long shot in Gates's portfolio. Breakthrough has also backed startups working on nuclear fusion, which could theoretically provide abundant carbon-free power. But even optimists agree that the first fusion power plant is years away.
Gates called it "maybe the hardest thing we work on."
Startups working to remove carbon dioxide from the air are also still in their relatively early stages. Gates said costs will need to fall further for carbon removal to play a major role in curbing climate change.
Delays, setbacks and failures aren't surprising when trying to develop new technologies. One disappointment for Gates came in May with the chapter 11 bankruptcy of Ambri, a developer of liquid-metal batteries.
Ambri is one of many startups trying to develop cheaper or longer-lasting alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles and store wind and solar power for when it is needed on the grid.
An Ambri spokesman said the company is on course to exit bankruptcy next month and will push to license its technology after it didn't secure enough investment for its manufacturing plans. Gates is part of a creditor group that is on course to acquire the company out of bankruptcy.
Gates, who invested through his Gates Frontier firm, said Ambri didn't bring down costs as hoped. He predicted that most startups in that area will struggle to gain traction. "Given the large number of battery companies, the majority of those technologies will be outcompeted," he said.

Full text: A startup is aiming to build a marketplace where companies can shield themselves from the wild price volatility associated with intermittent wind and solar power, along with extreme weather events such as the recent Texas heat waves.
ElectronX has raised a $15 million seed round from investors led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's venture-capital firm, Innovation Endeavors. The startup announced the funding round Wednesday, after it was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Based in Chicago, ElectronX is applying for a license from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to run a futures exchange. If approved, ElectronX would be taking on two large incumbents that already operate electricity futures markets: Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, and Germany's Deutsche Boerse, which offers U.S. electricity futures through its Nodal Exchange unit.
Electricity futures are financial contracts that allow traders to bet on swings in power prices. Businesses such as utilities can also use them to hedge against the risk of price volatility.
ElectronX's planned debut comes as the increasing use of cleaner energy sources has made it harder to forecast energy costs because of the intermittent nature of wind and solar power. Strong winds can send power prices plummeting while wind farms create a glut of electricity. The opposite might happen if the weather shifts. In 2023, a record 23% of U.S. electricity demand was supplied by renewable sources, according to BloombergNEF.
"The grid transition has massively changed the power mix in the U.S., and it's caused a lot of intermittent stability issues," said Sam Tegel, chief executive of ElectronX.
Meanwhile, extreme weather events -- which scientists expect to grow more frequent with climate change -- also are roiling energy markets. A freak winter storm that left millions of Texas residents without electricity in February 2021 cost power companies more than $10 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. On the evening of May 8, wholesale electricity prices in the Dallas area skyrocketed to just under $5,000 per megawatt-hour from about $142 in two hours amid a heat wave and power-plant outages, according to data provider GridStatus.io.
ElectronX's first futures contracts will be tied to electricity prices in Texas, and it will eventually list contracts tied to power prices at locations nationwide, Tegel said.
Unlike its larger rivals, ElectronX plans to offer contracts tied to the hourly price of electricity. The startup says its hourly contracts will allow customers to have a more fine-tuned hedging tool than they can find at ICE or Nodal Exchange, whose electricity futures are generally based on the average price of power over a full day or month.
ElectronX says its target customers include generators of wind and solar power, operators of large-scale batteries, and data centers whose hunger for electricity is expected to grow as artificial-intelligence applications gobble up ever more energy.
The startup aims to serve smaller customers as well as the institutional-size firms that trade on ICE and Nodal Exchange. Unlike the incumbents, ElectronX plans to offer direct access to its market without requiring customers to use brokers, known as futures commission merchants, that hold collateral for traders on traditional futures exchanges.
The direct-access model could make it simpler for ElectronX to bring aboard new customers. But it also means that, at least initially, ElectronX won't be able to offer leveraged trading, in which a trader uses a relatively small amount of money to place a large bet.
ElectronX's launch could still be many months away because of the time needed to win regulatory approval for its exchange and clearinghouse.
The startup was founded in 2022 by Philip Krim, the former CEO of mattress seller Casper Sleep, who has since become a climate-tech investor, and former power trader Evan Caron. Tegel joined as CEO in 2023. A veteran of electronic trading, Tegel previously worked at high-speed trading firm Jump Trading and hedge fund Millennium Management.
Innovation Endeavors said it put up $10 million for ElectronX's funding round. Schmidt's firm specializes in early-stage investments. It has previously placed bets on Uber Technologies and SoFi Technologies, and it describes climate as one of its focus areas.
Schmidt, a founding partner of Innovation Endeavors, was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011, before it was restructured and renamed Alphabet.

Full text: As the world warms, extreme weather is disrupting the production of some of life's great comforts: wine, olive oil, coffee and cocoa.
Heat waves and untimely rain in West Africa have sent cocoa prices to record levels this year, causing chocolate makers to raise prices. Traders are hoarding coffee after a severe drought in Vietnam, the world's second-largest producer, pushing prices of the Robusta variety to a 45-year high. The more-coveted Arabica beans have also recently become costlier.
In Italy, heavy rain caused a surge in grape-devouring mildew -- one of a number of weather events that sank global wine production to its lowest levels since 1961. The price of olive oil has doubled in the past two years as heat and drought have baked groves around the Mediterranean.
Some of these crops are concentrated in one or two regions, which means wonky weather in one part of the world can have a dizzying impact on global prices.
Joe Shaw squeezes lemon juice and drizzles vinegar on his salad, skipping the olive oil now that a half-liter costs $10, about twice the price of a year or two ago.
"It does feel a little apocalyptic," said the 28-year-old, an exhibition assistant for an art gallery in London.
Italian chef Francesco Mazzei, who runs a restaurant at Corinthia Palace, a luxury hotel on the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, says the trick is knowing which dishes can be made with olive-oil alternatives -- like pasta Bolognese, to which he adds richness with pancetta, a type of pork. But for a caprese salad, he said, there is no good Plan B.
"You have to use extra virgin olive oil, you cannot put avocado oil or something like that," Mazzei said.
Around the world, regions famed for delicacies are struggling to adapt. Land suitable for growing coffee, which thrives in cool, higher elevations, will decline in coming decades, scientific studies show.
Just try getting a cup of java from the Indonesian island of Java. Dandy Dharmawan, who buys coffee from farmers in the Southeast Asian country and processes the beans for cafes in Indonesia and abroad, says worsening yields have lifted prices by 50% over the past three years.
"There's going to be a point where coffee prices will keep rising and coffee drinkers will be pushed toward substitute products that are more affordable," Dharmawan said.
In India, coffee grower Nishant Gurjer has been hit by a double whammy. Unusually heavy rains last year split the outer skins of his coffee beans, hurting the flavor of his early-year harvest. Then an overpowering heat wave in April withered new coffee flowers, which he says will lower next year's production by a quarter.
"Events are getting more intense," said Gurjer, whose family has been growing coffee for more than 200 years.
Scientists say climate change makes heat waves more common -- and more acute.
Coffee traders in drought-hit Vietnam are hoarding beans, holding out for even higher prices, said Debbie Wei Mullin, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Copper Cow Coffee, which sells beans from Vietnam to retail chains like Whole Foods, Costco and Target.
"It used to feel like an unlimited supply in Vietnam," Mullin said.
Farmers around the world are trying to adapt by installing irrigation systems and planting new drought-resistant versions of crops. Adaptations can sometimes cause other problems, said Cornelis van Leeuwen, a professor of viticulture at Bordeaux Sciences Agro. Irrigation risks draining aquifers. Less-dense planting gives each vine has more soil to extract water from -- but means fewer grapes.
Other wine regions have it even harder than Bordeaux. That has inspired some winemakers to venture north in search of milder weather. K Felix G Ahrberg worked in wineries in New Zealand, France, South Africa and elsewhere. In 2017, he decided to get "ahead of the game," he said, and return home to Sweden. He now works with grapes grown a couple of hours' drive from Gothenburg in the south of the country.
"It's burning in Bordeaux and hailing in Italy," he said.
Olives, classically Mediterranean, are also beginning a march northward. Agro Rebels, an Austrian research group, is working with farmers who have planted around 5,000 olive trees so far. Austria's climate is beginning to resemble that typical of its neighbors on the other side of the Alps.
Olive trees, like coffee and cocoa trees, take years to reach maturity. Meanwhile, olive oil will be more expensive -- and potentially less tasty. German consumer group Stiftung Warentest said in March its test of 23 olive oils found that the average quality had dropped compared with previous studies.

Full text: New York legislators passed a bill last week that would charge fossil-fuel companies a total of $3 billion a year for 25 years to pay for costs associated with climate change.
The Climate Change Superfund Act is now headed to Gov. Kathy Hochul's desk for her signature. If enacted, New York will become the second U.S. state with a law requiring fossil-fuel companies to bear some of the financial burden of climate change.
Vermont led the charge last month. Similar bills have been introduced in California, Massachusetts and Maryland.
New York Sen. Liz Krueger, a sponsor of the bill, said $3 billion wouldn't cover the full annual cost of adaptation and mitigation. "We're probably spending a lot more than that a year already, and the numbers keep growing when you look at flooding damage, storm damage, rising water tables, fires, pollution, health -- all these things being caused by climate change."
Saudi Aramco, which tops the list of potentially affected companies, could owe New York $644 million a year, according to a memo written by Krueger and her co-sponsor last year. That is about 2% of the company's first-quarter 2024 profits, which totaled $27.27 billion.
Exxon Mobil, Shell, Pemex, BP, Chevron and Peabody Energy could each owe upward of $150 million annually, according to the memo. None of the companies mentioned in this article responded to requests for comment.
A representative for Krueger emphasized that the numbers in the memo are approximate, and state regulators would further analyze which companies are covered and how much they owe.
Scott Lauermann, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil-and-gas companies, said he hopes Gov. Hochul will veto the legislation. "This punitive new fee represents yet another step in a coordinated campaign to undermine America's energy advantage and the economic and national security benefits it provides."
If enacted, the New York law is likely to face legal challenges, as is Vermont's law. Opponents have argued that states don't have the authority to regulate emissions, that companies shouldn't be charged retroactively for emissions that were legal at the time, and that it is unfair to focus solely on fossil-fuel companies and not the power plants and car drivers who used the energy they sold.
Krueger said she assumes it will be years before the state collects any money from the companies, but she was confident the law would hold up in court. "After they lose the lawsuit, we believe they will pay, and we believe that other states will quickly follow in our footsteps," she said.
Heightened interest in Climate Superfund legislation is driven in part by the slow progress of lawsuits brought by states and cities seeking compensation from fossil-fuel companies, said Michael Gerrard, founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. These cases have been ongoing since 2017.
"It's an expression of the urgency [state legislators] feel about the climate crisis, and frustration that better methods haven't happened yet -- that Congress hasn't passed comprehensive legislation, that these lawsuits have dragged on," he said.
Even if lawsuits or Superfund laws survive in court, state-level action is a piecemeal, sometimes uneven means of tying climate funding to corporate activity. Gerrard pointed out that many believe a more straightforward solution is a federal carbon tax, which would have the advantage of motivating companies to reduce emissions in the future rather than punishing them for past damages.
"Would I prefer this all be done at the federal level? Yes," said Krueger. "But the states have learned over the last few years, we can't count on the federal government to do these things for us."
The New York law would apply to about three dozen companies, according to last year's memo. These are corporations whose operations released more than one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions between 2000 and 2018 and that meet a certain threshold for doing business in the state. The plan is to calculate fees in proportion to emissions, and estimates range from $200,000 for the lowest emitter to $644 million for the highest.
The revenue would be used to pay for climate-related infrastructure upgrades such as coastal wetlands restoration or stormwater drainage system projects. It could also go toward installing energy-efficient cooling systems in schools and public housing, according to the bill.

Full text: There is something more important going on in the Welsh city of Wrexham than two Hollywood stars making a feel-good TV show about a little-known soccer team.
At a swampy site just outside of town, Material Evolution is building a factory to make a low-carbon alternative to cement, a big contributor to global emissions. It is facing a tougher climb than the local soccer team's highly publicized effort to get promoted.
Hundreds of young climate companies like Material Evolution are burning through cash and racing to turn new technologies into big businesses. The transition period is called the "valley of death" because so few startups survive it.
The success of at least some of these startups is crucial to the world's efforts to limit climate change. But companies in their early stages are often derailed by blown budgets, engineering failures and any number of unexpected hazards.
"Everybody says there's a playbook," said Liz Gilligan, chief executive of Material Evolution. "There's no playbook." Had she known how hard it would be to develop industrial technology, she would have started a software company, Gilligan jokes.
At stake are tens of billions of investor dollars and technologies aimed at reshaping swaths of the economy, such as cleaner fuels for ships and planes and longer-lasting batteries for electric cars. That is all while executives navigate uncertainty about interest rates, trade policy and government subsidies.
A previous funding boom for clean technology ended badly. After pouring $25 billion into the sector between 2006 and 2011, venture capitalists lost more than half that by 2015 after many startups failed.
More recently, a wave of clean-energy startups that went public during a fundraising peak in 2020 and 2021 collapsed. Electric-vehicle startups Fisker and Lordstown Motors are among those that filed for bankruptcy or are teetering on the edge.
Building any startup is "one long valley of death with occasional breaks," said David Yeh, a climate-technology investor and former adviser in President Obama's White House. For many companies, he said the most treacherous time is building the first factory.
In Wales, Material Evolution plans to produce its cement alternative by processing waste materials from steelmaking at the site of a customer's concrete-products factory.
The process uses a reactor that Gilligan likens to a giant blender. It runs on electricity at low temperatures, slashing the pollution generated when making regular cement by heating limestone with fossil fuels.
Construction has delivered many curveballs for the company's first factory near Wrexham, which became famous when actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought the soccer team in 2020.
There were worries the boggy ground wouldn't support the factory, and that an amphibian -- the great crested newt, known for foiling British building plans -- would delay the project. The lowest moment came early this year, when Material Evolution wasn't sure how to get enough electricity to the site.
"You feel really stupid, because everyone tells you you should have checked," Gilligan said.
In the U.S., another climate startup ran into snarls trying to build one of the country's first projects to make green hydrogen, a potential replacement for fossil fuels in steelmaking and chemical production.
Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh said the biggest headache with the facility in southeast Georgia was installing the freezer-like chiller and liquefier system that is needed to transport and store liquid hydrogen. The system is bigger than a football field and keeps hydrogen at negative 423 degrees Fahrenheit.
Plug Power thought preparation and installation would take a few weeks. It ended up taking five months to ensure the system wouldn't be vulnerable to contamination. The delay escalated pressure on Plug Power, which was burning through cash. "It was much, much more painful than I ever thought it could be," Marsh said.
After repeated delays, production began in January, helping Plug Power secure a $1.66 billion federal loan commitment to build bigger plants. The program is part of the Biden administration's billions of dollars in subsidies for earlier-stage climate technologies.
Winning government support doesn't guarantee success, and meeting the conditions for funds can take years.
Meanwhile, some startups are shifting strategies to survive. Origin Materials, which aims to make plastics and other materials out of plants, went public in 2021 hoping to fund its own factories. But after the pandemic snarled supply chains, construction costs for its first commercial plant in Ontario, Canada, rose more than 10% and the factory's completion was delayed for months before production began last year.
The speed bumps forced Origin to slash 30% of its roughly 200 employees.
Origin has postponed its goal of producing large amounts of plant-based chemicals at its own factories. Instead, it is finding partners that can help it build plants and products that can be mass-produced quickly, such as a recycled-plastic bottle cap. Its shares are down about 90% since its listing.
"It's already difficult building first-of-a-kind plants and plants in general," said John Bissell, Origin's co-CEO. "You layer all of these other global shenanigans on top of everything else, and it just gets really difficult and really expensive."
For Gilligan, the green-cement CEO, risks remain. There is always a chance, for example, that something causes the cement mixture to clog. Still, Gilligan expects the factory in Wales to start up on time and on budget this summer.

Full text: Hope may spring eternal. Gardenias, not so much. Every April when I was growing up in Chicago in the 1970s, my father, an otherwise unsentimental and realistic gardener, would plant a 6-inch-tall gardenia seedling -- a tropical specimen -- at the base of a big old elm tree.
He did this for two reasons. First, he hoped against all reason that the broad tree trunk would provide a windbreak to supplement his efforts. Second, he did it for my mother, who loved gardenias more than any other flower.
The gardenia made it through summer. But Chicago winters are brutally cold. So my father would send one of my three brothers outside with a hair dryer on an extension cord to blow warm air on the gardenia's roots. Despite my brothers' reluctant assistance, the gardenias always died before January.
Twenty years ago, when I moved to a part of northern California where the winters are comparatively balmy, as a sentimentalist I thought I would grow gardenias. They all died even in my foggy, coastal garden. Had I married the kind of husband I could send out with a hair dryer and an extension cord, they might have stood a chance.
"Are you [expletive deleted] kidding me?" he asked the only time I gently suggested it.
But now, two decades later, with annual temperatures hitting record highs, gardenias can thrive in my Bay Area growing zone.
"Years ago we grew gardenias in a greenhouse, and I would wait until they were in full bloom and bring them home where they would drop all their buds and never bloom again," said Janet Sluis, program director of the Sunset Plant Collection, a selection of more than 150 plants sold at West Coast retail nurseries. "With less fog these days, I have a shrub gardenia called 'Jubilation' that actually blooms every year for me in Berkeley."
Air temperatures have increased by at least 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, according to NASA, a change that has accelerated since 1975. Global warming has impacted gardens across the country -- and though this sounds weird to say, for gardeners the effects aren't all bad. With longer growing seasons and warmer winters, it's possible to grow plants that only a generation ago were out of the question.
Edmund Hollander, a landscape architect in New York, cites two examples. First, the southern magnolia tree. "Thirty years ago, if you put it in a backyard on Long Island and protected it with a baby blanket during the winter, you could keep it alive. But now it is as happy as a clam growing there." Second, crepe myrtles, "a Southern staple, now grow very well on Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Long Island."
Other trees -- such as Eastern redbuds and flowering dogwoods, once limited to growing zones no colder than southern Michigan, will now thrive in northern parts of that state, said Dan Herms, vice president of research and development at Davey Tree Expert Company in Kent, Ohio. And bald cypresses, deciduous trees native to the Southeast, can now be planted as far north as Minnesota's Twin Cities.
To keep up with the changes, Herms compiles lists of climate-ready trees for Davey's offices around the country: "We get requests increasingly for trees that will perform as the climate continues to change, sometimes significantly in the lifespan of a tree."
On one hand it's exciting to consider the possibilities -- Sluis says she's growing tomatoes in Berkeley ("Thirty years ago -- no way"), and Herms has planted warmer-climate trees like scarlet oak in his northern Ohio garden ("they've been in the ground four years -- knock on wood," he said). And I am dreaming of a gardenia hedge.
But those same experts -- and others -- warn there's also bad news.
Michael Schmitt, an associate dean who heads the Department of Agricultural and Natural Resource Systems at the University of Minnesota Extension, cautions that unexpected results can arise. "I hope the average gardener is not going to just say, 'Oh great, our change in weather patterns and climate shifts will open opportunities to grow a new plant I couldn't have before.'"
"Who would be so shortsighted?" I asked, hastily deleting an online shopping cart to which I had been adding several "Jubilation Gardenia Plants -- $19.79" while I spoke to him by phone.
"It's the problem of the shiny new object. We want it but fail to see it brings unintended consequences," Schmitt said. "With warmer weather, we get pests we've never seen before, weeds we've never seen before and soil that has fewer nutrients because of leaching."
Also, edible plants that have chill requirements -- such as cold-weather vegetable crops and fruit trees -- might not grow as well in regions where they previously thrived.
"If you live in California and want to grow a peach or cherry or plum tree in your yard, you may need to look for varieties that require fewer chill hours during their winter dormancy or they might not set fruit," said Tapan Pathak, an associate professor at the University of California-Merced Cooperative Extension who developed an online tool called CalAgroClimate to help farmers choose the best crops as the climate warms.
As temperatures have climbed, weather has become more intense: rainy seasons are wetter, storms more severe, droughts longer. Sluis said, "We're seeing drastic swings in weather and temperatures, and although we may be getting warmer in general, one year we will see winter temperatures colder than usual -- Texas got seriously wiped out with snow and ice storms two years ago and lost plants that had been established for 10 to 15 years."
"It's confusing," I said. "What are we gardeners supposed to do?"
"Keep gardening -- gardens are one of the best steps we can take to help slow climate change," Sluis said. "By planting gardens, you put carbon into the soil where you want it to be. By growing flowers, you help pollinators. A garden creates habitats. It's not just you or just me alone gardening. We add up all the gardens, we make a big difference."
Emboldened, I refilled my shopping cart with gardenia plants.
To keep up with changes, ask for advice from your local cooperative extension (most counties have an office of this educational system that the federal government created in 1914). For advice about trees, the U.S. Forest Service publishes a Climate Change Tree Atlas for species that grow in the eastern part of the country. Many cities -- including Philadelphia and San Francisco -- have published lists of trees that will help preserve their urban tree canopies as the climate changes.
And don't forget to ask your neighbor if any new or unusual plants are thriving in her garden. "Word-of-mouth is one of the best ways to keep up," said Sarah Stuckey Coates, a landscape designer in Mill Valley, where I live.
I told her I'll report back to her in a year about the gardenia hedge. If a cold snap hits, I'll man the hair dryer myself.

Full text: SALT LAKE CITY -- Darin Christensen was working on his boat docked in the Great Salt Lake, preparing for something he hadn't been able to do the past two years: take it out in the water.
"You can sail 40 miles without hitting anything," a grinning Christensen, 62, said in April as a ceaseless wind rocked his 25-footer, the Abraxas.
After two decades of drought, the Great Salt Lake in 2022 fell to its lowest level on record, 4,188.5 feet, leaving some marina docks in the mud. About 200 boats, including the Abraxas, were hauled onto dry land. Researchers at Brigham Young University warned in January 2023 that "the lake as we know it" was on track to disappear in five years, putting $2.5 billion of economic activity from skiing to mineral extraction to brine-shrimp fishing at risk.
Then came an unexpected deluge of rain and snow in the winters of 2023 and 2024. The amount of land covered by the Great Salt Lake has since grown about 150 square miles -- an area the size of Denver -- and the overall water level has risen 6 feet.
Similar aquatic comebacks are occurring across the West. The mountain snowpack that feeds the Colorado River, which provides water to 40 million people, is 107% of average this winter after hitting 153% in 2023, marking the wettest two-year period in more than a decade.
Lake Mead, the Colorado River's largest reservoir, has risen 30 feet from a record low. Lake Powell, the second biggest reservoir, has grown by 40 feet.
Last year, the West was hit with an unusually large number of so-called atmospheric rivers, which dump prodigious amounts of rain. In December 2022 and January 2023, California experienced nine back-to-back atmospheric rivers -- the most during such a short period in 70 years of records, according to an analysis by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Then this past winter, heavy rain was driven by an El Nino climate pattern, which scientists say was turbocharged by the overall warming climate.
Water-dependent businesses across the West are celebrating. Visitors to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which includes Lake Powell, doubled last year from 2022 to a record 5.2 million visitors.
"We knew, and prayed, that the lake was going to go back up," said Gregg Martinez, director of economic development for nearby Page, Ariz.
One exception to the trend has been the Pacific Northwest, where rain has been lighter and drought has persisted in places.
Across the West, water researchers caution that due to climate change, they still expect the long-term trend will be more frequent droughts and shrinking snowpacks. They have urged local officials to continue conservation efforts that began during the drought.
"We don't know at all whether this will be a 20-year reprieve or a two-year reprieve," said Bruce Babcock, professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside.
In Utah, lawmakers in 2022 and 2023 passed conservation measures with a total cost of nearly $1 billion that included rebates for replacement of grass and paying farmers to idle crops to save water. Now, state officials are scrambling to capture as much of the unexpected precipitation as they can.
"We need to take advantage of these wet years to get the lake as high as we can," said Tim Davis, Utah's deputy Great Salt Lake commissioner. "These two years have bought us time."
Valjay Rigby, a farmer in Cache County, Utah, said he is getting enough water to restore his alfalfa and other crops to normal production this year, up from 25% of normal in 2022. At the same time, like many local farmers, he is installing more efficient sprinklers and looking at a drip-irrigation system under a new state program that matches farmers' costs.
At the Great Salt Lake, the higher water has enabled marina officials to put 85 boats back in the water, including the Abraxas, after the last ones were taken out in 2021. Another 100 likely will follow suit this summer, the most in four years, said park manager Dave Shearer. That helps the local economy, he said, because boat slips rent for between $125 and $240 a month. Recreation spending at the lake totals about $44.5 million a year.
Also benefiting are businesses that harvest brine shrimp eggs, which are sold overseas as a feed for farmed shrimp and fish in a business that brings in as much as $60 million a year, said Timothy Hawkes, chairman of the Great Salt Lake Brine Shrimp Cooperative.
Shrinking waters in the Great Salt Lake in 2022 caused salinity levels to rise higher than the shrimp are accustomed to, which damaged their eggs. That hurt not only the industry, but millions of migratory birds that feed in the lake. With more water, the salinity has dropped back to a safer level, prompting a revival in the ecosystem.
Hawkes said it was important to get a pair of wet winters, because much of the runoff from melting snow last year went to refilling reservoirs and replenishing dry soil, rather than into the Great Salt Lake.
"Having the two back to back has been an absolute godsend," he said.

Full text: SAN DIEGO -- Generative artificial intelligence, geopolitical tension, punishing climate events -- the list of headaches for businesses' risk managers can seem to be in a perpetual state of growth.
Experts see a deteriorating risk landscape, with most reporting a negative outlook that is expected to worsen during the next decade, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2024.
The problems, though vexing, aren't intractable. About 10,000 risk managers and experts met this week in San Diego for the annual Riskworld conference put on by trade association RIMS to discuss the industry's more pressing issues. Here's what some top experts are advising businesses:
Generative AI
Many businesses, if not committing to generative AI, are at least flirting with it. But in the rush to adopt, they likely are missing some of the less-obvious risks that the technology poses, including models that might push out biased information or be inadvertently built with copyrighted intellectual property.
"AI is dominating the landscape. Where we are right now is the automobile before the seat belt. This is a new dimension that I don't think a lot of our clients have had thought about.
"The questions that are really coming up with our clients right now that we weren't hearing a year ago on this are on truly appreciating the liability associated with AI. Whether that's IP infringement because the training data is from a third party, or whether the training data might be bad and you're making bad decisions off of that."
-- Reid Sawyer, head of U.S. cyber risk consulting for insurance broker and risk adviser Marsh
Geopolitical tension
The combination of China-U.S. friction, the Ukraine-Russia war and conflict in the Middle East has kept multinational businesses on their toes. Persistent attacks in the Red Sea have raised supply-chain worries. Some businesses are finding political risk insurance more difficult to obtain. Insurance policies that cover cyberattacks might not pay if the attack occurs in the context of a war, one expert warned.
"We saw how vulnerable supply chains can be to a shock. That is causing companies to rethink that and to make them more resilient and less dependent on China. Supply chains generally are a topic of discussion that they haven't been for a while.
-- Adrian Cox, chief executive for London-based specialty insurer and reinsurer Beazley
"One of the biggest problems we've had this past year in the cyber insurance community has been the war exclusion. There were several sovereign states that actively promoted hacking, ransomware, all that bad stuff. There is a war exclusion in cyber policies, but that doesn't mean that they're not going to cover the nation-state action."
"But it does add a wrinkle. What's going on in Ukraine, what's going on in the Middle East certainly could ripple back into cyber insurance."
-- Bob Parisi, head of cyber solutions (North America) for German insurer Munich Re
Climate risk
More organizations are beginning to appreciate the risks posed by climate change, and they are working to adapt. Climate scientists have long pushed changes in building and site design as a way to grapple with the physical risks of climate events, a message some experts are taking to businesses. In addition to protecting facilities from loss, resilient businesses can also avoid losing market share during down times.
"We are definitely seeing an uptick in organizations recognizing that climate risks are here to stay and they're becoming more intense. They really want to do what they can to keep their business resilient.
"Organizations are looking to build their sustainability strategies. They're using different construction materials and different construction methods. They realize that they can't insure their way out of some of this risk. There's a physical risk, there's the business continuity risk -- it's also a reputational risk."
-- Jessica Waters, manager of climate and structural resilience at commercial insurer FM Global

Full text: When postal manager Jose Belloso put his Paris apartment up for sale this year, he was required to have an inspector grade the home for energy efficiency under strict rules designed to fight climate change.
Belloso's building was built in the early 1900s from millstone, a porous sedimentary rock that was popular among architects of France's Belle Epoque. His apartment flunked the inspection -- and under a regulation that took effect this year, the property was barred from the rental market until costly renovations were made.
Belloso was forced to knock 50,000 euros, $54,000, off his asking price to find a buyer.
Consumers are starting to pay for the energy transition, and they aren't happy about it.
Governments that were among the earliest in the world to adopt climate legislation tried to take the sting out of the transition by motivating consumers with subsidies. Now, however, the same capitals are cash-strapped and many are passing the bill to the consumer. Subsidies are being scaled back, taxes tied to carbon emissions are being phased in, and rules requiring costly renovations are starting to bite.
Many consumers, including those who broadly support the energy transition, are unwilling to pay up. Farmers have laid siege to European capitals over plans to remove diesel-fuel subsidies. Germans have rebelled against requirements to replace polluting gas boilers.
Governments lined up climate measures years ago when interest rates were low and energy supplies seemed abundant. Now, governments are facing a new calculus. Wars in Ukraine and Gaza are forcing Western countries to spend more on defense while grappling with higher energy costs and inflation.
The challenge lies in designing climate policy with geopolitical shock absorbers. French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Europe might require a "regulatory pause" so its economy can absorb the impact of the Ukraine war, and the European Union recently trimmed some of its climate measures.
Delaying the energy transition by as little as five years, however, could lead to an increase in the average global temperature of three degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, says energy-research firm Wood Mackenzie. That exceeds the landmark Paris accord's threshold of 1.5 degrees.
For now, energy-transition fatigue is setting in, falling "on the shoulders of the low- and mid-income-level people in a disproportionate way," said Fatih Birol, chief of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which is tasked with keeping governments on track to meet their climate targets.
Europe has in many ways embodied the ethos of a transition free of sacrifice. Underpinning that idea was the flow of relatively cheap Russian natural gas, which the Continent planned to wean itself off as it moved to cleaner sources of energy. Billions in subsidies the European Union mobilized to fight the Covid-19 pandemic also could be rerouted to green Europe's economy.
That belief was punctured when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, sending energy prices rocketing, fueling inflation and driving up costs for companies. Germany, the Continent's economic powerhouse, began to sputter as its energy-hungry manufacturers confronted soaring electricity and gas bills. Then Germany's constitutional court ruled that Berlin couldn't tap unused funds left in pandemic-era special-purpose vehicles to fund the transition, forcing the government to cut spending by about 60 billion euros.
Scores of incentives designed to encourage lower carbon emissions were suddenly doomed.
France passed climate legislation in 2021 that, as of this year, began barring homes from the rental market if they scored low on energy-efficiency inspections.
Belloso's apartment wasn't drafty, so he was surprised when the inspector deemed it a "thermal colander," an official designation for apartments that don't retain enough heat. He was docked for having an outdated heating system and windows. What really did him in, however, were the millstone walls.
The only way to insulate his apartment without affecting the building's historic exterior was to add layers of thick insulation to the interior walls. Belloso, who is 61 years old, estimated the total renovation would cost him 25,000 euros. Moreover, the need for thicker walls would cut into the square-footage of his apartment. He decided to sell the apartment at the reduced price of 220,000 euros.
"They raised the bar too high, all at once," Belloso said. "And voila! You plunge everyone into forced sales."

Full text: As the world's biggest elections get under way in India, candidates for national offices will need to beat something more perilous than political rivals -- extreme heat.
The India Meteorological Department has warned that during this year's election, which started earlier this month and runs until early June, most parts of the country will face higher than usual temperatures for the time of year, and potentially twice as many extreme-heat days.
Some 970 million voters and roughly 15 million poll workers will be exposed to temperatures that can reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of the country.
Held in stages, India's elections are by their very nature a feat of endurance. Voters can spend hours listening to local candidates at outdoor rallies or waiting in lines to vote. Election workers crisscross the country by helicopter and boat, hitch rides on elephants, or trek on foot in the Himalayan mountains to ferry the country's 5.5 million voting machines to the far-flung hamlets due to vote next.
Meanwhile, thousands of candidates spend their days blasting campaign messages from open or partly shaded vehicles or sitting on sun-soaked stages waiting to speak.
V. Vaithilingam, a 73-year-old lawmaker from the Congress Party, was waving to supporters from his campaign truck a few weeks ago when he suddenly fainted. He had been on the go since early morning, giving speeches and walking around neighborhoods in Puducherry, a southern coastal town known for hot, sticky weather. His political aides got him back on his feet, and after a 15-minute break and sips of juice, he continued his campaign.
"There is no other option," said Vaithilingam, who said he didn't have a lot of time to campaign -- the territory voted in the first stage. Now that voting there is finished, he can stay out of the sun.
The European Union's climate-monitoring service said that last month was the Earth's hottest March on record, and the 10th straight month of historic heat. Climate change, as well as the periodic weather pattern known as El Nino, have contributed to the warming.
In the longer term, climate experts have warned, historically warm regions such as India will experience more intense and frequent heat waves that, combined with high humidity, will test the limits of human survival. Compounding the risks, the country's large number of poor people lack access to cooling systems or sufficient healthcare facilities.
Last year, dozens of people fell ill and more than 10 died of heatstroke after attending an outdoor government event in the state of Maharashtra.
Kieran M.R. Hunt, a research fellow in the department of meteorology at the U.K.'s University of Reading who studies extreme weather events in South Asia, said holding outdoor events in the hottest months is ill-advised.
"This risk could easily be avoided by holding the elections several months earlier or several months later," he said.
India's first election, in late 1951 and early 1952, lasted some four months, but during the cooler part of the year. Others were quicker affairs. In 1980, voting took place on two days in January. And in 1999, the elections took place in September and October, after the monsoon.
But in 2004, looking to capitalize on a wave in its favor, the then-ruling Bharatiya Janata Party moved the elections to the summer, and ran on a campaign dubbed "India Shining." The shift backfired and the BJP was booted from power, not to return for a decade. But the summer election schedule stuck.
This year's edition, at six weeks, is one of the longest elections yet. On Tuesday, the country's Election Commission set up a task force to review temperatures and humidity ahead of each successive stage of voting and issue guidance.
The election body often tries to ensure that hotter states wrap up earlier and cooler mountainous regions vote later. But some states find that isn't happening this time.
In the past two national elections, the eastern state of Odisha finished voting in April, before the worst of its summer heat. This year, the state won't begin voting until May and will finish in June, which is worrying the official supervising elections there. Temperatures last week in the state capital reached 110 degrees, a level not usually reached until May.
"Our mission is zero casualties," said Nikunja Bihari Dhal, chief electoral officer in the state. His poll workers will be distributing leaflets offering heatstroke-prevention advice to households before voting starts. Among the recommendations: People should travel to the voting booths with a wet towel on their heads.
To keep voters cool, workers will heap a traditional form of insulation -- cut and tightly packed stalks of harvested rice -- on the roofs of buildings being used as voting stations. He is also considering redirecting agricultural equipment usually used for spraying fertilizer on fields to spray voters with water instead.
"We don't want the heat to affect voter turnout," said Dhal.
Data from the first round of voting shows turnout was down, but officials haven't cited a cause. Low turnout in the northern Hindi heartland states, such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which will vote in every stage, could be a concern for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling BJP, which hopes to win a third term with an expanded majority. The party, in power since 2014, is widely expected to remain there.
On a typical day in the Kottayam district of the southern state of Kerala, lawmaker Thomas Chazhikadan, 71, leaves home by around 7:30 a.m., and is on the road for up to 12 hours.
The vehicle's makeshift roof provides some shade, and he does some of his campaigning at night. Still, within a short time of leaving his house, the undershirt beneath his freshly starched white shirt is drenched. "It is too difficult," he said.
Chazhikadan is well aware of the risks posed by nature. His brother was struck dead by lightning while campaigning in an open-top vehicle in 1991. That personal history has made him philosophical as much as cautious.
"I leave everything to God," he said.

Full text: The Biden administration on Thursday issued sweeping new rules that crack down on power-plant pollution and could force many of the country's coal plants to shutter unless they undertake costly upgrades.
The rules, which will almost certainly be challenged in court, mandate strict controls on carbon-dioxide emissions at existing coal plants and newly built natural-gas plants. They set the stage for a significant infrastructure build-out to capture and dispose of CO2 emitted at such plants in order to comply.
The changes come as the industry juggles the first upswing in power demand in two decades and a shifting generation mix. Solar and wind projects are being added to the grid, and utilities say more gas-fired power plants are needed for reliability and to replace coal. Some utilities say they could need aging coal plants to stay online longer than expected.
Existing gas plants, the backbone of the nation's power supply, aren't included in the new rules.
"The electricity industry is central to America's economic growth and competitiveness. These are the folks who keep the lights on and power our country forward," said Michael Regan, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator. "At the same time, the power sector is also a major contributor to the pollution that drives climate change and threatens public health."
The EPA administrator said the new rules will cut 1.4 billion metric tons of carbon-dioxide emissions, roughly equivalent to the power sector's 2022 emissions, and move the U.S. closer to the Biden administration's goal of making the electricity sector carbon-free by 2035.
Regan said the new rules will amount to $370 billion in climate and public health net benefits over the next two decades. In 2035, the new rules would prevent approximately 1,200 premature deaths and 870 hospital visits, according to Regan.
Carbon emissions from power plants make up around a quarter of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. Vehicles account for the largest source, about 28%. Separate EPA rules issued Thursday will limit pollution from power-plant wastewater, regulate coal ash, and limit air emissions of mercury and other toxic compounds.
Plants operating past 2039 would need to install carbon-capture units before 2032 to comply with the new climate rules, according to EPA officials. A nationwide slowdown in permitting and constructing energy projects will test the utilities' ability to deploy carbon capture and storage, which is mostly untried on a large scale.
While the administration said the timelines for the power-plant rules would give companies time to comply, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association Chief Executive Jim Matheson called the rules unachievable.
"It undermines electric reliability and poses grave consequences for an already-stressed electric grid," said Matheson, whose organization represents many smaller utilities that operate coal plants.
Many power executives say that carbon-capture systems are too experimental, unproven and expensive. Environmentalists say that wider use of the technologies will bring costs down and that the rules would help lower emissions in a major industry that has already been shifting to renewables.
Tax credits for carbon capture in the 2022 climate, health and tax law known as the Inflation Reduction Act, combined with the new EPA rule, will spur both innovation and adoption of the technology, according to David Doniger, senior federal strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. "It's going to cause coal-plant operators who want to keep the plants around to get serious about carbon capture," Doniger said.
Coal plants have struggled financially against natural gas and renewables, and the rules essentially schedule their phaseout, said Daniel Cohan, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University. Most were built before 1990 and would be at least 50 years old by 2040. Their owners would face enormous costs for ongoing maintenance, in addition to the expense of installing a carbon-capture system.
"It's going to be only really special cases where it would make sense to install this technology," Cohan said.
The industry would need to remove CO2 before it goes out of smokestacks, build pipelines to transport it and drill wells that could permanently store the carbon dioxide deep underground in rock formations. Such a build-out faces myriad challenges. Not all parts of the country, for example, have the geology required for storage.
Generators in competitive markets are considered unlikely to make the capital investments that would be needed for older plants, but some utilities or electric co-ops in coal-heavy states might do so and pass the costs on to consumers.

Full text: Salesforce is pushing for more environmental regulation of artificial intelligence, highlighting concerns about energy use and a lack of emissions disclosure within the technology sector.
The software developer said Monday that it will be advocating for lawmakers and regulators to start building legislation to require companies to disclose their AI emissions, with standardized metrics for measuring and reporting the environmental impact of AI systems.
"We really see in this exciting inflection point -- AI has the potential to exacerbate and or alleviate environmental challenges," said Megan Lorenzen, director of climate and energy at the San Francisco-based company.
In particular, Salesforce is calling on all companies employing general-purpose AI models to publicly disclose the energy efficiency and carbon footprint associated with AI development and operations using standard metrics. Doing so, it says, should help drive efficiencies over time as well as allow users to make more informed choices when it comes to using AI and energy use.
It marks one of the first instances that a technology company has looked to add regulation on AI emissions as concerns about sustainability and AI grow.
"If there's visibility there's awareness and pressure on it and that can drive change," Lorenzen said. "We see this as a critical part of our journey to a net zero future -- transparent disclosure."
Salesforce said it would be pressing for the environmental impact of AI systems to be considered as a risk factor when lawmakers classify high-risk models.
"If we as a company don't speak up and work with governments to paint a picture of what a sustainable future looks like we are going to fall short [on climate change goals]," Lorenzen said.
In Washington, Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass), has been one of the leading voices on the subject of regulation over AI, highlighting concerns about the technology and its impact on the environment. Markey and three other Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill in February titled the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024, aimed at developing standards to measure and report the full range of AI's effects on the environment, as well as creating a voluntary framework for AI developers to report the impacts.
"The development of the next generation of AI tools cannot come at the expense of the health of our planet," Markey said at the introduction of the bill.
Emissions from AI have been of increasing concern, largely because of how fast the sector is growing. Energy consumption from data centers represents roughly 1.5% of power generation, according to Lorenzen, but she said this could move to 4.5% in the coming years.
Chip maker Arm's chief executive, Rene Haas, echoed that point earlier this month, saying in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that AI's thirst for energy is going to be unsustainable. "The more information they gather, the smarter they are, but the more information they gather to get smarter, the more power it takes," he said.
Water usage also is a worry, with research from the University of California, Riverside, showing that for every 10 to 50 prompts to OpenAI's ChatGPT-3, the equivalent of a half liter bottle of water is needed to cool the system. OpenAI's founder Sam Altman, among other investors, said this week that they are putting $20 million toward Exowatt, a company that uses solar power to help meet the needs of data centers.
Greg Jackson, CEO of renewable energy provider Octopus Energy, said that demand for energy and in particular green energy is likely to surge as AI use expands, putting pressure on governments to build out grid infrastructure and ramp up renewable power generation.
"Most of the companies building data centers have huge clean-energy commitments so they are going to be driving the change for delivering green electricity at scale," Jackson said. "Data centers can be part of the green-energy solution but through the intelligent use of electricity."
Salesforce echoed this, saying that AI could be a force for good when it comes to climate change. Lorenzen said AI's ability to analyze large sources of data, spot patterns and predict the future based on models can help with climate change mitigation. A recent report from Boston Consulting Group said AI-enabled use cases could reduce carbon emissions by 5% to 10% by 2030.
Jackson's Octopus Energy uses AI to help predict where more energy is going to be needed at a given time, relying on weather data and usage patterns to inform how much power a particular area will need. "You can forecast where you can shift demand and that becomes hyper complex," he said.
Salesforce also is looking to help fund some of the technologies they say are needed to help drive change. "We want to make sure AI benefits everyone, everywhere and that really includes our planet," said Naomi Morenzoni, senior vice president of philanthropy at Salesforce.
The company is putting $2 million toward five companies looking to use AI to accelerate decarbonization. This includes WattTime, a nonprofit focused on getting companies, people and countries to choose cleaner energy, and Good360, a nonprofit which helps provide communities in need with aid and supplies in the wake of climate disasters.

Full text: Should corporate executives' pay be tied to climate-related goals?
More company boards think so, as awareness grows that climate change could have an impact on corporate bottom lines. Some 54% of S&P 500 companies incorporated climate-related metrics into their executives' compensation plans in 2023 -- more than double the figure from two years earlier, according to a January report from the Conference Board and ESGauge, a data analytics firm.
But experts say how a company ties pay to climate is crucial, with some methods more effective than others. Here's a look at some of those approaches.
Use science-based metrics
For starters, climate-related goals have to be firmly rooted in science, says David Larcker, a professor and director of the Corporate Governance Research Initiative at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
Companies that are serious about rewarding for climate goals should also break down their long-term targets into smaller, clearly achievable and measurable goals, says Larcker, who is also a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, a public-policy think tank. Companies should be sure to audit reported metrics for accuracy, he adds.
The metrics will differ by company, depending on where the biggest impact can be made, says John McCalla-Leacy, head of global ESG at KPMG International. He has clients, for instance, that focus heavily on reducing emissions within their supply chain, while others focus more on reducing emissions within their own operations.
"We believe that the best metrics for sustainability initiatives have a clear tie to the underlying business model and strategy," says John Borneman, managing director of compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy. So, for example, an energy or distribution company will have a significant focus on carbon emissions, while a real-estate company will focus on energy efficiency, or a consumer-products company on sustainable sourcing and waste reduction, he says.
Quantitative, not qualitative
Once goals are set, compensation should be tied directly to them, not to some vague broader aspiration beyond the metrics, compensation experts and climate advocates say. Offering incentive pay for goals like "adhering to the company's climate plan" can risk rewarding executives who don't take any action.
As You Sow, a nonprofit foundation that promotes corporate social responsibility, scored 100 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, across 11 sectors of the economy, on their climate-rewards programs. It gave its highest grade, a B, to Dow. The company moved up from a D-minus in 2022 by replacing an "unmeasurable climate-related metric" with a quantitative emissions-reduction metric in its CEO's long-term compensation package, according to the foundation. A Dow spokesperson says the company's long-term compensation program is aligned with its emissions-reduction targets.
Think long term
It's more common for companies to build incentives into executives' annual compensation plans rather than their long-term plans. About 86% of companies in the Russell 3000 index that incorporated ESG performance metrics in incentives used annual incentives in 2023, according to data from the Conference Board and ESGauge. Only about 8% put ESG measures in their executives' long-term plan last year, and about 5% did both.
Some critics say annual incentives aren't enough, since long-term incentive programs typically represent the majority of CEOs' variable pay. Climate incentives should be a significant part of long-term compensation, they say.
As You Sow recommends that companies aim to make at least 5% of the total "performance shares" in their CEO's long-term incentive plan relate to climate goals. Performance shares are an incentive-based form of stock compensation paid to executives for meeting certain benchmarks. "It can't be so small in comparison to other payouts that it would not incentivize action," says Danielle Fugere, president and chief counsel of As You Sow.
Of the 100 companies studied by As You Sow, Xcel Energy stood out with the highest weighting of climate-related long-term incentives, at 30% of total incentives. Three other companies -- PPL, Dow and Valero Energy -- assigned a weight greater than 10% to climate metrics, while five companies -- Ameren, Southern, American Electric Power, Dominion Energy and EQT -- gave climate incentives a 10% weight.
Build in flexibility
Even companies that are moving toward their climate targets can have setbacks due to reasons beyond their control, so there needs to be some flexibility built into compensation plans, says Paul Washington, executive director of the Conference Board ESG Center.
He offers the example of an acquisition in which the target company has significant greenhouse-gas emissions. As a combined company, overall emissions will be elevated, at least temporarily. In such cases, companies could exclude the acquired company's emissions for compensation purposes, allowing executives to be paid for the things within their control, he says.
Companies can also be flexible by giving executives partial rewards for efforts that fall short of the established goals. For instance, a compensation plan could call for an equity bonus of 100,000 shares for a 10% reduction in the company's carbon footprint but fewer shares for a smaller reduction, Larcker says.
Forge ahead
Some advocates of corporate action on climate issues urge companies to at least start feeling their way toward tying executive compensation to climate metrics.
"We don't think you should let perfect get in the way of good," says Steven Rothstein, managing director of the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets. "If they have a good plan, but it's not a perfect plan, we think they should start implementing that plan and update it as necessary."

Full text: At one of the world's oldest universities, two M.B.A. candidates are trying to do something that has never been done before: get future business leaders to make a careerlong commitment to combat climate change.
Collin Janich and Peter Golding, students at the University of Cambridge's Judge Business School, are creating a pledge for M.B.A. candidates at the world's top business schools to commit to championing sustainable initiatives and fighting for a net-zero future for the rest of their careers.
"Nothing exists challenging future business leaders," Janich said. "We're in a position to impact change so this is a call to action to transform business leadership and put climate change into business leadership."
The duo, who met on the first day of their program in September, launched the Climate Legacy Commitment, or CLC, last month. It was founded on the idea that M.B.A. students hold a level of power when it comes to effecting change in future business practices, and that after graduating they will have more control when it comes to enacting day-to-day business decisions. So, if climate awareness is integrated, then operations as a whole can become more sustainable, they say.
"A core tenet for us is that in every decision we want sustainability principles to be integrated. Something to carry forward as a philosophy for every decision no matter how big or small," Golding said.
So far, the pair have signed on close to 300 candidates from the top seven business schools in the U.S., including Columbia Business School, Harvard Business School and MIT, as well as eight schools in Europe, such as the University of Oxford's Said and HEC Paris.
The pledge itself isn't binding, and the current cohort won't be graduating until the fall of this year, so it is unclear how companies will take the declaration into consideration when hiring. But Janich and Golding both hope that by signing up, it would be a lifetime commitment for those candidates to try to drive climate action. "It's giving people an opportunity to signal to future employers [their intentions]," Golding said. Signees also gain a badge on LinkedIn showing they have signed up for the pledge.
For example, if a candidate goes on to work for a company in the artificial-intelligence space, then trying to reduce water and energy usage could be one way they enact change, given the huge amounts of power and cooling needed to fulfill the demands of AI data servers. Pushing for a switch to renewable energy could be another. "It's not a purity test," Janich said. "It's not a stick approach, it's more of a carrot approach trying to meet M.B.A. candidates where they are. People who want to make a difference."
Gishan Dissanaike, interim dean of Cambridge Judge Business School, which is a sponsor of the project, said there is demand for more teaching and support on climate change from students at the school and from the boards of directors at companies that the school works with, noting its growing importance from a corporate perspective.
"We are seeing a change, not only in relation to sustainability but in doing work which is not socially harmful," Dissanaike said. "People do like earning money but they also want to make a positive social impact too." He added that employers will still likely be hiring candidates based on their subject matter expertise, not climate credentials, but the pledge could act as a bonus.
Schools in the U.S. have seen similar demand. At the Wharton School, 10% of its M.B.A. candidates are now majoring in ESG, with it ranking among the top five majors alongside core subjects such as finance, accounting and management.
Before life at Cambridge, Janich who hails from Birmingham, Ala., had worked for the energy giant Exxon Mobil as a senior adviser on climate policy and ESG.
He said that during his time there, colleagues did want to take ESG and climate change seriously but were unsure about how to engage on the issue in a meaningful way, which was part of the reason he looked to found the pledge. Creating networking opportunities through the CLC should allow people from different sectors to learn how to approach the subject and create change within their respective fields, Janich said.

LeapFrog Investments Sees Benefits From Lower Costs of Clean Energy

Full text: Leaders of impact-focused LeapFrog Investments said the declining costs of clean-energy technologies make it easier to convince investors it can produce financial returns along with benefits to communities and the environment -- despite a broad retreat from many fund strategies that also make such claims.
LeapFrog, which is run from Mauritius and invests in developing markets in Africa and Asia, looks to back businesses involved in solar energy, transportation and agriculture through a newly formed climate investment strategy. At the same time it seeks to invest in other sectors, such as healthcare and financial services, from other pools.
In its latest deal, LeapFrog said last week it led a $48 million investment in Electronica Finance, a provider of loans to small and midsize businesses in India, including for rooftop-solar installations.
"Twenty years ago, those were premium technologies and low-income people don't pay a premium," LeapFrog founder and Chief Executive Andy Kuper said, referring to solar power and electric vehicles. "Now those technologies are cheaper -- you're not saying to the consumer, 'Pay a big premium and we'll sell you a dream.' You're saying, 'This is more affordable.'"
Government incentives and decreased costs of solar panels in India make rooftop solar power increasingly attractive to consumers, according to industry analysts. A projected record of four gigawatts of rooftop power capacity was forecast to be installed across the subcontinent during a 12-month period ended in March, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit that promotes the shift to clean energy.
India's electric-vehicle market is experiencing a similar trend, said Nakul Zaveri, a LeapFrog partner who co-leads the firm's climate investment strategy. He pointed to the rising demand for electric bicycles and scooters. EVs are expected to account for 60% to 70% of India's new sales of two-wheel vehicles by 2030, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co. India's ubiquitous two-wheelers represent more than 70% of all vehicles on the road there.
Rising adoption of solar energy and electric vehicles in developing regions creates opportunities for impact investors to back clean-energy businesses, as they can more easily show both the potential for returns and social benefits, Zaveri said.
The same is true of other sectors in which LeapFrog invests, such as healthcare and financial services, he said. LeapFrog has said its portfolio companies provide services or products to nearly 500 million people.
"In emerging markets, financial returns cannot exist without having a social premium to consumer businesses because 95% of their target audience is low-income," Zaveri said.
The company last year pledged to invest $500 million in businesses that help address climate change, with the backing of Temasek Holdings in Singapore and the European Investment Bank. Temasek roughly three years ago committed $500 million across LeapFrog funds, including $100 million for its new climate strategy.
LeapFrog's concentration on businesses that cater to low-income consumers also helps differentiate the firm from other fund managers focused on broader environmental, social and corporate governance benefits, Kuper said. Investor enthusiasm for so-called ESG strategies has waned in recent months.
"Impact focuses on a much narrower set of opportunities that have positive outcomes," he said. "You're not just trying to take everything in the world and make sure it doesn't have negative outcomes. You're selecting certain things that rightly you think have measurable positive outcomes. It's been both narrower and more rigorous than ESG."
Asked why many investors are still reluctant to put money in emerging markets, Kuper said government incentives for clean energy products in developed countries outshine other alternatives, but will eventually fade. Meanwhile, he said, wide use of smartphones reduces investment risks in emerging markets by enabling businesses to reach customers directly and decentralize operations.
As an example, he cited LeapFrog's investment about seven years ago in Goodlife Pharmacy, which operates in East Africa, comparing it with a hypothetical investment in a large hospital. Goodlife's roughly 140 pharmacies provide services such as diagnosing illnesses and nutritional advice. Many locations also have telemedicine rooms that enable rural customers to speak to a doctor remotely.
Goodlife can set up a new store in a month or two, while developing a new hospital probably would take years, Kuper said. Goodlife operations in rural areas serve scattered populations whose income wouldn't support a locally situated hospital, he added.
"I think there's been a material change in the last five to 10 years and it's driven by the mobile phone, the billions of people who are now on the grid and so many of the middlemen are cut out," Kuper said.

Full text: President Biden has done more to address climate change than any of his predecessors. So far, voters don't seem to care.
The Biden campaign and a collection of progressive groups are trying to change that. They believe the president's record on climate change can boost his popularity with young voters.
The strategy is risky because climate has never been a priority with voters. And it is unclear whether climate policies could reverse the deep skepticism many young people feel toward Biden. Recent Wall Street Journal polls have found that Biden's support among young people is shrinking compared with 2020 amid concerns about the president's age and his support for Israel's war against Hamas.
Their first big challenge is to tell voters what Biden has accomplished. Paris Thompson, 19, of Philadelphia, said Biden hasn't done enough on climate change: "Since he's been president, I don't think anything has changed." A Democrat, Thompson said she is considering voting for independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
A Journal poll that surveyed voters in seven swing states in March found that just 3% of 18-to-34-year-old voters named climate change as their top issue, with most citing the economy, inflation or immigration. That is roughly in line with voters of all ages, 2% of whom cited climate change as their top issue. Other polls show that young people are more likely than older voters to say addressing climate change is important, even if many don't name it as their priority.
Biden administration officials say climate is an economic issue, and funding will create new jobs and industries in many communities. They are pushing to get cash out the door to show the economic impact.
The Biden campaign hopes to highlight the differences between Biden and Donald Trump, who dismisses worries about climate change. Trump has criticized subsidies for electric cars while promising to increase domestic production of oil and gas. U.S. fossil-fuel output has risen to record levels under Biden.
Biden's economic policies have been unpopular with a majority of voters surveyed in recent Journal polls. More than 60% of voters surveyed by the Yale University Program on Climate Change Communication said they have heard "a little" or "nothing at all" about the 2022 law known as the Inflation Reduction Act, which contained about $1 trillion in tax credits, grants and loans for clean energy.
"The community and the population doesn't know about them, so it seems like nothing is being done," said Rebekah Pike, a 38-year-old undecided voter in Bay City, Mich. Climate change is one of her top issues, but she hadn't heard about the climate law or other policies before talking to the Journal.
Climate change is disrupting Michigan's winters and threatening the state's farmers, whose products range from asparagus to cherries. A physical-education and health teacher and nurse, Pike said she would welcome more investments in Bay City, like an SK Siltron CSS factory making semiconductor wafers for electric vehicles that opened a few years ago.
The Energy Department recently said it would lend the facility $544 million to help fund an expansion and create 200 jobs in the city. Bay City is home to some 30,000 people, with about one in four living in poverty.
Other recent loan commitments include $2.3 billion for a lithium producer in Nevada and $1.5 billion for a nuclear-power plant in Michigan.
After hearing that the climate law is spurring similar investments across the country, Pike said she was more likely to vote for Biden. She isn't alone. The Yale poll found that more than 70% of voters surveyed supported the Inflation Reduction Act after reading a brief description of it. But several young voters said in interviews they knew little about Biden's climate efforts.
Privately, senior officials expressed frustration that their efforts weren't resonating with the public. But they held out hope that voters will become more engaged on the issue as the election nears. "We need to show our work along the way because these investments do take time," a White House official said.
Private groups are bolstering the campaign's message about climate change. Climate Power, a clean-energy communications organization, is spending $80 million this year to promote Biden's climate actions. Much of the group's activity targets swing states and younger voters with digital campaigns.
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending $200 million to help cities and towns access their share of the federal clean-energy funding. A group called Invest in Our Future has about $240 million in funding commitments from organizations including Bill Gates's Breakthrough Energy and the Rockefeller Foundation for similar initiatives. The League of Conservation Voters' super PAC and affiliated groups plan to spend $120 million this election cycle, the largest investment in the group's history.

Elderly Women Win
Climate Lawsuit
The European Court of Human Rights ruled 16-1 in favor of a group of more than 2,000 elderly women from across Switzerland who brought a case claiming their government isn't doing enough to fight climate change, putting them at risk of death from heat waves.
In what is being seen as a landmark decision, the court found that the European Convention on Human Rights "encompasses a right to effective protection by the State authorities from the serious adverse effects of climate change on lives, health, well-being and quality of life." Given this, it said current efforts by the Swiss government were lacking, including a failure to quantify limits on greenhouse-gas-emissions.
"Climate campaigners are likely to seize on the conclusion that states have positive obligations under human-rights law in relation to climate change, and use it as the basis for future claims against states which they deem to not be moving quickly enough to address the threat of climate change," said Tom Cummins, partner at global law firm Ashurst.

IRELAND
Young Lawmaker Is
Now Prime Minister
Lawmaker Simon Harris was elected Ireland's taoiseach, or prime minister, by Parliament Tuesday, becoming at 37 the country's youngest-ever leader.
Harris takes over as head of a three-party coalition government from Leo Varadkar, who announced his surprise resignation last month. Harris, who served as higher education minister in Varadkar's government, was the only person running to succeed him.
The Dail, the lower house of Ireland's Parliament, confirmed Harris by an 88-69 vote. He was formally appointed to the post by President Michael D. Higgins.
First elected to Parliament at 24, Harris faces challenges including a strained health service, soaring housing costs and an exodus of lawmakers from his center-right Fine Gael party. More than 10 have said they will not run for re-election.
Harris has said he plans to keep the coalition government -- his party, Fianna Fail and the Green Party -- going until next March, when an election is required. Opposition parties argue that the people deserve an early election.

'God Particle'
Physicist Dies
Nobel Prize-winning physicist Peter Higgs, who proposed the existence of the "God particle" that helped explain how matter formed after the Big Bang, has died at age 94, the University of Edinburgh said Tuesday.
The university, where Higgs was emeritus professor, said he died Monday "peacefully at home following a short illness."
Higgs predicted the particle -- which became known as the Higgs boson -- in 1964. But its existence wasn't confirmed for nearly 50 years.
Higgs's theory related to how subatomic particles that are the building blocks of matter get their mass. This theoretical understanding is a central part of the so-called Standard Model, which describes the physics of how the universe operates.
In one of the biggest physics breakthroughs in decades, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research announced in 2012 that they had finally found a Higgs boson using the Large Hadron Collider, the $10 billion particle accelerator built in a 17-mile tunnel under the Swiss-French border.

Full text: Robert Howarth is getting under the skin of the oil-and-gas industry. The climate scientist says he doesn't care.
Howarth, a methane researcher at Cornell University, said in a recent study that exports of liquefied natural gas from the U.S. were so bad for the climate that ending the use of LNG should be a global priority. The research influenced President Biden's decision in January to pause new approvals of LNG exports.
The turn of events riled executives in the fracking industry -- especially at Pittsburgh-based EQT, the country's largest natural-gas producer.
The fracker says U.S. LNG, can help reduce carbon emissions abroad. EQT is campaigning to quadruple the nation's export capacity by 2030.
William Jordan, EQT's general counsel, said Howarth crossed the line between research and advocacy, and his work contributes to a false narrative that shutting down natural-gas pipelines and blocking LNG plants helps mitigate climate change.
After Republicans and Democrats in Washington last year asked EQT about Howarth's research, EQT did a deep dive into the scientist's work. It raised questions about Howarth's methods and ties to anti-fracking groups, according to people familiar with the matter. The Independent Petroleum Association of America recently described his research as "biased and agenda-driven."
Said Howarth, "The oil-and-gas industry has a track record of trying to trash the reputations of scientists whose results they do not like."
Gas producers argue says rising global coal consumption proves that developing nations can't just leap to renewables and need a cleaner substitute.
But opposition to new natural-gas infrastructure, which will produce added greenhouse gas emissions for decades, is ramping up. Environmentalists have singled out exports of U.S. LNG, saying they hurt the climate, the U.S. economy and local communities.
Howarth said both academics and activists encouraged him to research the greenhouse gas footprint of U.S. LNG. He concluded that leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, made LNG exports worse than burning coal over 20 years. Last fall, he publicly shared his analysis before it had undergone peer review.
Green activists and Democratic lawmakers cited the research as they lobbied the Biden administration to block planned LNG terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Jordan said Howarth eschewed scientific accountability as he sought to influence policymaking by releasing his study before peer review.
"If we're not following science, scientific consensus, then any single scientist can influence policy decisions for the good or for the bad," he said.
Howarth said he would have preferred his work go through a peer-review process before publication. But he said he trusted his findings, and that he had an ethical duty to participate in an important debate in a timely manner.
In a way, Howarth had been on a collision course with EQT for years. The company says the U.S. sits on so much cheap natural gas that it could supply global markets for decades and help phase out global coal use. EQT Chief Executive Toby Rice has advocated erecting new LNG terminals on the East Coast.
Jordan said Howarth's argument that shale gas is worse for the climate than coal relies on flawed assumptions about how much methane coal and shale gas emit, and that the scientist is cherry-picking data. He said research involving academics and partly funded by EQT has found that at least in some parts of Appalachia where it operates, coal mines emit much more methane than shale-gas operations.
Howarth said he categorically denied Jordan's assertion that his assumptions are flawed or that he is selectively picking data. He noted he is one of the most cited scientists in the world, and said that overall, his research had been received positively by the rest of the scientific community.
Howarth serves on the board of Food & Water Watch, a nonprofit that supports a national ban on fracking. The Park Foundation, which opposes shale gas, has funded his work in part, including his LNG analysis. Jordan said these ties could be conflicts of interest.
Howarth said his paper clearly states that his work was funded in part by a grant from the Park Foundation, and that the foundation had no control whatsoever on the analysis. He doesn't receive compensation from Food & Water Watch for his directorship.

Full text: The Canadian province of Quebec has big plans of becoming the "battery of the U.S. northeast" by feeding power generated from its dams and other hydro plants to millions of people in Vermont, Massachusetts and New York state. But dry conditions that have affected energy output worldwide are forcing one of the world's largest hydropower producers to cut exports.
"There wasn't enough snow or rain in the regions where we needed it," said Michael Sabia, chief executive of Hydro-Quebec, the provincial utility.
Elsewhere, China, India and the U.S. in 2023 all recorded decreases in their hydro production for the same reason, contributing to a record global decline in hydropower generation, according to the International Energy Agency. Many countries resorted to fossil-fuel electricity generation to make up for the hydro shortfall, which drove up carbon-dioxide emissions by 170 megatons in 2023, roughly equal to the annual emissions from 40 million gas-powered cars.
"Drought is a big concern," said Lei Xie, a researcher with the International Hydropower Association, a London-based nonprofit group. She said it is becoming more difficult for forecasters to model the extremes of climate change, and predict from year-to-year how much electricity local hydroelectric systems will generate.
Canada bet heavily on hydro as a means of cleaning up its carbon footprint; it is the third-largest hydroelectricity producer in the world. But with the climate becoming markedly drier, Canada's utilities are investing hundreds of billions of dollars to diversify their grids, in some cases leaning on power plants fueled by gas or coal to meet demand.
Hydro power from the thousands of rivers and streams that crisscross Canada normally provides about 60% of the country's electricity. Canada's resources are enormous. The water reservoirs in Quebec alone collectively cover more than 4,600 square miles, nearly double the area of Delaware.
But drought conditions extending from the west coast to the east are so bad that rivers and lakes in parts of Canada are drying up. Provincial authorities have cut back on exports, and, in some cases, turned to backup generators.
Etienne Boucher, a professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal, said water flows into Quebec's reservoirs fell far below the mean levels observed between 1980 and 2000.
While one bad year shouldn't cause too much concern, the north often has periods of persistent drought, and climate change could make those periods much worse, threatening the sustainability of Quebec's hydro supply, Boucher said. "The past is becoming less of a good analog for what is going to occur in the future," he said.
The impact threatens to undermine Canada's reputation as a stable provider of clean and sustainable energy, and risks derailing the nation's efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.
The province of British Columbia, Canada's second-largest hydro producer, has been in a drought since the middle of 2022. Water levels in the giant reserves in the northern and southeastern regions of British Columbia have fallen because there has been less snow in the winter and less rain in the spring, forcing the province to conserve water, said a spokesman for BC Hydro, the provincial utility.
Canada's largest hydro producer, Quebec, has staked much of its economic future on its ability to deliver clean energy. The province has pitched itself to emissions-conscious battery manufacturers and mining companies as a provider of clean electricity with rates that are among the lowest in North America.
It has also been hoping to export power to U.S. states, marketing itself as a virtually unparalleled provider of abundant and reliable renewable power. The province has signed long-term contracts with Massachusetts and New York state to provide about 20 terawatt hours of power to the states, enough to provide electricity to 1.6 million homes for a year.

Full text: The Securities and Exchange Commission may have dialed back the extent of its new corporate climate-disclosure rule, but finance chiefs still face plenty of challenges and costs as they prepare to comply.
"There is still a significant amount of work that people will need to do to figure out what disclosures they're going to make," said Eric Juergens, a corporate partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton. "Even if they've done a good portion of the work, there will be more to do."
The securities regulator last week said it would require companies to report emissions from their operations and from energy purchases, also known as Scope 1 and 2, but not certain indirect emissions. That was a backtrack from an SEC proposal in 2022 that would have required companies to disclose Scope 3 emissions, including from their supply chain, as well.
Companies had criticized the proposed Scope 3 reporting mandate as complex and costly. But tackling Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosures for the first time will be far from effortless for many companies.
"I don't think anybody looked at the rule and said, 'Oh, thank goodness, this is going to be super easy,'" said Steve Soter, vice president and industry principal at business-reporting software provider Workiva. "I don't think anybody's saying that. But by comparison, it has gotten a little bit less effort-intensive."
The most challenging part of the rule for companies will likely be obtaining a high level of assurance on their Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse-gas emissions, Soter said.
Some companies' sustainability teams aren't used to the level of regulatory scrutiny that financial-reporting personnel are, but both teams will need to jointly own climate data under the new rules, Soter said.
The requirements could prompt companies to invest more in technology and seek consultants' help to facilitate the review and strengthen their controls, he said.
Retaining an accounting or consulting firm to provide those verifications would be an additional cost for companies that aren't already doing so, said Susan Mac Cormac, a partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster. "There's a lot of evolution that has to happen there because it needs to be independent and third party."
Autodesk, the San Francisco-based software company, made some nominal investments to enhance its team's skills and capacity over the past year, making it well-positioned to comply with the new rule, Chief Financial Officer Debbie Clifford said. The company will need to address certain SEC requirements, such as disclosures in its audited financial statement footnotes, she said. "Now that we have the specifics of the SEC ruling more squarely in focus, we believe that the investments we've already made will suffice for us as we look to comply," Clifford said.
The SEC, in the rule it issued on Wednesday, said the average annual compliance costs for companies over the first 10 years could range from less than $197,000 to over $739,000.
The continued addition of costs and regulatory risks in the U.S. are significant factors discouraging companies from entering the public markets, said Jay Clayton, a former chairman for the securities regulator and now a senior policy adviser at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.
"Our public markets are generally now only appropriate for our largest companies" because they are the ones that can afford the high costs, he said.
Payroll and HR solutions company Paychex supported the SEC's move to omit Scope 3 reporting requirements from the rule. Reporting those emissions would have been "inherently difficult" for many public companies to quantify with the degree of accuracy required, Paychex CFO Bob Schrader said.

Full text: Rep. John Curtis leads a rather unusual climate coalition.
The 63-year-old Republican congressman from Utah founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in the House of Representatives three years ago. Since then, the caucus's main mission has been to get its members comfortable with thinking and talking about climate -- regardless of where they are on the issue.
One member, Rep. Paul Gosar (R., Ariz.), famously boycotted a speech by the pope in 2015, after it became clear His Holiness would devote the bulk of the talk to climate change. Another was lambasted by environmentalists for telling constituents in 2017 that if climate change was a problem, God "can take care of it." (The legislator, Rep. Timothy Walberg of Michigan, says his views were misrepresented and that he believes people need to take action.)
None of the caucus's members voted for the Biden administration's signature climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Many have lobbied fiercely against parts of it. Two members have scored zero on the left-leaning League of Conservation Voters' tally of how frequently lawmakers have supported environmentally friendly legislation. The average score for the 80-plus members of the caucus hovers a bit above 8%.
Curtis, whose own score is 6%, is unfazed. The slim, amiable Mormon, a leading contender for the Senate seat being vacated by Mitt Romney, is known for his flashy sock collection and chatty videos on social media -- including a post with Arnold Schwarzenegger and a series during last year's House leadership battle titled "Friends don't let friends become Speaker."
"Part of our success is that we don't judge people on where they're at on this issue," he says. "It doesn't matter to me if they struggle with climate. It doesn't matter to me if they don't like the science. All that matters to me is that they'll come and listen. . . . I have found that the more they come, the more they talk about this, the more comfortable they get with it."
That kid-gloves approach has made the group one of the biggest caucuses in the House.
Despite the low marks in the eyes of many environmentalists, the caucus represents an evolution for many Republicans on climate change. The group -- one of a growing number of conservative organizations weighing in on climate issues -- says it believes the climate is changing and the global industrial era is contributing to it.
That is a "positive evolution" from a decade or so ago, when most Republican lawmakers said climate change didn't exist or humans weren't the cause, says Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, the senior Democrat on the House energy and climate subcommittee.
But the caucus also holds that fossil fuels will play a "major part" in global climate solutions and that attention should focus on lowering their emissions rather than phasing them out. That position puts the caucus in opposition to many mainstream environmental groups as well as much of President Biden's climate agenda.
Although the caucus doesn't endorse legislation, its members have sponsored many bills aimed at undoing the administration's green policies.
Those include a bill sponsored by Rep. August Pfluger, who represents an oil-and-gas-producing district in West Texas, aimed at reversing the Biden administration's decision to freeze approvals for liquefied-natural-gas exports. Pfluger says exporting more American fossil fuel lowers the world's emissions because the U.S. produces it more cleanly than other global suppliers -- a stance cheered by U.S. energy companies and booed by environmentalists.
"If you're acknowledging that the climate crisis is real and then you're standing in the way of solutions, that's really not impressive," says Tiernan Sittenfeld, a top lobbyist for the League of Conservation Voters.
The growing Republican movement to engage on climate issues comes as the U.S. increasingly grapples with everything from record heat and wildfires to eroding coastlines -- effects that scientists say are worsened by a rapidly warming world.
Younger conservatives are particularly concerned; two-thirds of Republicans between the ages of 18 and 29 believe the U.S. should take steps to achieve the goal set by the Biden administration of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, according to a 2022 Pew Research Center survey.
A former shooting-range developer with an outdoorsy streak, Curtis spent eight years as mayor of Provo, Utah, where he championed clean-air measures. In D.C., however, he found that "people didn't really want to talk clean air; they wanted to talk carbon," he says.
That was an uncomfortable topic for Curtis, whose district includes a coal and natural-gas-rich region called Carbon County. But Curtis's district is also one of the youngest in the country, and many of his constituents were concerned about global warming.
By 2021 he had decided there was a middle ground that would let him work on emissions reduction without embracing all the left's policies.
Curtis kept the caucus's mission educational, holding roundtable discussions every six weeks with everyone from former U.S. climate czar John Kerry to CEOs of green startups. He took colleagues to United Nations climate summits, on hikes in Utah and on study trips.
Still, some caucus members say that just talking about the issue can be politically risky, especially during an election year.
The caucus has some secret participants "that aren't ready to come out, as it were," says Michigan's Walberg. He says he tackles the issue head on with his own constituents, explaining at town halls how he can address climate issues and still be a conservative. "When I would mention I was a member of the Conservative Climate Caucus, I'd quickly say: Does that scare you?" he says.
Curtis, who is facing increased attention because of his Senate run, is walking a fine line between touting his environmental efforts and his conservative credentials.
Climate is only one of the issues he advocates for, Curtis says, but "that all gets lost, because it's so unique to have a Republican who is willing to talk about this."

Full text: When John Kerry recently decided to step down as the U.S. special envoy for climate -- ending a yearslong marathon of globe-trotting and 11th-hour negotiations -- his daughter suggested organizing a get-together to mark the occasion.
The 80-year-old statesman bristled at the notion. "Hey, I'm not quitting. I'm not retiring," Kerry recalled telling her. "I don't want to view this with finality of some kind."
Letting go of public office is hard, especially when you see your job as saving the planet. Kerry has been instrumental in driving the transition to renewable energy, prodding Wall Street and the oil industry to unleash billions in green investments. And for more than a decade, he has been on the front lines of the unruly process for implementing the landmark Paris accord, which seeks to limit global warming and stave off the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Kerry is stepping down on Wednesday as that fight is on a knife's edge. Record heat in January for the first time pushed the earth's 12-month average temperature beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels -- a key threshold of the Paris agreement. China, the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter, is rolling out renewable-energy infrastructure at an unprecedented scale while also continuing to burn copious amounts of coal.
In the U.S., the Biden administration has unleashed hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies that aim to green the economy, but a presidential election is months away. Donald Trump -- who as president pulled the U.S. out of the Paris accord -- is leading the polls and, if he wins, says he wants the U.S. "drilling like you have never seen before."
Looming over the election is the question of whether the 81-year-old President Biden -- and 77-year-old Trump -- are simply too old to hold the country's highest office. Age didn't drive Kerry's decision to leave. Staying in his post, Kerry said in an interview, didn't make sense in an election year when a gridlocked Congress is unlikely to take action on the climate or any other issue.
John Podesta, Biden's senior adviser for global climate policy, is slated to take over Kerry's duties. Then Kerry plans to hit the road as a private citizen, dropping in on a major oil-industry conference in Houston to press energy executives to join the ranks of business leaders throwing their weight behind the transition. Companies are now deeply invested in green technologies, Kerry said, creating momentum that no one can stop, not even Trump.
"While someone could disrupt and can get in the way a bit, they're not going to end this transition," he said.
Kerry's signature mane has whitened over the years, but he hasn't lost his command of policy details. In the middle of conversation, he will recite paragraphs of legalese -- drawn from paragraph 28 of the latest United Nations climate agreement, he notes -- or rattle off the number of gigawatts of renewable power China expects to install by the end of the decade. He cites analyst reports estimating the energy transition will require investments of up to $5 trillion annually for the next 30 years.
"I think that helping to deploy the money necessary to do the R&D, to bring to scale some of these projects, to accelerate the transition, I think that's where the action is," Kerry said. "I feel very energized, superfocused."
But some of Kerry's counterparts in capitals around the globe worry his departure from government marks the end of a distinctly inclusive era in climate negotiations. Kerry's clout as a longtime senator and the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, officials say, allowed him to bring disparate parties to the table and navigate political land mines. His diplomacy with China fueled criticism from Republicans while his outreach to oil executives such as ExxonMobil Chief Executive Darren Woods and Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, head of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., angered climate activists.
"There's no solution if we don't get everyone on board," said Dan Jorgensen, Denmark's minister for global climate policy and a key negotiator at the annual U.N. conference of parties, or COP, meetings. Kerry, Jorgensen said, "is a very skilled man when it comes to knowing the character of people and finding out who to trust and who not to trust."
One person Kerry trusts is 74-year-old Xie Zhenhua, China's climate envoy. The men have known each other for decades. When Kerry was secretary of state under President Barack Obama, he hammered out an agreement with Xie that laid the groundwork for the U.S. and China to sign the Paris accord in 2015.
Making further progress on climate change, Kerry said, hinged on both sides' agreeing to treat the issue separately from the myriad tensions dividing Washington and Beijing. That meant setting aside disagreements over Taiwan as well as Beijing's treatment of Hong Kong and the ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in China's Xinjiang region.
"These are serious issues, and they are issues of contention," Kerry said. "But on the other hand, both Xie Zhenhua and I believe that climate was not a bilateral issue, that it's a global issue."

Full text: Climate investing is booming at BlackRock. Just don't call it ESG.
After crusading for years for investment funds and companies to take into account environmental, social and governance factors, Larry Fink has purged the letters from his vocabulary.
He attempted to use BlackRock's clout as the steward for millions of investors to prod companies toward climate-friendly policies and press them to disclose the social effects of their businesses. He long argued that the world's largest asset manager and its peers could simultaneously make money and make the world a better place.
Fast forward to 2024, and the chief executive has stopped mentioning the abbreviation in public letters and comments. He retreated after a conservative backlash against "woke capitalism" made the term politically toxic. Furthermore, he faced criticism, even in the finance industry, that he was moralizing, playing God and stepping beyond BlackRock's fiduciary duty to maximize financial returns for clients.
BlackRock is still wagering that fighting climate change will be a generational investment opportunity -- but is no longer pushing for changes in corporate behavior, talking about hard-to-quantify social issues or actively promoting ESG investing criteria. Instead, it is directing billions of client dollars toward infrastructure projects that will help speed the transition from fossil fuels.
"Transition investing is specific and concrete. Clients know what we're talking about," said Mark Wiedman, who is head of the global client business at BlackRock and a potential successor to Fink. "ESG as a category is a vague grab bag for many clients."
BlackRock is joining investors such as Brookfield Asset Management in betting on clean-energy infrastructure projects. It doubled down with its recent $12.5 billion deal for Global Infrastructure Partners, a fund manager that owns and operates energy, transportation, and waste and water companies around the world.
Infrastructure investments can offer steady returns and measurable benefits for fighting climate change. They are in high demand with institutional clients such as pensions, especially after 2022's climate law introduced rich government subsidies for clean-energy projects.
The investments differ from many bets on publicly traded companies or ESG strategies that avoid fossil-fuel projects that end up being owned by someone else. BlackRock's infrastructure funds have invested in solar power, natural gas made from food waste and cow manure and removing carbon from the atmosphere.
Another reason the ESG movement failed to catch on was because the funds struggled to outpace the broader market and show that they actually benefited the planet. Investors pulled about $13 billion, or about 4% of assets, from publicly traded ESG funds last year, according to Morningstar. BlackRock's offering of mostly index-tracking ESG funds posted inflows.
Investors poured about $75 billion into private renewable-energy and broad energy-sector investment funds over the same period. The funds have raised nearly $500 billion in the past five years and dwarfed the amount raised for traditional fossil-fuel funds, figures from Preqin show.
The criticism of Fink started building in 2020, when he said BlackRock would be disposed to vote against management and boards at companies not making progress on sustainability-related practices. With its colossal index-fund business, BlackRock wields vast shareholder voting power.
A year later, Fink upped the ante when he wrote that BlackRock was "focused on racial equity and social justice in our investment and stewardship activities."
The backlash was swift. Even Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger said: "I think the world of Fink, but I am not sure I want him to be my emperor." Conservative activist Leonard Leo financed an anti-ESG campaign. Republican presidential candidates took jabs, and some red states sought to ban BlackRock.
The rebuke had little to no measurable impact on BlackRock's business -- but it marked an embarrassment for Fink, a legend on Wall Street who co-founded the company in 1988.
Within BlackRock, some executives were uneasy about the letters and Fink's public comments, according to people familiar with the matter. Some remarks were made on the fly, the people said, leaving executives struggling to explain to clients what their boss meant.
BlackRock has since made a U-turn and is trying to smooth things over with its political enemies. Fink told The Wall Street Journal in October that he backtracked from the term ESG because it had been politicized and means something different to every person.
BlackRock is focused on meeting individual client demands, climate-friendly or otherwise, he said, adding that investor surveys show that most of its clients globally plan to put more money into decarbonization investments.
To that end, BlackRock is no longer aggressively pushing companies to take action.
The asset manager voted "Yes" on about 9% of shareholder resolutions involving environmental or social issues in 2023, down from about 40% in 2021, according to ShareAction, a climate-advocacy group. BlackRock cited a rise in overreaching proposals lacking economic merit and companies' progress on climate-related disclosures.
BlackRock is trying to get back in the good graces of red states. The company hired a global head of corporate affairs with experience working for Republicans in Congress.
Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican who had been a vocal critic, shared a stage with Fink and declared him "king of Wall Street" at a February power-grid investment summit in Houston. Fink told attendees he could help Texas raise $10 billion in private capital to strengthen its power grid.
BlackRock's diversified infrastructure fund also recently announced a $550 million investment in Occidental Petroleum's first big plant capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air in Texas.
Beyond that, BlackRock joined JPMorgan Chase and State Street in February in backing away from the Climate Action 100+, a coalition of fund managers pushing companies to address climate issues. A spokesman said that the group's new strategy raises legal considerations in the U.S.
"ESG is unquestionably in a death spiral," said Terrence Keeley, who ran BlackRock's official institutions group until 2022 and has since published a book criticizing ESG investing. "BlackRock is logically prioritizing decarbonization because it is a win-win-win. Good for the environment, good for investors and good for BlackRock shareholders."

Full text: It is a golden age for politicians in their golden years -- and not just in the U.S.
A decade ago, just one of the world's 10 most populous countries, India, had a leader who was 70 or older. Today, eight of them do, putting at least half the global population in the hands of people in their 70s and 80s.
The two countries that don't -- Indonesia and Pakistan -- are also poised to have septuagenarians at the helm after elections this month.
The corridors of power looked significantly less gray in February 2014. Barack Obama, at the relatively spry age of 52, occupied the White House. China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin were in their early 60s. Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico was a youthful 47.
What is behind the boom in boomer presidents and prime ministers? A multitude of reasons.
Autocrats have deepened their grip on power. Xi began a norm-breaking third term as Communist Party chief in 2022, when he was 69 years old. Putin, who rose to the pinnacle of authority in Russia when he was 47, remains there nearly 25 years later, sweeping away resistance to his rule. One of his staunchest challengers, Alexei Navalny, died in prison this month at 47.
Barriers to entry have also grown in democracies, where winning elections requires ever-larger pots of money, giving established politicians with well-oiled donor networks the upper hand. India's Narendra Modi is widely expected to cruise to a third term this year at 73. Sheikh Hasina, 76, won an unprecedented fifth term as prime minister of Bangladesh in January and, after cracking down on the opposition, is in her 16th consecutive year in office.
In mid-February, Indonesia catapulted a 72-year-old member of the entrenched political elite to the top job. He is set to succeed President Joko Widodo, the former furniture maker and small-city mayor whose landmark 2014 election, when he was 53, infused the world's third-largest democracy with new hope.
"Across the world there are many places that have high barriers to entry for new parties and for new politicians, whether they're democratic or not," said Ben Bland, director of the Asia-Pacific program at Chatham House, a U.K. think tank. "It's pretty depressing seeing so few younger leaders and fresh ideas emerge everywhere given the scale of challenges we're facing and the pace at which our world is changing."
In America, the question of "How old is too old?" is looming over the presidential election. Most voters say they would prefer a president below 70 years of age, according to a 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center. Many are concerned that poor health could be a stumbling block for 81-year-old President Biden or 77-year-old Donald Trump.
Europe, whose population is older than the U.S., is bucking the trend of senior leaders. Its parliamentary democracies allow more room for younger politicians to find their feet, like Italy's right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who became her country's first female leader in 2022 when she was 45. President Volodymyr Zelensky, leading Ukraine's war effort, is 46.
Older leaders cast their advanced age as an asset at a time when the two wars in Ukraine and Gaza and great-power rivalry between the U.S. and China are changing the world order.
The five-dimensional chess of world diplomacy needs experience, their supporters argue.
On the flip side, many people question if presidents and prime ministers of an older generation can lead a 21st-century world being rapidly redefined by artificial intelligence and climate change.
Political scientists worry young people will disengage from politics if they feel they are stuck with politicians of their grandparents' generation.
Research from Japan and Germany shows that younger municipal leaders tend to direct more spending toward issues that affect the young.
But in many parts of the world, septuagenarians are leading delicate conversations with the youth about topics like the long-term impact of global warming or the need for more babies.
Some older politicians are trying to bridge the age divide. Biden, born during World War II, joined TikTok this month with a video about the Super Bowl captioned "lol hey guys." Prabowo Subianto, the 72-year-old former general who won in Indonesia's mid-February presidential elections, cuddled his cat on Instagram and broke into jigs on the campaign trail that went viral.
Young people should buckle up for more boomer leaders, said Kevin Munger, assistant professor of political science at Pennsylvania State University. "It's going to change when they age out of politics in 10 to 15 years," he said, "but really not before then."

Full text: Climate change is making house insurance more expensive and harder to get. Health insurance could be next, as research shows extreme heat and wildfires are putting more people in the hospital.
Californians exposed to both extreme heat and wildfire smoke on the same day were at greater risk of being hospitalized for cardiorespiratory illnesses, according to a study published earlier this month by researchers at the University of California San Diego. In particular, the study linked higher temperatures to heart attacks and strokes and found that wildfire air pollution increased the risk of cancer and lung problems.
After the hottest year on record and increasingly extreme weather events, health insurers are battling to figure out how climate change is going to affect their business. The companies are building new models to reassess premiums, estimate risk and meet incoming climate reporting standards as coverage costs rise in a warming world.
"Part of the challenge we see with climate is historically we take a backward view to write these [insurance] models," said Brian Kernohan, chief sustainability officer, private markets, at Manulife Investment Management. "Climate change is unique as there is no backward-looking side. So we are trying to predict what will happen in the future, which is much more difficult."
The health impact of climate change is tough to estimate given it can be difficult to differentiate whether a death from a heart attack during extreme heat was caused by the mercury rising or other factors.
Insurers lack historic and sufficiently detailed data to build predictive insurance models, according to Steve Bochanski, U.S. climate risk modeling leader at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. "It's definitely a challenge how you split out the effects of climate change and other factors [on health]."
There is a big opportunity for insurers that get ahead and assess climate change risks in the near term, according to Bochanski.
He added that insurers building models that better incorporate climate risks could adjust their premiums or coverage -- for example, offering parametric policies that pay out on specific weather events.
Health insurers are also looking for other ways to adjust to the trend. Wearable technology such as smartwatches could increase the number of data points available to insurers, Bochanski said. Introducing wellness programs can reduce the risk of poor health as well, he added.
For health insurers, climate risk is a new, more indirect worry, in contrast to home and auto insurers who are already raising rates in response to claims from more frequent climate-related events.
Still, climate risk is a priority for all insurers facing mandatory climate reporting in places such as the European Union, Singapore and Canada. Companies are now being asked to consider and report how climate change is going to affect their business and how they plan to mitigate it.
For example, Canada's financial regulator -- the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions -- introduced legislation last March that will soon require companies to include physical risks from climate change and energy transition risks in their standard financial reporting.
"This [climate reporting] is challenging, but it is beginning to be adopted at pace. And right now, it's the time to get up to speed with new reporting requirements," said Eleanor Reeves, partner at law firm Ashurst. "It's just the beginning of the journey."

Full text: Dumping chemicals in the ocean? Spraying saltwater into clouds? Injecting reflective particles into the sky? Scientists are resorting to once unthinkable techniques to cool the planet because global efforts to check greenhouse gas emissions are failing.
These geoengineering approaches were once considered taboo by scientists and regulators who feared that tinkering with the environment could have unintended consequences. But now researchers are receiving taxpayer funds and private investments to get out of the lab and test these methods outdoors.
The shift reflects growing concern that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions aren't moving fast enough to prevent the destructive effects of heat waves, storms and floods made worse by climate change. Geoengineering isn't a substitute for reducing emissions, according to scientists and business leaders involved in the projects. Rather, it is a way to slow climate warming in the next few years while buying time to switch to a carbon-free economy in the longer term.
Three field experiments are under way in the U.S. and overseas.
This month, researchers aboard a ship off the northeastern coast of Australia near the Whitsunday Islands are spraying a briny mixture through high-pressure nozzles into the air in an attempt to brighten low-altitude clouds that form over the ocean. Scientists hope bigger, brighter clouds will reflect sunlight away from the Earth, shade the ocean surface and cool the waters around the Great Barrier Reef, where warming ocean temperatures have contributed to massive coral die-offs.
The research project, known as marine cloud brightening, is led by Southern Cross University as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program. The program, equivalent to $64.55 million, is funded by the partnership between the Australian government's Reef Trust and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and includes conservation organizations and several academic institutions.
In Israel, a startup called Stardust Solutions has begun testing a system to disperse a cloud of tiny reflective particles about 60,000 feet in altitude, reflecting sunlight away from Earth to cool the atmosphere in a concept known as solar radiation management, or SRM. Yanai Yedvab, Stardust chief executive and a former deputy chief scientist at the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, wouldn't disclose the composition of the proprietary particles.
Yedvab said Stardust has raised $15 million from two investors and has conducted low-level aerial tests using white smoke to simulate the particles' path in the atmosphere. After the company completes indoor safety testing, it intends to conduct a limited outdoor test of the dispersion technology, monitoring devices and particles in the next few months, Yedvab said.
In Massachusetts, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution plan to pour 6,000 gallons of a liquid solution of sodium hydroxide, a component of lye, into the ocean 10 miles south of Martha's Vineyard this summer. They hope the chemical base will act like a big tablet of Tums, lowering the acidity of a patch of surface water and absorbing 20 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, storing it safely in the ocean.
"When you have heartburn, you eat a Tums that dissolves and makes the liquid in your stomach less acidic," said Adam Subhas, an associate scientist at WHOI and the project's principal investigator. "By analogy, we're adding this alkaline material to seawater, and it is letting the ocean take up more CO2 without provoking more ocean acidification. Everything that we're seeing so far is that it is environmentally safe."
The $10 million project is funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, two philanthropies and several private donors, Subhas said. The release of sodium hydroxide, which will require the approval of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is planned for August.
Experiments aimed at cooling the atmosphere by reflecting sunlight away from Earth are an attempt to mimic what happens when a volcano erupts. In 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines spewed sulfur and ash into the upper atmosphere, lowering the Earth's temperature by 0.5 degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit) for an entire year.
But until a few years ago, many scientists opposed human interventions, fearing a slippery slope that would allow society to avoid making tough decisions about reducing emissions and could ultimately backfire.
"It very easily becomes an excuse for not doing all the things that we already can do and that we know will work," said Dan Jorgensen, Denmark's minister for global climate policy. "When we start interfering with nature, we risk it also having many very negative consequences that we cannot control and that we cannot foresee."

Full text: President Biden's 2022 climate law is driving faster-than-expected growth in electric-vehicle purchases and clean-energy projects, doubling the projected cost to taxpayers while potentially accelerating emissions reductions.
The Congressional Budget Office this past week bumped up its projection of the law's climate tax credits through fiscal 2033 by $428 billion, putting an official stamp on what public and private analysts had been saying for the past year. The law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, is expected to spur up to $3 trillion in total public and private investment over the next decade.
The CBO's increase is driven by a flood of clean-energy factory announcements, proposed environmental regulations that would push more buyers to electric vehicles and rules allowing leased electric cars to qualify for generous tax breaks with fewer restrictions.
When enacted, the IRA was expected to include $271 billion in tax breaks over a decade, though that can't be compared directly to the $428 billion increase. The CBO said this past week that the IRA's budgetary effects are still highly uncertain.
The tax credits' popularity and cost could fuel concerns about rising government budget deficits and make the energy incentives a target for some Republicans if they take full control of Congress and the White House next year.
But many analysts think it will be difficult for lawmakers to repeal subsidies that are popular among a swath of businesses including fossil-fuel, manufacturing and transportation companies. The subsidies are designed to increase energy security and have been boosting job creation, particularly in Republican districts.
"These dollars will soon be flowing quickly out the door to projects and factories across the U.S., with a really strong concentration in red states," said Eric Scheriff, who leads energy and sustainability advising at Capstone, a Washington-based firm that tracks regulatory and legislative issues. "That's going to do a lot in terms of members supporting keeping these credits around."
Proponents of the law, which passed without any Republican votes, argue that the higher expenses are worth it because they will reduce the long-term costs associated with climate change and extreme weather, including major storms, droughts and wildfires.
Companies announced more than $100 billion in clean-energy manufacturing facilities in the year after the law passed.
"The Inflation Reduction Act is bringing billions in private-sector capital off the sidelines to invest in America," said White House spokesman Michael Kikukawa, who said the law's other provisions, including expanded tax enforcement, mean it will reduce budget deficits in the long run.
One potential risk is that some companies will try to abuse the system or reap benefits without changing their behavior. Critics say much of the money for wind and solar-power projects is subsidizing investment that would have happened anyway.
"It's not like there was no interest in wind, solar, offshore wind. There was, and we had some existing credits. They just put them on steroids," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former CBO director who now runs the conservative American Action Forum.
When Congress passes laws, it asks its official nonpartisan experts -- the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation -- to estimate the fiscal impact.
The task is sometimes relatively easy and accurate, like predicting the cost of a $2,000-per-person stimulus check. The IRA's tax credits were harder to forecast because they required estimates of new industries like clean hydrogen and guesses about consumer behavior while interest rates and prices were rapidly changing.
Tighter rules for products like electric cars and hydrogen as well as project delays could shrink the amount of tax credits claimed in the coming years.
In explaining the revision, the CBO said the biggest change came from the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule to tighten vehicle-emissions standards. That would force automakers to increase EV production, driving more sales that will qualify for tax credits worth up to $7,500.
The impact is even larger than it looks because the CBO only includes half the effects of any proposed rule. If the EPA completes the rule as expected, the CBO would include the other half in its next update.
The rules for leased vehicles created another discrepancy from original forecasts. For purchases, the EV tax credits are limited by the buyer's income and the vehicle's cost and manufacturing location. But those rules don't apply to commercial vehicles.
That commercial-vehicle section was projected to cost just $3.6 billion, but the Treasury Department said leased vehicles can qualify for the open-ended commercial-vehicle credits rather than the restrictive regular credits. EV leasing has since expanded.
A Treasury official said Treasury's leasing rules clearly follow the statute.

Full text: China's rollout of renewable energy is accelerating, its investments in the sector growing so large that international climate watchdogs now expect the country's greenhouse-gas emissions to peak years earlier than anticipated -- possibly as soon as this year.
China installed 217 gigawatts worth of solar power last year, according to new government data. That is more than 500 million solar panels and well above the total installed solar capacity of the U.S. Wind-energy additions were 76 gigawatts, more than the rest of the world combined. That amounted to more than 20,000 new turbines across the country, including the world's largest, planted on towers in the sea off China's east coast.
The low-carbon additions, which also included hydropower and nuclear, were for the first time large enough that their power output could cover the entire annual increase in Chinese electricity demand, analysts say. That suggests that coal-fired generation -- which accounts for 70% of the country' overall emissions for the world's biggest polluter -- is set to decline, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency and Lauri Myllyvirta, the Helsinki-based lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.
China's expanding renewables footprint is shaping the global response to climate change. Its companies are the leading manufacturers of clean-energy technology, from solar panels and wind turbines to electric vehicles. That is stoking concerns in the rest of the industrialized world.
At the same time, analysts and officials say, China's deployment of renewables at home is breathing new life into international climate diplomacy. Its rapid emissions growth long provided fodder for critics who said Beijing wasn't committed to fighting climate change or supporting the Paris accord, the landmark climate agreement that calls for governments to attempt to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial temperatures.
Now, analysts and officials say Beijing's efforts are lending momentum Paris process, which requires governments to draft new emissions plans every five years.
"An early peak would have a lot of symbolic value and send a signal to the world that we've turned a corner," said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, a senior researcher at the Oslo-based Center for International Climate and Environmental Research.
In 2020, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said China would have 1,200 gigawatts of solar- and wind-power capacity by the end of this decade. The China Electricity Council forecast last month that capacity would top 1,300 gigawatts by the end of this year.
Once the emissions peak arrives, some analysts expect a plateau to follow. That is a problem, scientists say, because the world's major emitters must sharply cut global emissions this decade to fulfill the Paris accord.
Climate Action Tracker, a scientific consortium that evaluates governments' emissions plans, rates China's current policies "highly insufficient" to meet the Paris accord goal. The actions and policies of the U.S., where emissions have been falling, were graded "insufficient."
China is still building coal-fired power plants. Beijing has been telling Western officials that the new plants won't be as polluting as they fear. They are replacing older, higher-emitting plants, and will run far below full capacity, largely to maintain electric-grid stability as China generates more of its power from intermittent wind and solar.
The exact timing of China's peak depends on factors such as economic growth and weather in the next few years, analysts say. The adoption of electric vehicles is happening so rapidly that analysts say peak gasoline demand in China was already reached last year.

Full text: From "How throwing soup at the Mona Lisa can help fight climate change" by Shannon Gibson in the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 1:
Protesters threw soup at the Mona Lisa on Sunday in the latest instance of deliberately shocking climate activism. While some consider disruptive antics such as this alienating to the public, research into social movements shows there is strategy behind it. . . . When in-your-face activism takes place at the same time as formal institutional challenges, studies show the combination can help increase awareness of the problem and support for moderate action. Researchers call this the "radical flank effect." It was effective for both the civil rights and feminist movements, and it is evident in other political movements in the U.S. today.
We've seen this in the United Kingdom. After initially disapproving of shocking climate protests, in 2019 London Mayor Sadiq Khan met with Extinction Rebellion, a group known for dramatic actions such as spraying fake blood on the steps of the U.K. treasury. Britain's environment secretary also met with the group, and days later Parliament declared a climate emergency.

Full text: The European Union is coming under pressure to pare back its sweeping plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions amid fierce resistance from farmers as well as demands to boost military spending to counter Russia.
The EU has rolled out a raft of new regulations, taxes and investment programs in recent years that propelled the bloc to the forefront of the global fight to combat climate change. As European governments implement the measures, however, they are colliding with farmers, business groups and politicians who say the climate agenda is out of step with more urgent problems on the continent.
European leaders are soul-searching over how to increase defense and security as the war in Ukraine drags on and the prospect of a second Trump administration looms. Anxieties are running high over the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the crux of European defense.
The war has also fueled higher energy prices -- a flashpoint that triggered a wave of farmer protests in recent weeks as tractors snarled roadways. To end the unrest, Berlin and Paris were forced to take the costly step of delaying planned reductions in diesel-fuel subsidies for farmers.
Now, the European Commission, the bloc's executive body, is facing resistance from member states to a proposal that aims to allocate 10 billion euros, or about $10.7 billion, in fresh money for strategic technologies, including those aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Member states are calling for that funding to be limited to 1.5 billion euros and focused on the defense industry.
Details of the fund, including its size and purpose, still need to be negotiated with the European Parliament, which has called for new funding to increase to 13 billion euros and for climate-related projects to be included.
The pushback is a sign of how political winds are shifting across the continent. National governments are operating under tightened budgets amid fears they aren't doing enough to address tensions over trade and immigration. Those anxieties are fueling support for far-right parties ahead of the European Parliament elections in June.
French President Emmanuel Macron called for a regulatory pause last year, warning that a flood of climate-related red tape risked driving companies to instead invest in China and the U.S. Macron has also been vocal about Europe's need to develop an industrial policy that boosts military spending on homegrown defense contractors and plugs critical holes in weapons supplies.
Wave after wave of farmer protests have forced Brussels to trim some of its agenda.
The commission said Tuesday it was withdrawing a proposed law aimed at sharply curbing the use of pesticides in farming after it was rejected by the European Parliament last year.
The proposal "has become a symbol of polarization," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

Full text: LONDON -- Prince William, the youngest and most high-profile member of the working royals, is now tasked with being the public face of the British monarchy after his father King Charles III's cancer diagnosis.
Polls show the Prince of Wales, 41, is the most popular member of the royal family. Over the years, the prince has built up a reputation of being a steady pair of hands who rarely causes controversy and is an adept practitioner of the House of Windsor's well-tested formula of polite neutrality.
U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Tuesday said the monarch's cancer had been caught early, raising hopes that the king would make a complete recovery and return to public duties in the coming months. Meanwhile, Prince William -- the king's immediate heir -- will gain experience at being the House of Windsor's public face, even if his role is symbolic and his father remains head of state.
The 75-year-old king's diagnosis came less than a year after he was crowned and 17 months after his mother Queen Elizabeth II died, making Charles the oldest British monarch to accede to the throne after a record seven decades in waiting as heir. He has proved surprisingly popular as monarch, developing himself into a grandfather-of-the-nation figure while quietly pushing issues he cares about such as the environment.
While Charles is known for being emotive, William appears to be closer in personality to his more reserved late grandmother Queen Elizabeth. He is married to Catherine, and is seen to be a present father to his three children.
The prince's royal journey has in many ways been forged by repeated regal crises, from the death of his mother Princess Diana in 1997 to a very public fallout with his younger brother Prince Harry. In a sign of how the health crisis could help heal some old wounds, the Duke of Sussex jetted into the U.K. on Tuesday to visit his father at his London residence, Clarence House. The last time Prince Harry publicly met with the king was in 2022.
When the king received his diagnosis last week, William was off duty looking after his wife who had just spent nearly two weeks in hospital after an operation on her abdomen.
William was at Adelaide Cottage, on the Windsor Castle estate, with their children Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5. He was regularly pictured driving himself to visit Catherine in the hospital and had been expected to remain off work until she was well on the way to recovery.
The announcement of the king's ill health saw him rushed back to the royal front line. On Wednesday, he will attend an investiture, where he will be dressed in his Royal Air Force uniform handing out awards and medals to people who have served the nation and their communities. Then, on Wednesday evening, William will attend the annual fundraising gala for the London Air Ambulance.
The heir's return was part of a carefully choreographed announcement by Buckingham Palace about the king's ill health. Charles received the diagnosis last week. He informed his sons and siblings of the diagnosis personally. The palace then informed the prime minister, and other Commonwealth heads of state, and then finally the public. A few hours before the public statement, the heads of various British media outlets, including the BBC, were briefed and given a 6 p.m. local embargo time for the news.
The public was left wondering about the exact prognosis. Some looked to Prince Harry's decision to visit his ill father quickly as a possibly ominous sign that the cancer might be serious. But others were cheered by news from the prime minister that the cancer was caught early as well as the carefully worded statement from the palace saying that the king remains "wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible."
The Prince of Wales fronts a fast-shrinking clan of 11 working royals. William is the youngest of those tasked with representing the crown at hundreds of events each year. More than half of them are now age 75 or more. As a result, William has started experimenting with undertaking fewer events but making them more effective, for instance accompanying a visit with efforts to raise cash for charity. He has also taken on his father's interest in protecting the environment, launching the Earthshot Prize, to fund inventions which can tackle climate change.
The prince followed the well-trodden path of male British royals for much of his life. He went to Eton, completed service with the military and often socialized with aristocrats.
Charles shared his initial diagnosis of an enlarged prostate in January, leading to a rise in appointment requests for prostate checks among British males. But the cancer diagnosis has been far more vague, leading some to worry that the public may start to speculate and assume things might be worse than the palace has said. More mystery surrounds William's wife, who is likely to be recuperating until after Easter. The palace declined to say what her illness was, except that it wasn't cancer-related.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A coalition of business groups sued California to overturn a state law that would require thousands of companies to publicly report their greenhouse-gas emissions.
Signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in October, the law directs companies to calculate and disclose a range of emissions from their own operations, as well as those of their suppliers and customers. Thousands of publicly traded and private firms that do business in California and have at least $1 billion in annual revenue are expected to have to comply.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Farm Bureau Federation filed the lawsuit in a Los Angeles federal court Tuesday alongside four California business groups. They argue the law violates First Amendment protections against compelled speech and that California is attempting to act as a national emissions regulator. "The days of California setting the standard for the rest of the nation are gone," said Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the Chamber's capital-markets group. If California's law is allowed to stand, he said, it could usher in a patchwork of state requirements that could theoretically overlap or even contradict one another.
A spokesman for Newsom said his office is still reviewing the complaint.
California State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who wrote the law, said the groups' lawsuit is baseless and denied their claims that implementing the measure would be costly. "While corporate lobby groups continue to wage an unhinged misinformation campaign against these laws, investors and consumers are being deprived of vital information to navigate our rapidly warming planet," he said.
California's law is the first of its kind in the U.S., but more jurisdictions around the world are asking companies to estimate their greenhouse-gas outputs. The idea often is to help investors and the public discern which companies are acting to address climate change and positioning themselves for a future in which emissions are regulated more tightly.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to complete a proposed rule that would require publicly traded companies to disclose their emissions in securities filings, along with other climate-related information.
In Tuesday's lawsuit, the plaintiffs said California's law would harm people such as Missouri farmer Garrett Hawkins, who raises cattle and sells them into a supply chain that could lead to companies subject to the emissions disclosures.
"My concern, though, as a farmer would be that company X takes steps necessary that they believe to protect their own liability," said Hawkins, who is president of the Missouri Farm Bureau. "So I don't know as a farmer what record-keeping, what technology, what I may have to have."
The plaintiffs' lead attorney in Tuesday's lawsuit is former Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, a conservative lawyer who has focused his career on challenging government regulations. His father was the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Some California business groups had criticized the law when it was being crafted, particularly the requirement for companies to estimate emissions from suppliers and customers.
A number of leading California-based tech companies, including Apple and Salesforce, supported the requirements.

Full text: Exxon Mobil is suing two sustainable-investment firms to block them from putting forward a shareholder proposal that would commit the oil company to further curb its greenhouse-gas emissions and target its customers' emissions.
In a federal lawsuit filed in Texas on Sunday, the Houston-based oil giant said investment firms Arjuna Capital and Follow This became Exxon shareholders only to put forward proposals that would "diminish the company's existing business."
Arjuna submitted a proposal in December asking shareholders to pass resolutions committing Exxon "to go beyond current plans, further accelerating the pace of emission reductions in the medium-term." Follow This joined the proposal the following day, Exxon said.
In a departure from Exxon's current policy, they advise the oil company to target the emissions of its suppliers and customers in addition to its own.
"Defendants are asking Exxon Mobil to change its day-to-day business by altering the mix of -- or even eliminating -- certain of the products that it sells," the oil company said in the lawsuit. Their goal, it alleged, is "to force Exxon Mobil to change the nature of its ordinary business or to go out of business entirely."
Arjuna Capital and Follow This have put forward investor proposals for more than a decade at Exxon and other oil-and-gas companies. Neither firm responded to requests for comment.
The lawsuit comes amid mounting political opposition to some investors' recent emphasis on environmental, social and governance -- or ESG -- issues at public companies. Republican presidential candidates including Vivek Ramaswamy took shots at ESG investing on the campaign trail.
More business leaders are refraining from using the ESG acronym altogether in their public statements. On Wall Street, some firms are closing once-popular ESG funds as interest fades.
Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, Exxon said, a company can exclude a shareholder proposal from its proxy statement if it "deals with a matter relating to the company's ordinary business operations" and if it is substantially the same as previous proposals included in a company's proxy materials within the five prior years and doesn't meet criteria to be resubmitted.
Exxon argued that the proposal was similar to one put forward in 2022 and 2023. Last year, 10.5% of shareholders voted in favor of the proposal, a result that failed to reach a 15% threshold that a proposal needs to be resubmitted.
Last year, efforts by investors to push Exxon and Chevron on climate change fizzled out as shareholders struck down numerous proposals to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and report on climate benchmarks, among other initiatives. Almost all failed to garner more than 25% of the shareholder votes, and some received far less support than similar ones had the year before.
Arjuna and Exxon have a long and contentious history.
Natasha Lamb, an investment adviser at Arjuna, was the first witness in the 2019 trial over a case brought by the New York attorney general against Exxon alleging the oil company had played down the risks of future climate-change regulations to its business. New York State Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager ruled New York's attorney general's office had failed to prove that Exxon misled investors.
Exxon's stance on climate change has evolved over the past 20 years. After years of denial, Exxon acknowledged that burning fossil fuels contributes to climate change in 2006. Internal documents show company executives continued to cast doubt on the severity of climate change for years afterward.
In 2021 Exxon lost a historic proxy fight against investment firm Engine No. 1, which urged the company to prepare for the energy transition and successfully placed three directors on Exxon's board. In recent years, Exxon has launched a business to invest $17 billion over five years in carbon capture, lithium and other low-carbon technologies.
The new lawsuit highlights companies' increasing use of courts -- particularly in the conservative appeals circuit that includes Texas -- to question federal regulators. Last month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce won a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that struck down a recent SEC rule affecting stock buybacks. The chamber sued alongside two Texas business groups to obtain standing in the jurisdiction.
Under normal circumstances, companies that want to exclude shareholder proposals from their proxy statements submit a request to the SEC.
Exxon's move is an unusual attempt to bypass that process as the SEC during the Biden administration has become less inclined to let companies block proposals.
In the lawsuit, Exxon said the shareholder proposal and proxy voting process has become "ripe for abuse by activists."
In 2021, the SEC reversed a Trump-era policy that made it easier for public companies to reject shareholder proposals, which -- though typically nonbinding -- have long been a thorn in the side of executives. The guidance indicated that SEC staff would be more receptive to shareholder proposals regarding issues that have "a broad societal impact" and focus less on an issue's relevance to a particular company.
SEC commissioner Mark Uyeda said the number of ESG shareholder proposals last year were up 52% from 2021.

Full text: SYDNEY -- Firefighters typically bet on cooler and more humid conditions at night to help them contain out-of-control wildfires. But authorities battling a large blaze in an Australian forest in December were caught off guard when it created a firestorm around 11:30 p.m.
Smoke and ash helped to form clouds that led to lightning and threatening winds. Fire crews were warned to pull back from the fire's edge, where they would be safe but could do little to fight the flames. The fire burned for nearly two more weeks, destroying several buildings.
"It really threw us because it was so late at night," said Bron Waters, a superintendent with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service who coordinated firefighting efforts from a command center in a nearby town. "None of the predictions that we received predicted that at all," she said of the firestorm.
Firefighters across the globe, including in the U.S., are concerned that wildfires are burning more actively at night, upending a key assumption that authorities have long relied on. That is putting an additional strain on countries' ability to fight wildfires, which many scientists expect will become larger and more frequent in some places as climate change contributes to longer fire seasons.
Firefighters are trying to adapt and are using drones and aircraft to help fight fires or better track them at night. Researchers are more keenly studying how fires behave at night, as well as whether climate change is weakening what some scientists call the "nighttime barrier" to fire activity.
At stake is not only firefighters' ability to protect people and property, but also their own personal safety. Nighttime firefighting can be dangerous because of reduced visibility and fatigue, increasing the chance that firefighters misjudge how fires are behaving.
Part of the danger at night is that fire crews "may not be quite as vigilant as they could or should be," said Rich Elliott, deputy chief at Kittitas Valley Fire and Rescue in central Washington state, and the chairperson of the wildfire policy committee at the International Association of Fire Chiefs. "They're making this assumption that this is a typical 2 o'clock in the morning fire, it's not going to go anywhere, and then you find it does."
Generally, cooler nighttime temperatures and higher humidity act as a brake on fire by allowing vegetation to recover moisture lost during the heat of the day. Firefighters often use this time to burn vegetation in the fire's path to deprive it of fuel, because those burns are typically easier to control at night. Darkness also gives firefighters an opportunity to rest and reposition assets for the next day -- night shifts usually have fewer firefighters working.
But recent studies show an increase in night fire activity. Hotter and drier nights are pulling moisture from the vegetation, drying plants out and making them more susceptible to burning, some scientists say.
"We have understandably focused largely on daytime and extreme conditions thus far," said Hamish Clarke, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne who studies wildfires. "But firefighter observations, anecdotal reports and improved data sets are helping us to uncover patterns at nighttime."
Many fires in Australia's devastating 2019-2020 fire season surprised authorities by spreading fast at night, and how firefighters here adjust their tactics could inform authorities in other countries.
Researchers analyzing fire-danger index readings for that 2019-2020 season found a record for one spot was set at 2 a.m., not during the late afternoon when the index would more likely peak. One government report pointed out there was limited capacity to fight fires at night and recommended authorities develop an aerial firefighting program that can fly missions then.
Victoria state, which includes Melbourne, has been testing the use of helicopters to waterbomb at night for years, though it has only recently moved beyond being a prototype program, officials say.
Pilots still don't fly a night mission unless they have surveilled the area first during the day. They hope to do that in the future, which would allow air support to be called in quickly if a new fire starts spreading at night.
Firefighters are also exploring whether drones can drop incendiaries to help with burn operations at night. "It's safer than flying people and a crew in a helicopter," said Alen Slijepcevic, deputy chief officer at Victoria's Country Fire Authority.
In neighboring New South Wales state, which includes Sydney, authorities recently purchased a roughly $6 million CH-47 Chinook helicopter that they will outfit with equipment, including a large internal tank, to enable it to fight fires at night. The fire service has trialed smaller helicopters equipped with night-vision gear for waterbomb runs in the dark.
Rob Rogers, commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, said authorities want to try using helicopters to airlift firefighters into fire grounds at night.
"Whether the effectiveness of nighttime work gets challenged by an increase in fire behavior at night, I don't know, but it's still got to be better than just relying on daytime operations," he said.
Some researchers caution that not all fires are expected to be more active at night, and factors other than human-caused climate change can influence a fire's behavior. In a study for California, researchers found that fires caused by downslope winds known as Santa Ana and Diablo events, which often occur at night, are likely to decrease in the future, but that fires associated with hot and dry conditions and weaker winds could increase.
For Greg Mullins, a former fire-agency commissioner in New South Wales who has helped fight wildfires, new tactics might not be enough if nighttime fires keep getting more fierce. He supports investing in early detection methods to prevent fires from spreading.
"It takes away all the traditional tools," Mullins, now a member of the nonprofit Climate Council, said of more intense night fires.
Night fire was a challenge in Australia's Queensland state in October, when wildfires destroyed more than 50 homes near the small town of Tara and forced hundreds of people to evacuate. Police said there was one fire-related death. Australian researchers later used satellite data and found nighttime hot spots in the region were more than five times higher than the average.
Fire officials said the rapid spread at night meant that firefighters didn't have a chance to do consolidation or containment. Joel Gordon, a superintendent with Queensland's Rural Fire Service who was supervising the situation from a roadside command post, said the flames were up to 60 feet high at night and cast a bright red glow for hours.
"It was truly an Armageddon situation," he said.
---
A Surge in Radiative Power
Using satellite data, U.S. Forest Service researchers and others found that one measure of fire activity, called fire radiative power, increased at night by 54% from 2012 to 2020 compared with 2003 to 2011 in the mainland U.S.
The data suggested that increases in nighttime fire activity had outpaced daytime increases -- though differences in how satellite sensors performed during the day and night accounted for some of that result.
Another team of U.S. researchers found that between 1979 and 2020, the annual number of flammable night hours had increased by 110 hours. A satellite record showed that night fires had become about 7% more intense from 2003 to 2020, the study said.
"I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say that it is likely that human-caused climate change is behind this increase in flammable nights," said John Abatzoglou, a professor of climatology at the University of California Merced and a co-author of the study.

Full text: The record global temperatures that spawned heavy rainfall, disastrous floods and raging wildfires in 2023 will likely continue in 2024, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.
The service is the first analysis to declare -- after months of speculation -- that 2023 was the hottest year since record-keeping began in the mid-1800s.
2023's global average temperature, the study found, was 14.98 degrees Celsius, or 58.96 degrees Fahrenheit.
That average was 1.48 degrees C, or 2.66 degrees F, hotter than the preindustrial baseline, creeping ever closer to the 1.5 degrees C threshold the world's nations have agreed to keep warming below to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
"The extremes we have observed over the last few months provide a dramatic testimony of how far we now are from the climate in which our civilization developed," said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus service.
The record temperatures were caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions and by the ocean releasing heat to the atmosphere for the past three years during the La Nina ocean circulation pattern, according to the Copernicus report.
"We had the suppression for three years in a row," said Sarah Kapnick, NOAA's chief scientist. "And then suddenly all this heat was released through these marine heat waves around the world."
Not every storm or heat wave is caused by climate change, and not every city, state or country hit record temperatures in 2023. However, climate scientists say that rising global temperatures increase the likelihood of more periods of heavy rainfall, more heat waves more droughts and more wildfires.
The Copernicus report found that each month from June to December in 2023 was warmer than the same month in any previous year. It is likely that a 12-month period ending in January or February 2024 will exceed 1.5 degrees C above the preindustrial levels, according to the report.
Across the continental U.S., 2023 ranked as the fifth warmest year since records began in 1895, according to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Texas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi and New Hampshire recorded their hottest average year, while Maryland and Florida reached their highest maximum temperatures.
As the temperatures rose in 2023, wildfires fueled by heat and drought drove thousands of people from their homes and spewed harmful smoke hundreds of miles from the flames.
In August, dry weather and strong winds from Hurricane Dora fueled the deadliest U.S. fire in over a century, killing 100 people and destroying much of the historic town of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui.
In Canada, wildfires scorched more than 45 million acres from May to October, above the previous record of 17.5 million acres, according to Canadian government figures. A total of 240,000 residents from nearly 300 communities were evacuated during the wildfire season.
"The warmer the atmosphere, the more efficient the atmosphere is in sucking the moisture out of dead vegetation on the forest floor," said Michael Flannigan, professor of wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia. "The drier the fuel, the easier it is for a fire to start and spread."
Smoke from Canada's wildfires drifted south across the Northeastern U.S. and Midwest this past summer.
Extreme heat fueled fires in northern and central Greece, killing at least 21 people, and burning 312 square miles in late August and early September, the biggest wildfire this century in Europe.
Powerful rain events also created havoc across many parts of the globe.
A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, seeding stronger rain storms, according to Jonathan M. Winter, associate professor of geography at Dartmouth College.
"We have a warmer ocean, so that can give storms more fuel, more water vapor and more liquid to work with" as the ocean water evaporates into the atmosphere, Winter said.
Between Dec. 26, 2022, and Jan. 17, 2023, San Francisco received 17.6 inches of rain, while nearby Oakland set a 23-day rainfall record with 18.3 inches. The storms destroyed homes and businesses and cost the lives of 17 people across California, according to a Jan. 11 statement by Gov. Gavin Newsom.
On April 12, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was drenched with 25 inches of rain, flooding streets and homes and closing the city's airport.
In mid-July, catastrophic flooding occurred across much of Vermont, washing out roads and bridges, putting the capital of Montpelier under several feet of water and damaging thousands of homes and businesses, according to NOAA. The highest 48-hour rainfall total was 9.20 inches in Calais, Vt.
In September, Storm Daniel swept through Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey before hitting northeastern Libya. Al-Bayda, Libya, recorded 16.3 inches of rainfall in 24 hours.
On Dec. 18 and 19, parts of New England, including Maine, received as much as 8 inches of rain that caused severe flooding, damage and power outages and killed five people across the Northeast.
If El Nino, the pattern that causes the eastern Pacific Ocean to warm, continues as expected, global atmospheric temperatures will likely remain well above normal in 2024, according to Kristopher Karnauskas, associate professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Full text: Many companies no longer utter these three letters: E-S-G.
Following years of simmering investor backlash, political pressure and legal threats over environmental, social and governance efforts, a number of business leaders are avoiding the once widely used acronym for such initiatives.
On earnings calls, many chief executives now employ new approaches. Some companies, including Coca-Cola, are rebranding corporate reports and committees, stripping ESG from titles. Advisers are coaching executives on alternative ways to describe their efforts, proposing terms like "responsible business." On Wall Street, meanwhile, some firms are closing once-popular ESG funds as interest fades.
The shift in messaging reflects a reality: "ESG is complicated," said Daryl Brewster, a former Kraft Foods and Nabisco executive who now heads Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose, a nonprofit of more than 200 companies focused on social impact.
The movement to bake accountability into business decisions stretches back centuries; the term ESG gained momentum after the United Nations used it about 20 years ago. Over time, the effort became divisive -- derided by some state officials as "woke capitalism" and criticized by others for putting too much focus on measurement and disclosure requirements.
Many CEOs said they continue to follow sustainability commitments made years ago -- even if they are no longer talking about them as often publicly. A December survey by advisory firm Teneo found that about 8% of CEOs are ramping down their ESG programs; the rest are staying the course but often making changes to how they handle them.
Many leaders are more closely examining disclosures, wanting to avoid regulatory scrutiny or political criticism. In lieu of lofty pronouncements, advisers are telling CEOs to be more precise and to set goals that can be achieved. Saying as little as possible is recommended.
"We've seen a great deal of reframing and adjusting by CEOs in the ESG arena. Not only of what they say, but also where they say it and how they characterize it," said Brad Karp, chair of law firm Paul Weiss who advises a number of CEOs. "Most companies are moving forward operationally with their ESG programs, but not publicly touting them, or describing them in different ways."
When Thomas Buberl, CEO of Paris-based insurer AXA, met with leaders of several companies in the U.S. last year, the executives suggested that he reflect the newfound caution. "I used the abbreviation ESG, and people taught me not to use that word," he said.
ESG became more politicized following a spat in 2022 between Disney and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is currently seeking the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. That opened the door to sharp commentary on ESG efforts broadly by more than a dozen other state officials and a pullback by some asset managers. Investors yanked more than $14 billion from ESG funds in the first nine months of 2023, according to Morningstar.
BlackRock's Larry Fink wrote a letter to investors in 2023 that didn't explicitly reference ESG, after some states pulled money in 2022 over the firm's ESG emphasis. Fidelity last year removed language considering potential ESG impacts from its proxy-review process.
On earnings calls, mentions of ESG rose steadily until 2021 and have declined since, according to a FactSet analysis. In the fourth quarter of 2021, 155 companies in the S&P 500 mentioned ESG initiatives; by the second quarter of 2023, that had fallen to 61 mentions.
Adding to the challenges for companies is that some dimensions of ESG, particularly the social goals, can be difficult to quantify. Corporate diversity programs, often part of an ESG agenda, face new scrutiny following a Supreme Court decision on affirmative action and legal challenges from largely conservative groups.
Executives and their advisers said companies remain more committed to the "E" in ESG, wanting to respond to climate change. Some CEOs say that environmental factors are crucial to their business, one reason many went to Dubai for COP28, the U.N.'s climate conference. Climate change is also likely to be a key theme at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week.
Revathi Advaithi, CEO of Flex, said the manufacturer has 130 factories across the world and there isn't a question of whether they need to operate in a sustainable way.
"It's not as though I got a whole bunch of new investors because we had a sustainability report or we were ESG-focused," she said. "We didn't do it for that purpose . . . We wanted to focus on water reduction, power reduction."
Some of the changes are subtle. At Coca-Cola, the company published a "Business & ESG" report in 2022; in 2023, it was released as the "Business and Sustainability" report. The beverage giant also renamed committees on its board of directors.
The fiercest critics of ESG said they welcome less discussion of it. "If this trend is decreasing, these CEOs must have realized that this puts them at greater legal risk and costs them customers," said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who has pushed back against ESG policies.
What to call such efforts now remains a debate. Brewster's CEO group advises leaders to discuss initiatives in clear language, explaining efforts to cut water use, for example, or to use terms such as "our natural resources." Brewster said he wants more leaders to adopt the phrase "responsible business."
"You can be anti-ESG," Brewster said. But "it's hard to be anti-responsibility."

Full text: After Allstate suffered billions of dollars in losses and failed to get the rate increases it wanted, it resorted to the nuclear option.
The insurance giant threatened last fall to stop renewing auto insurance for customers in three states that hadn't given in to its demands, which would have left those policyholders scrambling for coverage. The states blinked.
In December, New Jersey approved auto rate increases for Allstate averaging 17%, and New York, a 15% hike. Regulators in California are allowing Allstate to boost auto rates by 30%, but still haven't decided on its request for a 40% increase in home-insurance rates after the insurer refused to write new policies.
For many Americans, getting insurance for both their cars and homes has gone from a routine, generally manageable expense to a do-or-die ordeal that can strain household budgets.
Insurers are coming off some of their worst years in history. Catastrophic damage from storms and wildfires is one big reason. The past decade of global natural catastrophes has been the costliest ever. Warmer temperatures have made storms worse and contributed to droughts that have elevated wildfire risk. Too many new homes were built in areas at risk of fire.
As losses mounted, inflation only made matters worse, boosting the cost of repairing or replacing cars or homes.
Climate change also has made it harder for insurers to measure their risks, pushing some to demand even higher premiums to cushion against future losses.
"I have never seen the overall market this bad," said Barry Gilway, a 52-year veteran of the industry who retired in 2023 as head of Florida's Citizens Property Insurance, a state-created insurer of last resort that sells plans to people who can't get coverage elsewhere.
Homeowners and drivers are facing sharply rising premiums, less coverage and fewer, if any, choices of insurer. In some places, the only options are bare bones coverage or none at all. That can make homes worth less and harder to sell, and cars less affordable.
Farmers Insurance Group increased home-insurance rates by more than 23% last year for tens of thousands of policyholders in both Illinois and Texas, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Nationwide Mutual said it won't renew 10,525 home-insurance policies in hurricane-prone areas of North Carolina.
State Farm racked up $13 billion in property-casualty underwriting losses in 2022, its worst ever. Last year, it stopped writing new home-insurance policies in California. The state's regulators last month approved a 20% home-insurance rate increase.
"This is just the worst possible scenario you could think of for consumers," said Timothy Gaspar, head of a Los Angeles-based insurance agency. The mass retreat of insurers from the state means there is nothing to offer people seeking new home or auto insurance, he said.
A Farmers spokeswoman said its rate increases were designed to "better reflect the increased risk and claims costs we continue to face." A Nationwide spokesman said the company was being more selective about where it writes policies in response to inflation and market disruptions.
A State Farm spokesman said the rate increases were driven by increased costs and risk, and that the company continued to look for ways to maintain competitive rates.
Allstate Chief Executive Tom Wilson defended the threat to yank auto coverage in the three states that generated heavy losses. "We can't afford to use shareholder money. . .to support an underpriced product," he said. A company spokesman said the "rate approvals allow us to protect more customers as we work with state regulators to improve insurance availability."
Last summer, Marta Cross, an actress, bought a new home with her musician husband in northeast Los Angeles. Their new neighborhood in the San Rafael Hills, called Mount Washington, has lots of trees but no recent history of wildfires, she said, and no fire-zone warning signs.
Nevertheless, their house purchase almost fell apart when she was unable to get insurance from any private-sector company because of wildfire risk. "It was really hairy," she said. "The seller's agent was in touch every day, saying, 'What's happening with the insurance?'"
She contacted a local mothers' group for advice. "Several moms started to be concerned, saying, wait, does this mean I'm not covered?" Cross recalled. She ended up buying fire coverage with the state's insurer of last resort and a supplemental policy to cover other risks, as required by her mortgage lender.
The combined premiums total more than $4,000 a year. That's around $1,500 more than if she had qualified for a regular home-insurance policy, according to her insurance agent, Nick Ramirez of Goosehead Insurance. "I'm considering forgoing earthquake insurance so I can have fire insurance," Cross said. "And praying."
U.S. property-casualty insurers, who issue home and auto policies, racked up $32.2 billion in net underwriting losses in the first nine months of 2023, $7.6 billion worse than in the same period a year earlier, according to a December report by ratings firm AM Best.
Tough times are nothing new for insurers. They are in the business of predicting the future. When losses are low, companies such as Progressive and Geico -- known to consumers for their ubiquitous ads featuring, respectively, Flo and the gecko -- fight for customers. When disasters hit, they tally their losses and raise prices or cut offerings.
Big profits often follow, leading to complaints from consumers and regulators. Shares of insurers, including Allstate's, already have rebounded in anticipation of higher profits. Nevertheless, the industry's traditional business model is under pressure and, some think, broken.
Insurance premiums have outpaced inflation. Car insurance rates increased 19.2% in the 12 months through November, six times the rise in overall consumer prices, Labor Department data show. It was the 15th consecutive month of double-digit percentage increases in premiums, year-over-year, the longest stretch of such high hikes since the mid-1980s, according to S&P Global.
Simon Edwards drives a 2012 Mazda 5 in his hometown of Las Vegas. The monthly premium of his Geico auto insurance, he said, has shot up 72% in less than a year, from $130 in April to $223 now. "I've been in no accidents, no tickets, been with Geico for many years," he said.
Home insurers have faced premium increases from their own insurers, known as reinsurers. Reinsurance prices for last year were up 30% to 50%, and insurers were forced to take on more risk, said Neil Alldredge, head of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies. Reinsurers, more than almost any other industry, are focused on climate risks.
Prices for coverage can be all over the place, forcing consumers to shop around. Nancy Piel, who lives Lake Forest, Ill., a Chicago suburb, contacted three agents last year after Nationwide increased the cost of insuring her two homes and 2011 minivan to $18,000. According to one agent, Chubb quoted even more: $29,000. She ended up insuring with Cincinnati Insurance for $10,500. The coverages were all very similar, she said. Chubb, which caters to high-net-worth customers, offers services not typically available with mainstream policies.
Not all homeowners have the luxury of getting competing quotes. "We assume people have choices . . . go shop it and you'll find it," said Debbie Mayfield, a Florida state senator, at a hearing last year. "Well, I'll tell you, it's been shopped and you can't find it." Her district includes part of hurricane-prone Brevard County.
Among the factors pushing up the price of auto insurance: Prices of new and used cars, and parts, have risen, more people are driving expensive vehicles, and extreme weather is destroying more cars.
"I've been here 27 years, and we've never increased auto rates in the way we have in the last two years," said Allstate CEO Wilson.
Wilson asked hundreds of his company's agents at a fall event in Orlando how customers were reacting. "I was like, 'How's it going? What are people saying? If I'd said to you three years ago we were going to raise auto prices by 17.5% in one year, you would have thrown me out.'"
The answer he got back, Wilson said, was that "people understand it, they understand that their cars and their houses are worth more money." But, he said, "it's clearly a burden for customers, and we need to figure out what to do about it."
Some consumers are opting to forgo coverage -- if they have a choice. Most mortgage lenders require borrowers to have home insurance. Richard Redmond was quoted $7,500 a year for federal flood insurance for his new home on a barrier island on Florida's east coast. "I chose to forgo the flood policy," he said. "A $7,500 annual fee for $350,000 of coverage makes no sense."
Inflation, higher reinsurance rates and lawsuits are part of doing business for insurers. Climate change is a wild card. When insurers can't quantify a risk, they charge more to cover it, or avoid it completely.
"Climate change will destabilize the global insurance industry," research firm Forrester Research predicted in a fall report. Increasingly extreme weather will make it harder for insurance companies to model and predict exposures, accurately calculate reserves, offer coverage and pay claims, the report said. As a result, Forrester forecast, "more insurers will leave markets besides the high-stakes states like California, Florida, and Louisiana."
Allstate CEO Wilson said: "There will be insurance deserts."
Insurance deserts, where private-sector companies no longer will sell regular home-insurance policies, are already developing in high-risk areas. Florida's insurer of last resort is now the main provider of home coverage in that state.
In California's wildfire-prone San Bernardino County, insurers in 2021 refused to renew 1,355 policies in a zip code that abuts Lake Arrowhead, north of San Bernardino, up sharply from 157 refusals in 2015, according to an analysis by research firm First Street Foundation.
In November, Chaucer Group, a London-based reinsurer, named several regions once considered low risk for wildfires that it said are "quickly becoming areas of concern for catastrophic wildfire insurance losses." They include mountainous areas between Salt Lake City and Denver, and the Appalachian Mountains from Tennessee to New York.
Another concern is Texas, partly because of increased development on the fringes of metropolitan areas stemming from migration from California, the report said.
Insurers say they won't completely abandon risky areas. "I don't think it's like the insurance industry said, we're done here, you're on your own," said Allstate's Wilson. "It's just, there are certain places where if we can't spread the cost appropriately and we can't price it, then we shouldn't do it."
Insurance agents and analysts said many insurers are "quiet quitting" high-risk areas rather than face the public relations or regulatory fallout from an official exit.
"Most of the carriers have just flat out said, we are not accepting new business right now [in California]. But that statement is made to insurance agencies, not the public," said Gaspar, the Los Angeles agency head. "Or they're making it next to impossible to get a new policy."
Companies are choking off new business by slashing advertising, closing sales offices or erecting barriers to getting quotes.
Geico in 2022 closed all its sales offices in California. Search for an agent on the Geico website, and the alphabetical list of states skips straight from Arkansas to Colorado. California appears not to exist. A Geico spokesman said customers still have the option to buy its policies in California directly from the company.
Agents say another common technique for restricting unprofitable growth is insisting on hard-to-locate paperwork upfront. Proof that the plumbing's been updated, say, or documentation of work done on the roof. "It's a way to say, we don't want the business," said Gaspar.
For years, state regulations kept insurance relatively cheap in California. Insurers usually requested rate increases of less than 7% because of a 35-year-old law that made it harder to raise rates by more.
That 7% norm appears to be a thing of the past. State Farm and others stopped selling new home insurance in the state. "For many Californians, this is an insurance emergency," state insurance commissioner Ricardo Lara told state legislators in December.
The state regulator granted ASI Select Insurance, owned by Progressive, a 25% average home-insurance rate increase last August, affecting more than 40,000 policyholders, state filings show.
Last fall, Lara said he would accede to a longstanding industry demand to allow rate increases to reflect predicted future losses from wildfires, rather than historic damages only. The regulator also said he would consider allowing companies to pass reinsurance cost increases through to policyholders.
Despite some concessions from regulators, insurers are bracing for a tough future. Allstate's Wilson said that everywhere in the country is at some risk from increasingly severe weather. "There is no place that's safe," he said, "and no place that's not going to be impacted."

Full text: BRIDGEPORT, Texas -- A shale driller is out to prove that it is possible to go completely green -- while still producing natural gas.
Denver-based BKV says that by the 2030s it will store millions of tons of climate-warming carbon dioxide in wells deep underground to eliminate or offset all of the emissions generated from manufacturing and using its gas.
The idea is that consumers can buy that gas and use it without contributing to climate change, says Christopher Kalnin, BKV's chief executive: "We called it . . . guilt-free energy."
BKV isn't alone. Companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron are pouring billions of dollars into businesses aimed at capturing and storing carbon emissions -- arguing that such efforts go a long way toward neutralizing the greenhouse gases generated by their products.
At the recent United Nations climate summit in Dubai, many oil producers argued that the world will continue consuming fossil fuels for a long time and that abatement techniques are necessary to meet climate goals.
Two years into its own decarbonization plan, BKV is struggling to keep it -- and its business -- on track, suggesting how tough, costly and time-consuming such efforts are likely to be.
During the past year, as gas prices fell and debts from an acquisition piled up, BKV was poised to breach a debt covenant until lenders agreed to waive it. The company paused plans to go public and got a $150 million capital infusion from its parent, a Thai coal conglomerate. BKV has yet to secure funding for a host of new wells it calculates it will need to hit its zero-carbon goals, a price tag that could go as high as a billion dollars.
Kalnin says BKV's carbon plans are still on track and that its financial troubles are bumps in the road as it has rewritten loan covenants. The company was profitable during the first half of 2023, public filings show. Things will improve when gas prices rise and government subsidies kick in, Kalnin says.
"Are we squeezed cashwise because of trying to grow a business when gas drops to $2.60? Yeah," says Kalnin, referring to the price of a million British thermal units. "We spent over $60 million building out our carbon-capture business in a declining gas-price market. But it shows our commitment to the business."
Skeptics argue that abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage, or CCS, are expensive boondoggles that aren't nearly as effective in reducing emissions as proponents say, and give energy giants an excuse to continue producing fossil fuels.
Overreliance on CCS to counteract fossil-fuel emissions is dangerous, the International Energy Agency warned in a November report, potentially requiring an "inconceivable" 32 billion metric tons of carbon captured at a cost of more than $3.5 trillion a year until 2050 if current oil-and-gas consumption trends continue.
Carbon capture got a boost in the U.S. in 2022, when the renewable-energy and drug-cost law known as the Inflation Reduction Act increased tax credits for the practice, but the economics remain unclear and regulations affecting the industry are still being created. Few companies have committed to projects as aggressively as BKV.
BKV started pumping CO2 into a well in Bridgeport in November -- one of the first such efforts to get off the ground. If all goes well, the company will reap nearly $18 million a year in government subsidies based on the volume of carbon it injects -- an amount Kalnin estimates could cover the cost of the project in three or four years.
On a recent windy afternoon at the well site, Lauren Read, a former Exxon engineer who now heads BKV's CCS business, pointed to a round, white meter with a readout showing how much CO2 is flowing into the ground. "This is the cash register," she said.
BKV has contracted to sell gas as well as blockchain tokens tied to carbon-dioxide reductions to the French utility Engie -- one of the first such deals in the world.
Kalnin, a former McKinsey consultant, crafted the company's decarbonization strategy during the pandemic, as he read through marketplace surveys. Customers were saying: We want three cars, big houses and cheap, abundant power, Kalnin recalls. But they also didn't want to feel bad about the environment.
Kalnin told his staff to crunch the numbers on what it would take to reduce or offset all the emissions associated with both BKV's gas-production operations and the combustion of that gas by its customers -- a target nearly unheard of in the energy industry. That currently totals roughly 15.3 million metric tons of CO2 a year, equivalent to the emissions from the annual energy use of almost two million homes.
The company figured it could eliminate around 7% of that largely by retooling to halt leaks and vents of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, at its 6,000-plus gas wells. BKV is about halfway through that effort now.
For the other 93% of its emissions, mostly associated with the burning of its gas, the company settled on CCS. Kalnin took the plan, which had a price tag of $500 million to $1 billion, to BKV's board, which approved it.
Kalnin started with the easiest project: sequestering the carbon dioxide that is mixed with the natural gas it pumped up from its own wells. That CO2 was being vented into the atmosphere at a processing plant in Bridgeport. Read and her staff designed and drilled the first carbon-sequestration well in 18 months.
At full capacity, the well -- a nearly 2-mile-long, concrete- and steel-lined shaft drilled into a layer of porous rock -- will store CO2 from the processing of roughly half of the company's natural-gas output, around 210,000 metric tons of CO2 a year.
Engie is buying all the emissions reductions associated with that storage, so BKV can't use it to offset the footprint of its own operations. BKV will have to tap other companies' CO2 to store in future wells. That could be more difficult, since those companies are likely to want a share in the CCS subsidies as well as the emissions reductions.

Full text: As the nearly 100,000 attendees at the 28th climate conference settle back into their routines, business leaders have had time to reflect on the event and its impact.
There were important headline outcomes from the official process and some progress on financing the transition. WSJ Pro spoke to several executives about their takeaways from the days spent networking up a storm.
Mars Chief Procurement and Sustainability Officer Barry Parkin
"Our message is that this is perfectly possible with current science and technology. . .and it's also perfectly affordable, so let's get on with it. . .the only number that the planet cares about is the percentage reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across all scopes, nothing left out."
JPMorgan Chase Global Head of Sustainability Heather Zichal:
"We are focused on supporting our clients on their decarbonization journeys and scaling clean energy. As we move forward, we're hopeful this is a turning point for the public and private sectors to work together and realize the collective intent of these agreements."
Amazon.com Vice President, Worldwide Sustainability Kara Hurst:
"There can no longer be silos between industries when it comes to climate action. . . We all need to think long-term while acting with extreme urgency, and the conversation is already moving on from simply talking about investments and the potential they bring, to deploying the available capital and making changes."
SSE Chief Executive Alistair Phillips-Davies:
"Codifying and securing international endorsement for ambitions like these [tripling renewables, transitioning from fossil fuels] is very welcome; however, the challenge now is to deliver the tangible actions needed to make them a reality. . . At COP28 there was no shortage of businesses willing to invest but there was a common frustration at the pace of progress on the ground, and this is something we need to address for all our sakes."
PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer Jim Andrew:
"The COP28 deal sends a pivotal signal to keep 1.5C alive. To make it a reality, there must be follow through on tripling Renewable Electricity capacity. . . Sustainable food systems making it onto the table at COP28 was another major breakthrough, along with the recognition that regenerative agriculture must be part of the solution in combating climate change."
Google Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt:
"Meaningful progress was made such as the commitment to tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. In addition, the launch of the AI Innovation Grand Challenge to support climate action in developing countries is a positive development. However, there is still a lot of work to be done across the public and private sectors in order to facilitate the transition to a decarbonized global economy at the speed and scale required in this decisive decade."
GFG Alliance Global Head of Risk & Sustainability Marian D'Auria:
"Yes we need policy makers at the table, but this will be driven by business activity and economic drivers as much as COP agreements. This COP28 brought together more people than ever before . . . the variety, quality and seniority of people I met who are now working full time on making this happen is leaps and bounds from where we were even two years ago."
Bayer, Consumer Health, Senior Vice President & Global Head of Public Affairs, Science & Sustainability Daniella Foster:
"During COP, billions of dollars were pledged and hundreds of countries signed various declarations. At face value, these are big wins for the world. But we need to make sure these aren't empty promises and hold actors accountable. . . And this goes beyond government. Corporations have a role to play and we need to raise the bar in terms of holding companies accountable for their commitments and actions."

Full text: It seemed like a far-fetched idea not that long ago -- sucking carbon from the sky to prevent it from warming the planet.
Now, companies are spending billions of dollars to make it happen.
Big companies racing to meet their climate goals are striking deals with firms promising to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in coming years. Companies purchased about $1.6 billion in carbon-removal credits in the first 11 months of 2023, according to data provider CDR.fyi. That is up from roughly $333 million during the same period last year.
The investments are accelerating the development of technologies that aren't yet operational on a large scale but could one day help neutralize the emissions companies can't eliminate.
"We're at this really exciting inflection point," said Giana Amador, executive director of the Carbon Removal Alliance, an industry group.
In western Texas, a major carbon-removal plant that is under construction also recently got a $550 million investment from BlackRock. Once it is up and running in 2025, the plant will use fan-like devices roughly the size of tennis courts to pull carbon from the air and bury it underground, a process known as direct-air capture.
The flood of funding is being encouraged by U.S. government grants, tax credits and a federal purchasing program for carbon-removal credits. At the United Nations summit known as COP28, carbon removal was also part of an agreement to transition away from fossil fuels and accelerate efforts to fight climate change.
The technology is considered essential because the world is expected to continue burning fossil fuels for decades even in the most optimistic scenarios. Carbon removal could help neutralize those emissions as well as some of what is already in the atmosphere, but it hasn't been proved at anywhere near the scale that is needed.
The deals announced so far would remove more than 5 million metric tons of carbon -- a far cry from the billions of metric tons a year that need to be removed to limit the worst effects of global warming. Still, the investments are helping lower costs and boosting the chances of scaling up operations more quickly.
BlackRock's investment also signals that Wall Street sees the industry as potentially lucrative.
"We're not doing it to be green," said Mark Florian, the firm's global head of diversified infrastructure.
The world's largest asset manager is backing Occidental Petroleum's first direct-air capture plant, which is expected to remove 500,000 metric tons of emissions annually once it is operational. That is equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 100,000 gasoline-powered cars.
Occidental and Climework, a Europe-based startup, were until recently two of the only notable companies in the sector. But government incentives and growing interest in the sector are boosting startups pursuing new techniques.
Graphyte, which recently signed a deal with American Airlines, uses leftover plant materials like sawdust to absorb carbon and says its process costs $100 a metric ton. That is a fraction of what companies pay for direct-air capture and the holy grail price many executives say makes carbon removal more widely affordable.
Other startups are also hoping to rapidly reduce costs.
Among them is Lithos, which works with farmers to sprinkle volcanic rock dust on crop land; the dust traps carbon when it rains, while also boosting crop yields. The $100 a metric ton price could be in reach by 2030, Chief Executive Mary Yap said.
Lithos recently struck a five-year, $57 million deal with Frontier, an alliance of carbon-removal buyers including Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms.
In Brazil, a startup called Mombak is removing carbon by planting tens of millions of trees in the Amazon rainforest. Microsoft recently agreed to pay Mombak for 1.5 million metric tons of carbon removal, one of the industry's largest deals so far. Such deals are becoming more common, giving companies the backing they need to grow.
"If that market doesn't happen, then carbon removal doesn't happen," said Peter Fernandez, Mombak's CEO.

State Official at Hub of Insurance Crisis --- Lara said climate change was a threat in California, then insurers departed

Full text: When he campaigned to be California's insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara warned about the risk of climate change. Insurers agreed, so they tried to jack up rates and cut back on coverage.
When Lara blocked their rate increases, insurers, including Allstate, State Farm and Farmers Insurance, stopped or restricted new home-insurance business. That put Lara in the middle of the biggest insurance crisis in the country.
"For many Californians, this is an insurance emergency," Lara told state legislators this week.
Insurers have lost billions in California because of wildfires and other climate-related disasters. The state also has some of the strongest rules in the country that protect customers from big rate increases. The two have come into conflict, leaving homeowners in some parts of the state unable to get affordable coverage.
With his pledge to "defend all Californians from the threat of climate change" seemingly in tatters, the 49-year-old regulator is trying to make deals to bring insurers back to the state.
"This is a no-win situation -- it's a question of what Lara is willing to settle for," said Ellen Carney, an insurance analyst at research firm Forrester Research. "I would hate to be a state regulator."
"Making insurance more available is becoming critical for our entire economy," Lara said at a fall news conference. He declined to comment for this article.
Lara faces a make-or-break year as he races to woo back the insurers. His approach could influence other state regulators wrestling with their own insurance no-go areas.
His plan would require insurers to write a number of policies in "distressed" fire-prone areas. In return, insurers would get much of their wish list, including a promise of faster decisions on rate requests.
Lara's fight with insurers was driven in part by the Golden State's tough consumer-protection laws. Insurers need state approval for rate increases, and increases of 7% or more can require a public hearing. That can add delays and costs for insurers.
Many are now seeking far bigger increases to home-insurance rates. Allstate, for example, is asking for a 40% hike. State Farm has requested a 28% increase.
Another reason insurers have left is that California is the only state that doesn't allow them to use catastrophe models that predict future losses in setting home-insurance rates. And it doesn't let them pass through the cost of reinsurance, which is insurance bought by insurers to limit their risks. Premiums have been surging amid climate-related losses.
Under Lara's plan, insurers will be able to base their rates on predicted future losses, rather than only relying on the past. Lara said his officials also are looking at how to allow insurance companies to pass the cost of buying reinsurance through to policyholders. Lara said he had changed his mind on wildfire forecasts because "we can no longer rely on historical data."
Consumer advocates are worried. They fear insurers will use a "black box" of opaque algorithms, forecasting future fire losses, to send rates skyrocketing. "Lara [has] pretty much decided to coddle the insurance industry at the expense of the public," said Harvey Rosenfield, the founder of Consumer Watchdog.
The insurance commissioner has hit back at Rosenfield's group, saying it makes millions of dollars in fees from the current rates-approval system. The state's rules allow consumer representatives to intervene in rate decisions, and to be compensated for the cost of this advocacy. "Throwing bombs is easy," Lara said at the fall news conference. "Bombastic statements from entrenched interest groups [do] not benefit anyone."
Lara last week warned rates are set to rise. "Will Californians see increased insurance costs in the future? The only realistic answer is yes," he said. "Increasing availability of insurance is how we will protect affordability."
The lack of insurance in some areas has led homeowners to buy bare-bones policies from the California Fair Plan, the state's insurer of last resort. The number of policies in the plan has more than doubled since 2018.
Insurers have been noncommittal on Lara's plan. "I really don't think there are enough details available to evaluate. . .whether it's a net positive or not and what actions to take as a result," Michael Klein, head of personal insurance at Travelers, said on an earnings call in the fall.
Many in the industry privately blame Lara for keeping rates too low for too long, saying the crisis illustrates the downside of having a regulator beholden to voters. California is one of 12 states where the insurance commissioner is elected rather than appointed.
"[Lara's] political calculus was that people want insurance rates to be low. . .the reality is, what consumers really want is insurance to be available to them," said Neil Alldredge, chief executive of industry body the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies.
Lara was seen as a rising political star when he campaigned to be insurance commissioner after serving in the state legislature. The son of undocumented Mexican immigrants, Lara became California's first openly gay statewide elected official when he took office in January 2019.
Early in his tenure, it emerged Lara had accepted donations from insurance executives, breaking a campaign vow. He also accepted free tickets to a Beyonce concert from a fossil-fuel company. Lara apologized and pledged in future to meet the "highest ethical standards." The bumpy first term led to a tight re-election race in 2022.
Now Lara needs to win over voters anew if he is to gain another office when his current job terms out in 2026. The commissioner is considering a run for lieutenant governor of the state, along with many fellow Californian Democrats.
His successor might find life even harder. The proposed new rules, allowing insurers to set prices according to predicted future catastrophes, will likely take years to translate fully into rates charged to consumers. The plan is "not going to be in full effect until after Lara has termed out," said David McCuan, a political-science professor at Sonoma State University.

Full text: For almost a decade, Tony Sanchez III was the epitome of a shale-boom CEO -- furiously drilling oil wells, piling on debt and hunting with fellow executives near his family's ranch in South Texas.
Then tumbling oil prices and heavy debt helped send his company, Sanchez Energy, into bankruptcy in 2019.
Now Sanchez is starting a second act as a CEO, but not in oil and gas. Instead, like many of his peers, he is joining a new-energy boom -- this one in climate-friendly businesses that range from building solar farms and manufacturing sustainable jet fuel to cleaning up emissions generated from the use of coal, gas or oil.
In the latest sign of the shifting energy landscape, the recent annual United Nations climate summit, for the first time called for a transition away from fossil fuels as well as a tripling of renewable power capacity in order to keep global warming in check.
Sanchez's new company, OneNexus, is offering what he calls life insurance for oil wells -- policies that pay out money needed to shut down and cap wells after they expire. Currently, many struggling oil-and-gas companies abandon their wells without capping them, leading to tens of thousands of so-called orphan wells that leak methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- as well as other toxic fumes.
After the bankruptcy, "I was thinking about what I wanted to do as the next phase [of my career], including getting back into oil and gas," Sanchez says from a Houston office. The opportunities in new-energy businesses looked more enticing, and the prevention of orphan wells was pressing, he says: "I wanted a big problem to solve."
As the world ramps up efforts to curb climate-warming emissions, more oil-and-gas veterans who rode a wave of U.S. shale-boom money in the 2010s are now jumping to a new bonanza in clean energy.
Some executives, such as Sanchez, need new jobs after hundreds of companies failed during oil-and-gas slumps during the past several years. Others are selling assets now that share and fuel prices are higher, amid industrywide consolidation.
In the past, oil-and-gas entrepreneurs who closed one drilling venture often started another. Today, money has gotten tight for many new fossil-fuel projects in the U.S. as the productivity of wells wanes and climate-conscious investors shy away, industry executives say. Although many big fossil-fuel companies are spending billions on acquisitions to increase production, the amount of money private investors are committing to funds that invest in oil-and gas-related assets has roughly halved so far this year versus a recent peak of $102 billion in 2016, according to investment data tracker Preqin.
"The capital available for new oil-and-gas businesses is significantly more discriminating and there's a lot less of it," says Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Houston-based energy investment and advisory firm, Pickering Energy Partners.
Concerns over climate change are also lessening the attractiveness of the oil-and-gas industry. In the U.S., around 235,000 fewer people were employed in activities that pump oil and gas out of the ground early this year than during the shale-boom peak in 2014, a 38% drop, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.
Though the share prices of many renewable companies have suffered lately, green energy continues to attract investment. Private investors put nearly five times as much money into renewable energy this year through November as they did into conventional energy, Preqin found.
Sanchez's current business, OneNexus, is staffed largely by oil-and-gas veterans. But unlike his drilling outfit, the new company has no debt, he says. So far, it has been funded by millions of dollars in personal savings, he says.
OneNexus offers oil producers policies that pay out only when their wells are capped, ensuring the companies have money set aside to do that, says Sanchez. The rates are determined by actuarial models that were adapted from human life-insurance calculations, and the policy is structured to survive even if the oil producer, or OneNexus, goes bankrupt, he says.
Drillers in Texas are legally required to set aside money to cap wells, but the amount is typically far short of what is needed and the number of orphaned wells continues to grow.
It would have been impossible a decade ago to convince oil producers they should buy insurance policies for aging wells, but the growing attention to clean energy is changing things, Sanchez says.
During the past few years, "there has been a change worldwide around ESG, sustainability, transition," he says. "I think that our industry is more ready for it today than it was 15 years ago."
Many former fossil-fuel executives are heading to new-energy businesses where a lot of the funding and excitement is, says Les Csorba, a partner in recruitment firm Heidrick & Struggles who focuses on the energy industry.
"You follow the money," he says, rattling off examples of oil executives who have defected to clean-energy startups. "The capital over the last four or five years has been flowing to new-energy startups."
There is a groundswell of oil-and-gas producers who want to stop what they are doing and get into cleaner-energy businesses, says Martijn Dekker, a 25-year veteran of Shell who last year set up a company that proposes to help owners do just that.
Dekker's firm, ZeroSix, would help shutter marginally producing wells early by selling carbon offsets tied to the amount of emissions they would have generated had they stayed open. More than 30 companies are interested, he says.

Full text: The climate deal at the COP28 conference in Dubai is a promise to revolutionize the global-energy system.
More than 190 governments at the U.N. summit reached an agreement that called for a transition away from fossil fuels and a massive expansion of renewable energy. The text agreed to by governments didn't call for the fossil-fuel "phaseout" sought by many countries. It approaches the problem from another direction by calling for a ramping up of renewables.
Specifically, it seeks a tripling of wind, solar and the like by 2030. Experts who model the energy system say that kind of expansion would eat into consumption of coal, oil and gas, erode greenhouse-gas emissions and limit the damage of climate change.
Hitting the goal would require wholesale changes that can't be agreed to at a U.N. summit. Energy projects in the U.S. and elsewhere already face grid-connection delays, higher financing costs owing to increased interest rates, fights over land use, shortages of trained workers and political opposition.
The commitments announced at COP28 aren't binding. The idea is that countries would decide how collective aims such as tripling renewables should be incorporated into their own climate plans.
Despite the lack of teeth, many experts say this process has nudged countries to raise their ambition since the 2015 Paris climate accord, which required them to regularly update their plans. But world leaders have signed up to something daunting.
"Tripling is a monumental change," said Francesco La Camera, director general of the Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency. "We don't have any structures that fit 100% with the new system that is coming."
His organization promoted the tripling target, which the COP28 hosts embraced. It requires adding about 1 terawatt of renewables annually, hitting 11 terawatts of capacity by 2030. The world added 292 gigawatts in 2022 and looks likely to nearly double that this year, driven by massive growth in China, La Camera said.
As countries build out their renewable business, their incentives will shift away from supporting fossil fuels, or so the logic goes.
For China, the world's biggest emitter, embracing renewables -- while stopping short of swearing off fossil fuels -- offers a way to bolster energy security and ameliorate air pollution, while expanding an important export industry. China is increasingly looking like the Saudi Arabia of renewables, so it is no surprise where its interests lie.
"All the stars are aligned for China on renewables," said Katherine Dixon, head of the Global Energy Transition Policy Centre at consulting firm Bain & Co.
Improving technology is a powerful tailwind. The cost of renewable energy has plummeted. The Rocky Mountain Institute, a research group that advocates for clean energy, said Wednesday that the falling cost of batteries, combined with the current global expansion of battery manufacturing capacity, will allow sectors such as trucking and shipping to use batteries, slashing fossil-fuel demand.
Meanwhile, the world's grid infrastructure isn't ready. Hitting countries' climate goals requires a doubling of annual grid investment to more than $600 billion a year by 2030, as well as adding or refurbishing 80 million kilometers of power lines by 2040, the equivalent of the existing grid, the International Energy Agency said in October.
Funding new infrastructure is especially challenging in developing nations whose budgets have been strained by higher interest rates. The text agreed to in Dubai was light on detail about new funding arrangements to help channel more money to emerging economies.

Full text: DUBAI -- Officials from the United Arab Emirates leading talks at the United Nations climate conference proposed a compromise agreement on Wednesday that calls for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, seeking to bridge differences between big energy-producing nations and countries that want to completely phase out coal, oil and natural gas.
The proposed deal, circulated after all-night talks, calls for "transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner."
It says the shift to clean energy for the global economy should accelerate this decade with the aim of net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.
Scientists say that is crucial to fulfilling the Paris Accord, the landmark climate agreement that calls for governments to attempt to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures.
If approved, the deal would be the first time a United Nations climate agreement has called for governments to cut back on fossil fuels. Big fossil-fuel producers led by Saudi Arabia and fast-growing developing nations such as China and India have historically rebuffed pressure to end use of the fuels.
It remained unclear whether Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing nations would support the agreement. Sultan Al Jaber, chief executive officer of the U.A.E.'s national oil company and president of COP28, proposed the document after consulting with delegates across the U.N. climate conference, which includes more than 190 countries.
The agreement must be supported by all countries for it to be approved.
The U.S., Europe and nations on the front lines of climate change had been calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, but U.A.E. negotiators dropped the idea late in the negotiations. Saudi officials didn't respond to a request for comment.
Environmentalists praised the new language on fossil fuels.
The "text sends a strong signal that world leaders recognize that a sharp turn away from fossil fuels toward clean energy in this critical decade and beyond, aligned with the science, is essential to meet our climate goals," said Rachel Cleetus, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Full text: DUBAI -- Countries pushing for a United Nations agreement to phase out fossil fuels saw their hopes dim Monday as the United Arab Emirates officials who are leading the talks dropped the idea in the final stretch of the climate conference here.
The U.S., Europe and a handful of nations on the front lines of climate change went into the U.N. conference, known as COP28, pushing for an agreement that would mark a turning point in the fight against global warming. Their hopes were buoyed by a draft of the agreement circulated late last week that called for "a phaseout of fossil fuels in line with best available science."
Instead, a new draft by the U.A.E. negotiators says "unabated" fossil-fuel burning -- in which carbon-dioxide emissions aren't captured and stored -- could be replaced by a host of other energy technologies. Those include renewables such as wind and solar, nuclear, hydrogen and fossil-fuel-burning in facilities that can capture and store emissions, the draft says.
Negotiators are now set to debate the new text in talks that are expected to stretch through the night. Countries seeking a phaseout vowed to continue pressing their case. The conference is scheduled to end Tuesday.
The new language is geared to bring on board Saudi Arabia and other big fossil-fuel-producing nations that are adamantly opposed to a phaseout. But in bending to that pressure, negotiators from the U.A.E. risk losing support of dozens of countries that are demanding a phaseout. All of the more than 190 governments must accept U.N. climate agreements for them to be approved.
"What we have seen today is unacceptable," said John Silk, minister of natural resources and commerce of the Marshall Islands. "We will not go silently to our watery graves."
Some of the new text appears close to the U.S.-China agreement that was signed last month in Sunnylands, Calif., and calls for replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy. Some delegates said the Sunnylands agreement might serve as a blueprint for reaching an international consensus for COP28.
But even the Sunnylands agreement showed more ambition than the COP28 draft circulated Monday. The U.S.-China accord calls for all coal, oil and gas to be replaced -- abated or not.
"I need all parties to show even more flexibility to get us to the finish line," said Sultan Al Jaber, the CEO of the U.A.E.'s national oil company, who is also leading the COP28 negotiations. "You know that I want you to deliver the highest ambition on all items, including on fossil-fuel language."
Fossil-fuel producers say carbon capture and storage could allow the world to continue burning fossil fuels, though at lower levels that currently. The Biden administration, Europe and a host of countries say the technology should be deployed only for a few industries where fossil fuels are hard to replace, such as steelmaking. Carbon capture and storage is now used in only a few pilot projects around the world and would need to be massively scaled up to make a dent in global emissions, they say.
"The objective must be to eliminate emissions linked to fossil fuels, and for this carbon capture will not save us," said French energy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher.

Full text: DUBAI -- A crucial round of U.S.-China climate talks was over, but John Kerry wasn't done. As the Chinese motorcade left for the DoubleTree hotel near the airport, the chief U.S. climate negotiator jumped into a car with his Chinese counterpart.
The two men go way back and stayed in touch even when relations between the two countries were frozen. Now they are driving final negotiations at the United Nations climate conference in Dubai.
After 25 years on the diplomatic stage, this will probably be their final performance together. Xie Zhenhua, who suffered a stroke earlier this year, is retiring. Kerry, who turns 80 in the final days of the climate talks, says he isn't retiring, but he would lose his longtime partner.
With negotiations deadlocked, the two men are trying to forge a compromise among nearly 200 countries to reduce fossil fuels. Some, including European nations, are demanding language about phasing out fossil fuels, while Saudi Arabia and others are blocking a deal.
Kerry and Xie are pitching a third way, which is a variation of a U.S.-China agreement reached earlier this year. That deal focused on boosting renewable energy "so as to accelerate the substitution for coal, oil and gas generation."
Beyond this year's conference, the two men are hoping that the relationship they forged over climate change can withstand the ups and downs of U.S.-China diplomacy.
The world's two largest greenhouse-gas emitters approach the situation differently. China places itself among the developing countries that blame climate change on decades of emissions by wealthy countries.
The U.S. has stepped up its efforts to address climate change under the Biden administration, in part to counter China's dominance in green technology. Climate change remains a thorny political issue, hurting the U.S.'s credibility in negotiations, as does its position as one of the world's biggest fossil-fuel producers.
At the current climate conference, both countries have pushed for a deal to cut emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. They both supported efforts to triple renewable energy by 2030, and both agreed to make their next climate goals economywide and include all greenhouse gases by 2035.
A previous agreement hammered out by Kerry and Xie laid the groundwork for the landmark climate accord adopted in Paris in 2015.
A compromise earlier this year by the U.S. and China could help close the rift between developed and developing countries.
At the sprawling grounds of this year's climate conference, the U.S. and China pavilions are across a walkway from one another, making them a hive of activity as negotiators press for deals in the gathering's final days. The two men have talked several times, and Kerry was in the Chinese pavilion Saturday.
Climate negotiations between the two countries haven't been easy. Discussions are frank, "even blunt," said a former participant, adding that "there were definitely some red-faced moments." Kerry is a dogged negotiator with boundless energy, while Xie is even-keeled, with an eye for the absurdities of things, according to people familiar with the discussions.
China has signaled a willingness to maintain continuity with Liu Zhenmin, a veteran Chinese diplomat and fluent English speaker who was involved in negotiations for the Paris agreement. He is set to succeed Xie after the current COP28, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
For Liu and any potential successor to Kerry, it will be difficult to replicate the personal bond between Kerry and Xie, who continued private correspondence even during their governments' geopolitical tensions.
"He's 80 years old, and I'm already 75 years old," said Xie Saturday. "Neither of us will leave this community and this cause. Both of us will continue to make our efforts to bring this process forward."

Full text: DUBAI -- Fossil-fuel producers are fighting an existential battle here in the final stretch of the United Nations climate conference against countries that want to end the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.
Europe and a handful of nations on the front lines of climate change are demanding that a final agreement at the conference, known as COP28, include a phaseout of fossil fuels. One option in a draft of the agreement circulating on Friday evening calls for "a phaseout of fossil fuels in line with best available science."
"I want COP28 to mark the beginning of the end for fossil fuels," Wopke Hoekstra, the European Union's climate commissioner, said Friday.
They are facing off against big oil producers led by Saudi Arabia, and backed by Western oil and gas companies that have sent dozens of executives to the conference to argue against a phaseout.
Some want no mention of reducing fossil-fuel burning in the conclusions of the conference, set to end Tuesday. Others are calling for phasing out fossil-fuel burning in power plants and other facilities that lack equipment for capturing and storing the resulting carbon-dioxide emissions, according to the draft text.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries sent a letter to its members this month rallying them to fight the fossil fuel phaseout at the conference.
"It seems that the undue and disproportionate pressure against fossil fuels may reach a tipping point with irreversible consequences," according to the letter from OPEC's Secretary-General Haitham al-Ghais. "It would be unacceptable that politically motivated campaigns put our people's prosperity and future at risk."
"It is quite a disgusting thing that OPEC countries are pushing against getting the bar where it has to be," said Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Teresa Ribera on Saturday.
An agreement targeting fossil fuels would send a broad signal to the global economy that governments are intent on sharply cutting fossil-fuel consumption. It would still need to be enshrined in national policies and then implemented, an immensely complicated and politically fraught process.
The negotiations have spurred the fossil-fuel industry to assert itself at U.N. climate talks like never before.
Energy executives at COP28, such as Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods, have cast themselves as economic realists, warning that sharp reductions in hydrocarbons would wreak havoc on a global economy that is hardwired with the fuels.

Full text: SINGAPORE -- China became the first country to put the latest evolution in civilian nuclear technology into use, placing it at the cutting edge of atomic power just as climate change is bringing nuclear plants back into vogue.
With soaring global temperatures and concerns about climate change casting a renewed spotlight on nuclear as a low-carbon power source, China said Wednesday that the first fourth-generation nuclear power plant began commercial operation in the eastern province of Shandong following seven days of continuous operation.
Safer and more efficient than a conventional nuclear plant, the new facility consists of two reactors that drive a single steam engine of 210 megawatts, enough to power about 200,000 homes. More than 90% of the technology used in the plant is homegrown, China's National Energy Administration said.
The announcement helps "put China ahead of other countries in terms of nuclear-technology research and development," said Francois Morin, China director of the World Nuclear Association, a London-based industry group.
Many countries soured on nuclear energy after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out power at a Japanese nuclear plant, causing partial meltdowns of three reactors. But atomic power is popular again in many parts of the world, as countries look for emission-free and dependable sources of energy to combat climate change.
Europe launched its largest nuclear reactor this year and Japan is bringing back power stations that were closed after the Fukushima disaster, while companies including NuScale Power and Bill Gates' TerraPower are developing small modular-reactor projects that are less costly to build than existing reactors.
On Saturday, the U.S. and more than 20 other countries announced that they planned to triple nuclear power by 2050.
China briefly paused the construction of nuclear plants after Fukushima, but then doubled down on atomic energy, saying it is safe. It currently operates 55 reactors and accounts for 22 of the 58 reactors under construction, according to the database of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
China's technological lead is significant. Western countries aren't expected to start bringing their own fourth-generation nuclear plants online until the early 2030s, according to the World Nuclear Association's Morin.
Fourth-generation reactors are defined by an international consortium of nuclear countries as having more-effective safety features, more fuel-efficient technology and produce less nuclear waste. The consortium has approved six types, and China is trying to build all of them.
Most of the world's operating nuclear plants were built during the 1970s and '80s and still use second-generation technology.
Construction on China's new plant started in December 2012, and it first generated power in December 2021.
The plant uses a high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor with a pebble-bed module, known as HTR-PM. It uses gas rather than high-pressurized water to cool the reactor, reducing the risk of harmful consequences following accidents. The high levels of heat generated by the reactors can be diverted for use in water desalination, metal smelting and other industrial processes.
A passive safety system shuts down the reactor automatically if there are problems, including power outages. These properties make the HTR-PM more suitable than conventional reactors for inland use near cities and export overseas, said David Fishman, a Shanghai-based senior manager at the energy consulting firm the Lantau Group.

Full text: BUDUDA, Uganda -- On a steep slope dense with coffee and banana plants, farmer Irene Muyama starts each day by carefully checking a 5-inch-wide crack that recently appeared on a path her children take on their way to school. She has packed the family's meager belongings into a pile of handwoven baskets, preparing to move to a new, safer home.
The fertile highlands of Mount Elgon, an extinct volcano straddling Uganda's border with Kenya, have become too dangerous for people to live on and farm, the Ugandan government says. The mountain has long produced some of the world's finest Arabica beans for U.S. brands like Starbucks and Blue Bottle Coffee. But deadly landslides climate scientists say were caused by extreme changes in local rainfall patterns have thrust this mountain -- and the people who live here -- to the center of one of the most divisive battles in climate negotiations.
Since 2010, landslides triggered by destructive and increasingly erratic rains have killed more than 1,000 people on Mount Elgon, according to data from Uganda's Disaster Ministry. In the preceding two decades, 59 residents died in landslides on Mount Elgon, the ministry says. Among those killed in recent years were three of Muyama's relatives, including an aunt who worked as a teacher and was swept away in 2019 along with her classroom and dozens of her students.
The government in November started relocating the first of what it says will be a total of 100,000 residents -- about one-tenth of the population of the four districts that cover the Ugandan side of the mountain -- to areas less prone to landslides.
The Mount Elgon resettlement is the largest climate-linked relocation program in sub-Saharan Africa and one of the biggest globally. The World Bank says 216 million people worldwide, most of them in developing countries, will have to move by 2050 as climate change makes their current homes too wet, too dry or otherwise no longer safe for human habitation.
How to pay for new shelter for people being displaced in countries that historically have contributed little to the greenhouse-gas emissions that drive climate change is one of the central points of discussion at the COP28 Climate Conference in Dubai.
Developing countries, including Uganda, have asked rich nations to double their annual financing of so-called climate-adaptation projects by 2025 from $20 billion in 2019. Thereafter, these countries say they will need tens of billions of dollars more every year to provide new homes for the displaced and build protective infrastructure like dams, irrigation systems or fortified roads that will allow people to stay where they are.
"Poor communities in Uganda are already facing the brunt of climate change," Beatrice Atim Anywar, Uganda's environment minister, said in an interview. "Yet as a country we have limited resources to help them cope."
Last week, international climate negotiators said rich countries would start contributing to a new fund meant to help communities like those around Mount Elgon, that are forced to move or suffer other severe damage because of climate change.
Anywar says her government has raised less than half of the $32 million it needs for resettling the Mount Elgon residents. The first round of relocations is financed in part through a $7.2 million grant from U.S. charity GiveDirectly, which has provided one-time payments of around $1,800 to 4,000 families to help lay the foundation for their new lives.
One of them is Muyama, the farmer worried about an expanding crack in the soil near her house. She is using the money to build a three-bedroom house for herself and her seven children on a small plot of land about 10 miles from her current home.
"I will leave everything behind," Muyama said recently, while sorting through a basket of freshly harvested red coffee beans. "Coffee doesn't grow well where I am going. But I have no choice. I will not risk my life any longer."
During harvest season, Muyama earns about $150 a month selling Arabica beans to local traders, who in turn sell it to agents representing global coffee giants such as Starbucks and trading houses like Volcafe and Sucafina, both based in Switzerland. She hopes to cover part of the lost income from growing green beans, which have much lower margins than coffee.
"I don't know how I will look after my children, without income from my coffee garden," she said.
Starbucks declined to comment. Representatives for Volcafe, Sucafina and California-based Blue Bottle Coffee, which is majority-owned by Nestle, didn't respond to requests for comment.
One of Muyama's neighbors, Joseph Wambede, spent part of his donation from GiveDirectly to buy a motorcycle, which he plans to use to transport customers and goods and help him earn a living once his family moves to their new house. The 28-year-old father of four says the plot of land provided by the government is only about a half acre -- around one-fourth the size of his current fields on Mount Elgon.
The World Bank projects that by 2050, more than 86 million people will be displaced by climate change in sub-Saharan Africa alone. Last year, extreme weather forced a record 2.6 million people in sub-Saharan Africa to leave their homes. Few received the kind of support included in official resettlement programs.
Not everyone on Mount Elgon is eager to abandon the land their families have lived on and cultivated for generations. Augustine Wamala, who heads a small village known as Bulawi, worries that residents will struggle to make a living farming much smaller plots of land and that, with some of the new homes some 200 miles from Mount Elgon, the region's traditions will be lost.
"I buried my parents here," said Wamala, 64. "I don't see any reason to leave."

Full text: In the heart of one of the world's top vegetable-growing regions in California, scientists are on a mission to save ketchup.
Plant breeders at the Woodland, Calif., facility of German pharmaceutical and agriculture giant Bayer are testing whether tomatoes meant for processing into pizza sauces and ketchup can survive on a fraction of their traditional water needs, without sacrificing taste or juiciness.
Using a small set of tweezers, Taylor Anderson carefully removes the part of a tomato plant that allows it to self-pollinate. He extracts pollen from the flower of a second plant and places it on the first, creating a new hybrid.
Anderson, a vegetable breeder at Bayer, leads a team that is mixing and matching tomato varieties that have historically done well under drought conditions or have a stronger root system, aiming to produce varieties capable of growing with 20% or 50% less water.
"We haven't hit the doomsday scenario of just not having enough water to do our basic agricultural needs," said Anderson, "but that day is coming and it's coming soon."
Bayer's tomatoes are one example of how the agriculture industry is trying to stay ahead of a changing climate that could disrupt the food-supply chain and drive up prices for consumers.
Partly it is defense. Droughts and rising temperatures globally have taken a heavy toll on agriculture in recent years, and some scientists and agriculture officials expect a changing climate to make extreme weather events more common.
In California, droughts and severe weather conditions in recent years have wrecked some of the state's most valuable crops, such as tomatoes, almonds and alfalfa. California produces more than 90% of U.S. processing tomatoes, used for sauces and pastes.
That is powering a race among seed companies, where executives say they are harnessing their billion-dollar research and development budgets to create hardier crops. Those efforts include less-water-intensive rice and shorter corn that can handle higher winds, as well as chemicals to battle pests that spread in warmer temperatures.
"There is a unique sense of urgency," said Bayer's head of vegetables R&D, J.D. Rossouw -- -- to stay ahead of the changing climate, and the competition.
At Kraft Heinz, executives said conditions in California have prompted the ketchup maker to consider Washington state for growing tomatoes needed to help produce the seeds for 40% of all tomato products sold in grocery stores worldwide.
"It is very hard right now," said Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Miguel Patricio in an interview. "There's a lack of tomatoes in the world."
It can take companies more than a decade to develop new seed varieties, and there is no guarantee they would be enough to help farmers mitigate the effects of climate change in the long term.
Developing hardier plants is one way to help farmers cope without migrating crops from one growing region to another, which would be excruciatingly difficult or impossible, industry officials say.
Moving crops would require purchasing new equipment that could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, said Jeff Rowe, incoming chief executive of seed and pesticide company Syngenta.
The supply-chain infrastructure and processing plants built around crops such as corn and soybeans in the Midwest would have to completely change, he said.
"Innovation has never been more important," Rowe said.
The industry has already spent years developing drought-resistant corn and soybeans, specifically by focusing on creating stronger root systems.
More resilient plant genetics have been credited by analysts with helping the two largest crops in the U.S. survive hotter and dryer growing conditions in the Midwest this summer.
"The challenge we're facing is the speed at which [climate] is changing," said Wendy Srnic, seed company Corteva's vice president of biotechnology, referencing various issues farmers are facing.
Corteva is working on new corn varieties that can be grown in places that were previously too cold, such as western Canada. Syngenta is developing new pest-resistant cabbage for European farmers meant to stave off insects and diseases once unique to Africa but that have spread north from climate change, the company said.
California farmers are eager for a solution. Jim Beecher produces roughly 160,000 tons of tomatoes a year 45 miles southwest of Fresno, Calif. He said most Americans have probably tasted his tomatoes, which will eventually be turned into ketchup for Kraft Heinz.
Drought the past few years has made it hard for Beecher to make his farm profitable. Some members of his family business have talked about selling the farm, he said.
Planting acreage for processing tomatoes fell more than 20% from 2014 to 2022, largely because of persistent drought in the region, according to the Agriculture Department. If water becomes more scarce, the long-term viability of California tomatoes could be in jeopardy.
"It's been dire," Beecher said, adding that more resilient tomato varieties are one of the few solutions that will keep tomato production in the area viable long term.
Bayer's efforts to improve tomato seeds revolve around traditional plant-breeding techniques, crossing two plants to produce offspring that share the best characteristics of their parents. Over the past few months, Bayer's Anderson observed about 40 new breeds of tomato in hundreds of plots, testing them under different growing conditions, such as 20% or 50% less water. The three or four breeds that perform best will move to the next round of testing in 2024.
So far, Anderson said, the results are promising. The physical appearance of plants weren't markedly different and none had shriveled up and died. If successful, Anderson estimates that based on current testing it is possible the seeds could save California farmers roughly 34 billion gallons of water a year, assuming they are broadly adopted.
He said his team even contemplated ramping up the challenge by testing the tomatoes' performance in places like Yuma, Ariz. Finding the right match of tomato genetics and testing their effectiveness could still take years, Anderson said.

Full text: From Texas to Turkmenistan, global leaders at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai are taking a big swing at cutting methane, a potent greenhouse gas produced by oil and gas drilling, livestock and rotting vegetation. They are using financial incentives combined with strict new regulations to get countries and energy firms on board.
On Saturday, the Biden administration announced a final methane rule for U.S. oil and gas producers, requiring them to plug methane leaks and stop burning excess gas with flares.
The regulations also mandate regular inspections of facilities to make sure the planet-warming compound isn't escaping into the atmosphere.
Administration officials say the methane rule -- which will be phased in over the next two years after two years of contentious debate -- will cool the planet and improve public health. Industry groups say it will put some well owners out of business.
European Union officials used the same playbook, announcing proposed rules in November that would clamp down on methane emissions from production facilities, as well as requiring imports and exports to track and report methane beginning in 2027.
But a carrot of financial incentives will accompany the stick of regulations.
On Saturday, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry announced a $1 billion grant fund to help lower-income nations tighten methane emissions from oil-and-gas operations. Some of the funds will be channeled through the World Bank. The U.S. will work directly with Kazakhstan -- considered a methane "super-emitter" by the International Energy Agency -- and its leaders will join Turkmenistan, Angola, Kenya and Romania in joining Kerry's Global Methane Pledge to curb both leaks and venting of methane by 2030.
Tim Gould, chief energy economist at the International Energy Agency, said there is a widening gap in efforts to control methane between private and state-owned energy firms in developed countries and those in the developing world. Gould and other policy makers want to see more private investment to help narrow that gap.
Investing just 2% of the net income made by the oil and gas industry worldwide in 2022 to reduce methane emissions would be "enough to get us down to where we need to be by the end of this decade," Gould said.
The big wild card is China, the world's largest emitter of methane, mainly from coal mining and agriculture. China has refused to join the U.S.-led Global Methane Pledge initiated by Kerry two years ago.
However, Chinese officials in November agreed to add methane to their 2035 climate action plan.
John Podesta, the senior White House adviser on climate, said the Biden administration's methane push piles pressure on China, another large emitter, to follow suit. "We just need to keep the pressure on," he added.
Also on Saturday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael S. Regan announced methane regulations covering thousands of domestic oil and gas facilities.
For the first time, both new and existing methane sources -- pumps, wells, compressor stations and other related operations -- will be required to comply with the agency's environmental standards.
Methane is an odorless, colorless byproduct of oil and gas drilling operations. Once it reaches the atmosphere, methane is 86 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping the sun's energy.
Since methane breaks down faster than carbon dioxide -- in 12 years rather than a century -- rapid reductions in global methane today would slow the projected increase in global average temperatures by up to 0.1 degree Celsius by 2050, according to an October report by the International Energy Agency.
The EPA estimates the new methane rule will prevent 58 million tons of methane emissions from 2024 to 2038.
The EPA rule will require new wells to cap flares at production facilities that burn gas waste the industry says isn't economical to sell.

Full text: DUBAI -- World leaders gathered for climate talks in this oil-rich corner of the globe amid sharp divisions about how quickly governments need to wean their economies off fossil fuels to prevent the planet from blowing past the Paris accord's temperature targets.
Vice President Kamala Harris was expected to join King Charles III, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, French President Emmanuel Macron and a host of leaders from across the Gulf region Friday at the start of a two-day summit to kick off the United Nations' annual climate talks, known as COP28.
During the next two weeks, negotiators from more than 190 countries are expected to prepare the first-ever "global stocktake," assessing how much progress the world has made in implementing the Paris accord. That landmark climate agreement, signed in 2015, calls for governments to limit warming to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels and attempt to hold it to 1.5 degrees.
A technical analysis for the stocktake published in September was downbeat, saying governments were far from meeting those goals.
The threat of an overheating planet is driving demands from the U.S. and other governments for sharp reductions in fossil-fuel burning. Western officials are calling for a global halt to the construction of coal-burning power plants as they push for the final stocktake to include a call for a "phaseout" of fossil fuels.
Big developing countries such as China, India and Saudi Arabia are expected to resist, saying that poorer nations will need coal, oil and natural gas for decades to power economic growth and provide energy security. Developing countries also say the U.S., Europe and other wealthy countries haven't cut their emissions as promised over the past 20 years. They say developed countries bear responsibility for the brunt of emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age.
"Over the past century, a small section of humanity has indiscriminately exploited nature," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told delegates, adding that all of "humanity is paying the price for this."
Developing countries say wealthy nations must make good on their Paris accord pledge to help poorer economies pay for the transition to cleaner sources of energy and adapt to the effects of climate change. Modi said climate finance commitments need to go from billions to trillions of dollars.
The United Arab Emirates, the summit's host, on Friday said it would make a major investment to that effect. The oil-rich country is injecting $30 billion of capital into a new fund, dubbed Alterra, with a mission to invest in clean energy across the developing world. The fund aims to mobilize $250 billion from other investors by 2030.
Alterra is pledging $6.5 billion -- along with giant investment funds BlackRock, Brookfield and TPG -- to several climate-investment vehicles to start, the U.A.E. said. The initial funds are intended to finance 6,000 megawatts of clean energy in India, including 1,200 megawatts of wind-power capacity by 2025, it said.
The U.A.E.'s investment is notable because it is considered a developing country under the U.N. climate treaties, despite its oil wealth.
The U.S. and Europe say higher-income countries that are considered developing under U.N. climate treaties -- such as China and the Persian Gulf states -- should contribute to the goal. The International Monetary Fund says developing countries need $2 trillion a year starting in 2030 to respond to climate change, with much of that coming from wealthy nations.

Full text: Governments have reached an agreement on the architecture of a United Nations fund to pay for climate-related damage in poor countries, ending a year of contentious talks over where the fund will be located, which countries should benefit and who should finance it.
Negotiators from more than 190 governments approved the deal on Thursday at the start of the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, lending momentum to U.N. talks aimed at speeding up global efforts to prevent the worst effects of global warming.
The fund is the first under the U.N. that will pay for loss and damage, which occurs when rising seas, drought or other effects of climate change are so destructive that communities can no longer adapt. The world's governments agreed to establish the fund at last year's U.N. conference in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Since then, they have been debating the details over how to set it up.
The United Arab Emirates, the host of the summit, said it would contribute $100 million to the fund. Germany also pledged $100 million. The U.K. pledged 20 million pounds, equivalent to around $25 million, and the U.S. committed $17.5 million, the U.A.E. said on Thursday.
A draft text of the agreement says the fund will be managed by the World Bank in Washington during the first four years of its existence but have its own secretariat. The fund's board could choose to make the World Bank the permanent host if the board determines that the fund has sufficient independence from the bank. If not, the board would select a country to host the fund.
The subject dominated the debate for much of the year. Developing countries wanted a completely new fund, separate from existing international institutions that they say are tied down by red tape created by wealthy countries. The U.S. and other developed countries said creating a new bureaucracy would only slow the arrival of funds to poor countries.
The draft agreement urges developed countries to contribute to the fund and encourages other countries to do so. That was a key request from the U.S. and other wealthy nations, which want higher-income countries deemed as developing under the U.N. system -- such as China and the Persian Gulf nations -- to contribute. The agreement also states that the contributions will be voluntary. The U.S. didn't want to promise funds, given opposition from congressional Republicans to sending money abroad to deal with climate damage.
The U.S. in November had objected to the draft agreement, saying the text didn't state clearly enough that the contributions are voluntary. But the Biden administration is now endorsing the agreement, a U.S. diplomat said.
Scientists say global warming is imposing rising costs on economies around the world. Storms have become more powerful. Rising seas are encroaching on coastal communities. Drought is afflicting some countries, while others face flooding because the warming atmosphere can hold more water -- until it is released in torrential downpours.
For some communities, the effects are so severe that they are forced to relocate.
"This is a hard-fought historic agreement," said Avinash Persaud, the climate envoy for Barbados, who helped negotiate the deal. "Money is needed to reconstruct and rehabilitate if we are not to let the climate crisis reverse decades of development in mere moments."
Developed countries want to reserve the funds for poor countries that are on the front lines of climate damage and not wealthier developing countries such as China.

Full text: This year is the hottest on record, and evidence is growing that climate systems are hitting dangerous tipping points. That backdrop is intensifying a fight over the future of fossil fuels that is set to dominate the annual United Nations climate conference over the next two weeks.
New studies have found that several tipping points -- from a collapse of Atlantic Ocean currents to drying of the Amazon rainforest -- could be passed sooner than anticipated, some around the middle of this century. Loss of much of the West Antarctic ice sheet may already be unavoidable. Global temperatures, meanwhile, set record highs this year, the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization said Thursday.
"We are now on the precipice of tipping points -- the point at which events can simply unfold of their own momentum," U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said in a recent speech.
Governments from more than 190 countries are descending on Dubai for the COP28 conference, which opened on Thursday near some of the world's largest oil reserves. The threat of tipping points is driving demands from the U.S. and other governments for sharp reductions in fossil-fuel burning to fulfill the Paris accord, the landmark 2015 climate agreement. Western officials are calling for a global halt to the construction of coal-burning power plants.
Big developing countries such as China, India and Saudi Arabia are expected to resist, saying that poorer nations will need coal, oil and natural gas for decades to power growth and provide energy security.
The U.N. said on Thursday that 2023 is on track to be significantly hotter than the previous records. Through the end of October, the year was about 1.4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, topping the 1.29 degrees reported in 2016. June, July, August, September and October each topped the previous records for the months, and July recorded the highest monthly temperature on record. The Paris agreement calls for governments to limit warming to "well below" 2 degrees since the preindustrial era and attempt to hold it to 1.5 degrees.
Incremental rises in average temperature can greatly affect climate systems. Scientists define a climate tipping point as a relatively small change that produces an effect that is irreversible over long periods, self-propelling and possibly sudden. Triggering one or more tipping points would significantly raise the costs of climate change, scientists and officials say.
The existence of tipping points means that the difference between 1.5 and 1.8 degrees could be enormous, said Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter in the U.K.
"Each 10th of a degree of warming from now on matters, and not all tenths of a degree are necessarily equal," Lenton said. "At some point, there will be a 10th of a degree of warming that passes one or possibly more than one tipping point, which brings abrupt and/or irreversible damages."
Global emissions would need to fall 43% by 2030 compared with 2019 to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. Instead, emissions are still rising.
Western officials say the conference in Dubai offers a chance for governments to agree to speed up their plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.

Full text: Offshore wind turbines are pitting environmentalists against environmentalists -- threatening to impede progress toward an ambitious U.S. goal for such projects.
The Energy Department estimates offshore wind turbines could produce as much as 20% of regional power needs along the densely populated Eastern Seaboard from Florida to Maine by 2050.
To reach that goal, the Biden administration had hoped to green-light 30 gigawatts from utility-scale offshore wind farms by 2030 -- enough to power nine million homes. That now seems wildly ambitious, as billions of dollars in projects have been canceled amid staggering cost overruns, soaring interest rates and supply-chain delays.
Added to these economic woes are persistent environmental concerns, as attested to by some recent federal lawsuits. In September, for example, Cape May County, N.J., and a coalition of regional environmental, fisheries and tourism groups sought to stop development of two utility-scale projects off the New Jersey coast.
The projects have since been canceled by the developer for economic reasons. But the lawsuit neatly summarizes environmentalists' concerns with offshore wind farms in general. It contends that the farms present a dire threat to the endangered Atlantic right whale and sea turtles; that spinning turbines kill birds and interfere with seabird migrations; and that vast fields of turbines will disrupt economically vital commercial fisheries by blocking access to fishing grounds and disturbing bottom habitats critical to species like cod, haddock and lobster.
But environmental groups that support offshore wind, including the National Audubon Society, are rushing to its defense. Beyond the obvious benefit of producing millions of megawatts of carbon-free energy, offshore wind farms, when developed properly, can avoid harming marine species or interfering with commercial fisheries, these groups contend. And some developers are working on technologies that could even go beyond protecting marine life and help it prosper.
"While it takes time to understand and to get it right -- and we're all about that -- we can't put everything on hold for another decade waiting to see what might happen," says Garry George, senior director for climate strategy for the National Audubon Society. "The biggest threat to whales and the world's oceans is climate change."
Whales, in fact, are one focus of concern for the environmentalists fighting offshore wind projects. Two federal lawsuits filed against the Vineyard Wind I project 12 miles off the coast of Nantucket island in Massachusetts have been dismissed, but a group calling itself Nantucket Residents Against Turbines filed an appeal in October. The group contends that federal agencies have ignored new information about the dangers to the right whale, and that unless the project is halted it will send the whale "careening further down the road toward extinction."
One theory is that noise from the high-resolution geophysical surveys used to site turbines interferes with whales' navigation mechanisms, potentially sending them into fatal collisions with ships. Inflaming matters are an unusual number of near-shore whale deaths off the Atlantic coast this year -- at least 14 humpback whales, and an endangered right whale struck by a ship -- that some say are linked to wind-farm surveying and construction.
Vineyard Wind's developers say they have taken abundant precautions to prevent harm to whales. And the industry strongly denies sonar activities are to blame for whale deaths, citing a number of studies by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published in 2022 that found no causation.
Meanwhile, a number of pro-wind groups, among them the Energy and Policy Institute, which calls itself a green energy "watchdog," contend that the whale-death link to offshore wind is being fanned in part by fossil-fuel interests opposed to renewable energy progress.
Some wind-farm developers are going a step further, working on technology that would help actively avoid harm to whales. Off the New York state coast, sophisticated monitors are being deployed to track whale movements during turbine construction so as to avoid collisions with ships and construction machinery.
In the long term, such systems may vastly increase knowledge of whale migration patterns and behavior and help better protect whale populations, says Emily Woglom, executive vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the ocean and its inhabitants.
The industry also is exploring technology to reduce bird deaths from collisions with offshore wind turbines. A technology being tested by Norwegian scientists may soon allow offshore wind turbines everywhere to be equipped with cameras and radar systems that identify approaching flocks of birds -- and slow the speed of the blades to reduce the chances of deadly collisions. Land-based turbines in Wyoming are already equipped with a similar system designed to stave off collisions of bald eagles with turbine blades.
Efforts are also being made to keep wind turbines away from areas where they could endanger wildlife. By the time final decisions for offshore wind-farm leases are made by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, "the high-conflict areas" where collisions with birds are most likely have largely been eliminated as options, says the Audubon Society's George. And even then stakeholders -- the public, fisheries and localized green groups, and others who might be interested -- can voice objections if they feel if some vital issue hasn't been addressed.
"We feel the system is working with adequate safeguards," he says.
Pro-wind environmentalists point to a detailed mitigation agreement in mid-2022 between developers and three environmental groups for the South Fork Wind project as an example of how the industry takes environmental concerns seriously.
South Fork, a joint venture between Danish-based Orsted, the world's largest wind-farm developer, and Eversource Energy, a Connecticut-based regional power supplier, is under construction 35 miles east of New York's Long Island. Its 12 towering turbines will generate about 130 megawatts of power -- enough to power approximately 70,000 Long Island homes -- when it goes into operation early next year.
The agreement with the National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council and Conservation Law Foundation commits the developers and their contractors to "monitoring measures to help ensure right whales are not in close proximity to the construction site during construction activities, implement mitigation to reduce noise during piling, and evaluate other new monitoring technologies."
The developers are testing technologies -- infrared thermal underwater cameras and acoustic sensors, among them -- that can detect and have the potential to track whales and possibly other forms of marine wildlife. Ocean Conservancy's Woglom notes that these and several other technologies are undergoing independent testing by a group called the Regional Wildlife Science Collaborative, a consortium of federal and state agencies, environmental nonprofits, marine scientists and the offshore wind industry.
The collaborative's goal, she says, is to make sure not only that these technologies work but also that they can be standardized and made available to all offshore wind projects going forward.
Policy makers are also pushing their own forms of mitigation. The New York state Energy Research and Development Authority, which oversees the state's wind-development interests, recently added a provision that requires the developer that submits the winning bid for any of its offshore wind projects to add a $10,000 per megawatt fee to be used for marine environmental research.
With the state recently calling for bids on another four gigawatts of new projects in the not-too-distant future, that can potentially raise some $40 million "to do good regional science," says Carl Lobue, a senior marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy who monitors New York state's offshore wind ambitions. The state of Maine is considering a similar fee for future offshore wind projects there.
The Ocean Conservancy was part of a consortium of stakeholders -- green groups, commercial fishermen, tourism officials and local, state and federal government agencies -- that labored over the design, construction and operation of a wind farm off Block Island in Rhode Island for years before it gained approval. It's the only utility-scale offshore wind farm in operation, and wind backers say it proves offshore wind's potential. The day it went live in 2016, power from its five massive turbines began serving 17,000 island homes, replacing five carbon-belching generators.
The Block Island approval process, says Woglom, shows that, if done with care, utility-scale wind can be built "without compromising the environment."
She notes that the Conservancy was formed a half-century ago with the specific mission of protecting whales, and says it wouldn't lend itself to a project unless it felt that adequate protection was being taken. She accepts that industrial-scale development of the oceans -- even for a good cause like climate-change mitigation -- is disconcerting to many people, and states flatly, "We can't kill the ocean to save the land."
But she is confident the careful development of offshore wind will help to save both from climate change.
"We simply can't meet our goals without offshore wind," she says.

Full text: Dubai, a desert city known for private jets, giant yachts and other symbols of carbon-heavy high living, is an awkward location for a conference on climate change. It is hardly a surprise that the man in charge also runs the national oil company.
Hosting the United Nations' annual climate confab -- known as COP28 -- is the latest step in the United Arab Emirates' bid to establish itself as a global power broker. The gambit is drawing attention to the country's Jekyll-and-Hyde energy strategy.
The U.A.E. is preparing to increase production of the oil and gas that made it rich, despite calls for it to cut fossil-fuel use by the thousands of attendees descending on the city for the meeting that begins on Thursday. The country also is pitching itself as a champion of renewable energy.
It says there is no contradiction. The world will need oil and gas for decades, and the U.A.E. says its fuels are the greenest around. It says it uses renewable energy to power some of its oil-and-gas production, and is investing in carbon-capture technology.
This is a hard sell. Climate Action Tracker, a research group, says it is impossible for the U.A.E. to meet its target for cutting emissions if it increases oil production as planned. State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc, last year said it would raise its production capacity to five million barrels a day by 2027, up from four million barrels in 2020. A fraction of its $150 billion investment plan is slated for green projects.
At the center of it all is Sultan al-Jaber, the chief executive of Adnoc, as well as chairman of Masdar, the U.A.E.'s renewable-energy company. He also is running the climate conference, a post that has drawn criticism that he will steer negotiations away from ambitious commitments to end fossil-fuel use.
Leaked briefing notes published by the BBC and the Centre for Climate Reporting this week showed that the COP28 organizing team plans to promote deals for Adnoc and Masdar in meetings ahead of the conference with countries slated to attend. A spokesperson for COP28 said the documents were inaccurate and weren't used in meetings.
Climate-advocacy groups such as Oil Change International are skeptical. Romain Ioualalen, the organization's global-policy lead, said Jaber could use his position at the conference to promote carbon-capture technology, a key part of Adnoc's climate strategy. The technology is untested on a scale that would make a dent in global emissions, though the International Energy Agency says it could do so in the future. At the largest carbon-capture facility in the U.A.E., captured CO2 is used to squeeze more oil from wells.
"His company's investments are being reflected in his approach to the negotiations and what he's pushing as potential outcomes," Ioualalen said.
Jaber has declared that a "phase down" of fossil fuels is inevitable, but sometimes qualifies that by referring to "unabated" fossil fuels -- phrasing widely interpreted as blessing oil and gas that is coupled with carbon capture.

Full text: Nearly 200 nations and business leaders pledged eight years ago to keep Earth from warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius. That goal has proven difficult to meet.
The 1.5 C threshold isn't a random number. It has been embedded in policies that affect how we heat and cool our homes, what kind of cars we drive, and how nearly all businesses operate. But even as the U.S. and many other nations ramp up cleaner renewable solar and wind power, overall emissions of carbon dioxide keep going up. As a result, the Earth's temperature continues to rise, and 2023 is virtually certain to be the warmest on record.
On Thursday, world leaders and companies will convene in Dubai at the COP28 climate summit where negotiators are pushing big nations to make good on promises to slash industrial emissions to keep the Earth from warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius -- about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.
Climate scientists -- supported by research -- chose the number more than a decade ago as a speed limit for rising global temperatures beyond which some effects of climate change start to become irreversible. The number refers to the difference in the average global surface temperature between today and the preindustrial climate of the late 1800s. Today, that difference is about 1.1 degrees C or 2 degrees Fahrenheit.
The 1.5 C goal was initially set as a political target that was backed up by research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, according to Anne Olhoff, co-editor of the United Nations Emissions Gap Report, which was released Nov. 19.
Scientific studies beginning in the 1970s predicted environmental consequences if the atmosphere warmed between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius. In the years since, scientists have used climate models to predict what would happen at various levels of warming.
The 1.5 C target was introduced at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit when a group of small island nations demanded wealthier countries limit warming, fearing catastrophic sea-level rise that would devastate their low-lying countries.
In 2010, the U.N. officially set 1.5 C as a long-term goal for all nations. In 2015, 195 countries signed a pact known as the Paris agreement, to hold temperatures below 2 degrees C and pursue efforts to stay within 1.5 C.
Since Paris, nations have established road maps on how they plan to achieve that goal. These plans include using carbon-free sources of energy, encouraging drivers to buy electric vehicles, and for some industries, capturing and storing carbon-dioxide emissions underground. In 2021, President Biden promised to cut U.S. emissions by 50% over 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve "net-zero emissions" by 2050.
But is 1.5 C still a realistic goal? Several scientists say it is improbable. Recent studies forecast that the 1.5 C threshold will be surpassed on a permanent basis within the next decade. The new U.N. emissions gap report estimates that countries will have to slash carbon emissions by 42% by 2030 to have a chance at keeping within the 1.5 C limit. That seems unrealistic since emissions continue to rise globally by about 1% each year, according to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, an independent consulting firm.
More government regulations won't get the world to meet these climate goals; instead, industry has to see business opportunities for investing in cleaner energy and transportation, said John Christensen, co-author of the U.N. emissions report and director of the U.N. Environment Program's Copenhagen Climate Center.
"This has to be done in a way so it's attractive to the private sector," said Christensen. "There's not going to be enough public money to do this."
Even though the Earth's surface is 70% ocean, land areas have warmed faster, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The ocean helps regulate Earth's climate and has absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat and almost 30% of the excess carbon dioxide caused by human activity, keeping the Earth's surface cooler than it would have been otherwise.
Although some days this year have already surpassed the 1.5 degrees mark, the worst climate effects won't occur unless there is long-term permanent shift in global temperatures, which is projected to occur in the early 2030s, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Synthesis, which was released earlier this year.
During the first nine months of 2023, the daily global average temperature exceeded 1.5 C on 86 days, according to the U.N. emissions report. By adding October and the first two weeks of November, that figure reaches 127 days, according to Copernicus, the European climate service.
While 1.5 C seems like a small number, it represents a significant increase in accumulated heat across the planet. This extra heat is responsible for record temperatures and flooding across parts of the U.S., Europe and Asia this past summer. It has also contributed to marine heat waves.
The rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change is faster than at any time now than in the past several million years, according to Peter Jacobs, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. At the same time, Jacobs said it isn't too late for society to reverse course by cutting emissions.
"The first year that we go above 1.5 C, it isn't like there's no going back," said Jacobs. "You could conceivably warm past 1.5, reduce emissions to zero, and then draw down carbon dioxide somehow, cool off, and maybe still avoid some of those really bad impacts."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden won't attend a United Nations climate summit in Dubai this week, White House officials said, skipping an annual gathering of world leaders focused on addressing global warming.
While the officials didn't say why Biden is expected to miss the summit, known as COP28, other top administration officials, including John Kerry, Biden's special envoy for climate change, will participate.
Officials have said privately for weeks that the president was unlikely to attend the summit this year, but his expected absence has drawn criticism from climate advocates who say his administration hasn't done enough to stress climate policies.
Since taking office, Biden has attended the annual gathering -- first in Glasgow in 2021 and then in Egypt in 2022 -- and used the opportunity to highlight his administration's climate-change agenda. The event this year comes as the administration is grappling with the Israel-Hamas war.
"The president has been very much focused on the conflict between Israel and Hamas," White House national-security council spokesman John Kirby said on Monday when asked about how the war was affecting Biden's other priorities, including the climate summit. "At the same time, he's also working across a range of issues. . . . He's the commander in chief, which means he has global responsibilities and the president is more than capable of handling them on any given day."
The COP28 summit, which is expected to draw leaders from nearly 200 countries and public figures such as Pope Francis, is set to begin on Thursday. On that day, Biden is to attend the National Christmas Tree lighting in Washington and meet with Angolan President Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco, according to a schedule released by the White House. While the schedule didn't include any public events on Friday or Saturday, it noted Biden will attend the 46th Kennedy Center Honors and host a reception on Sunday.
Vice President Kamala Harris is also not expected to attend the gathering, a spokeswoman said.
"The administration looks forward to a robust and productive COP28 where Special Envoy John Kerry, National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi, and Senior Advisor John Podesta, among others, will continue to build on" administration actions to tackle climate change, White House spokesman Angelo Fernandez Hernandez said.
Addressing global warming has been one of the Biden administration's central policies. Last year's climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, is distributing billions of dollars to clean-energy companies, promoting the shift to electric vehicles and supporting the domestic production of rechargeable batteries.
This month, Biden referred to climate change as "the only existential threat to humanity."
Some environmental groups, however, say the administration isn't doing enough. A group of scientists recently sent a letter to Biden urging him to commit to more action on climate.
"There's no question it's unfortunate if the president chooses not to go," said Rachel Cleetus, a climate-policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit advocacy group, which sent the letter. "The United States clearly has a responsibility to step up at COP28."
Officials and business leaders gathering in Dubai will discuss how nations will reach climate goals and debate whether to issue a statement on phasing out fossil fuels.
The summit is also expected to showcase plans by the world's biggest fossil-fuel producers to address climate change. "This is your opportunity to show the world that, in fact, you are central to the solution," the Emirati official leading COP28, Sultan al-Jaber, said at a recent conference of oil-and-gas officials in the United Arab Emirates.
Climate activists have complained that the conference, held this year by one of the world's top crude-oil producers, is providing a platform for the fossil-fuel industry and its claims that it is playing a key role in addressing climate change. Jaber highlights the seeming contradictions that will play out at COP28. He is the chief executive of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., one of the world's biggest crude producers, and the founding chief executive of Abu Dhabi-based renewable-energy firm Masdar.

Full text: Utilities across the U.S. are trying to boost spending to maintain aging natural-gas pipelines. Regulators in some Democratic states seeking to limit gas use are saying not so fast.
Companies including PG&E, Consolidated Edison and Public Service Enterprise Group have proposed investing billions of dollars to bolster their pipeline networks, which will remain in use for years even as more customers use electricity to cook and heat their homes. They say such spending is necessary in part to maintain safety and reliability as they work to shrink their gas systems over time.
But some regulators have balked at the spending proposals as they study whether pipeline additions or replacements will become stranded assets, or facilities that retire before they pay for themselves, potentially creating future financial burdens for utility customers. They are also evaluating concerns that prolonging the life of gas infrastructure will lock in future use of the fuel.
The spending debate is the latest complication to efforts by some Democratic states and cities to ban or restrict the use of natural gas in homes and buildings.
Regulators are pushing utility companies to spend more efficiently in adhering to safety mandates on gas infrastructure while doing more to encourage customers to transition to electricity.
Christine Cummings, ConEd's general manager for project management and customer programs, said the company is now working to determine how much it needs to spend to safely maintain parts of its gas system while accounting for an expected decrease in usage over time.
"It's becoming a more urgent conversation, particularly as we see the increasing impacts of extreme weather and climate change," she said.
Phasing out gas use has become a focus in cities and states working to meet ambitious carbon-reduction targets. Proponents say it is necessary to replace gas fixtures and appliances with electric alternatives to address concerns related to climate change.
Restricting natural gas has run into resistance from homeowners as well as Republicans who argue such measures are costly and overly restrictive.
ConEd last year asked the New York State Public Service Commission for permission to raise rates to collect an additional $503 million in gas revenue this year. The commission instead approved about $187 million in additional revenue, a decision made in part because of concerns about pipelines becoming stranded assets.
A spokesman for the commission said the agency is reviewing plans submitted by each of New York's utility companies to reduce gas-system use. New York in 2019 passed a law targeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
ConEd, which has halted its marketing of new gas hookups, committed to stepping up its efforts to educate customers about electrification as part of its spending agreement. The company also told regulators it would replace fewer miles of leak-prone pipeline than it has in recent years to account for an expected decrease in system use.
PSEG, an electric and gas utility company serving parts of New Jersey, this year sought permission to invest $2.54 billion to replace 1,140 miles of leak-prone pipelines over the next three years.
Regulators instead authorized the company to spend about $900 million over the next two years to replace roughly 400 miles of pipeline and make other system improvements. It deferred a decision on the company's larger spending request.
PSEG declined to comment.
Catherine Klinger, executive director of the New Jersey governor's Office of Climate Action, said the proceeding will take an in-depth look at future gas use, field recommendations from a consultant and develop guidelines for utilities in reducing gas-system emissions.

Full text: As the world prepares to travel to the COP28 climate summit, hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a new report warns that the fossil-fuel industry isn't investing enough in decarbonization.
Despite earning average annual revenues of $3.5 trillion since 2018, oil-and-gas companies are spending just 2.5% of their investment on clean energy, which is about 1% of the global clean-energy spend, according to the International Energy Agency. And 60% of that comes from just four companies out of thousands of producers.
"Clean energy progress will continue with or without oil and gas producers," IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. "However, the journey to net zero emissions will be more costly, and harder to navigate, if the sector is not on board."
The IEA estimated about half of the industry's capital expenditures should go toward clean energy projects by 2030 to be on track for the Paris climate agreement target. The fossil-fuel industry could leverage the skills and resources used for oil-and-gas extraction, processing and transportation to scale up low-emissions fuels and technologies such as hydrogen, liquid biofuels, biomethane and geothermal energy, the organization said.
In addition, cutting emissions from oil-and-gas companies' operations and energy usage is "one of the cheapest options to reduce GHG [greenhouse gases] emissions generally," the IEA said. It estimated producing, transporting and processing oil and gas generate nearly 15% of global energy-related emissions and said tackling methane leaks should be a top priority, as it can be done very cost-effectively and is about half of total operational emissions.
As of today, less than half of oil-and-gas output globally comes from companies that have set targets to reduce emissions from operations, the IEA said. From small independent firms to national majors, the industry needs to scale up efforts to slash the emission intensity of operations, boost production of low-emission fuels and prepare to scale back operations.
The IEA said carbon capture, utilization and storage, known as CCUS, is essential in the energy transition but cautions it isn't a way to retain the status quo. It estimates that would require an "inconceivable" 32 billion metric tons of carbon be captured, requiring more electricity than current global demand and over $3.5 trillion in annual investments from now through 2050.
Overall, clean-energy investment worldwide has increased by 40% since 2020, with a strong focus on technologies such as solar PV, wind power and electric vehicles as governments raise their climate goals and establish policy to support the energy transition.
Total energy investment is estimated at $2.8 trillion in the current year, with around $1.8 trillion on clean energy and $1 trillion on oil, gas and coal. In its net-zero scenario, the IEA forecasts annual fossil fuel investment dropping by $500 billion to 2030 and clean-energy investment increasing by more than $2 trillion.

Full text: Kyle Puchta is up well before dawn most days, poring over weather forecasts that Regions Financial purchases from a private contractor based in Norway. Whenever there is a hurricane, tornado or other disaster coming the bank's way, he sends a 5 a.m. email to prep colleagues on how to get ready.
The 59-year-old Puchta, a senior vice president in corporate security at Regions, is the point man for a unit of 75 employees known inside the bank as the "SWAT Team" or the "Weather Team." The role wasn't intended to focus on weather when Puchta started it in 2011, but he spends at least half of his time on it these days.
"We never have an off time," Puchta said in an interview at the Regions operations center, housed in an office park 15 miles south of the bank headquarters in Birmingham, Ala.
Sometimes, his early-morning emails are the start of swift action: Branches must be boarded up, mobile units and ATMs must be sent to areas where the power went out. The reports also inform the bank's longer-term planning. Executives review them for clues on how natural disasters will affect the balance sheet, now and years in the future.
It is just one piece of the bank's attempt to adjust to a planet where extreme weather is becoming more commonplace. Even when there are no alerts for the weather team to monitor -- and the bank gets thousands each year -- there is a disaster playbook to refine and quarterly weather reports to put together. The possibilities it must consider are numerous: customers whose businesses or properties are destroyed, households that can't get homeowners insurance, havoc in the oil-and-gas industry.
For Chief Executive John Turner preparing for climate change is a matter of math. "We lend money," he said. "And we want to make sure we get paid back."
Regions is an old-school Southern bank, not known for flashy technology or a major presence on Wall Street. Its 1,300 branches run across hurricane country in the Southeast and parts of Tornado Alley in the Midwest, as well as states such as Texas that are prone to all kinds of extreme weather.
Companies of all types are at risk from supercharged heat waves, storms, floods and wildfires. Some are already turning their whole business upside down: the fishermen who switch to kelp farming when the lobsters move north; the burger joint that must keep kitchen employees cool when the air conditioner breaks down in triple-digit heat. Banks, at the very least, will have to make bets on how trillions of dollars in loans will hold up against climate change. They may have to reassess which businesses and households they can afford to do business with and where -- shifts that would ripple through the economy.
Big global banks are taking an expansive approach to the issue of climate change, believing they have an important role in stopping it by redirecting lending and pushing clients to make changes.
Regions is doing more than other banks of its size, but it hasn't exactly reworked its whole business model.
A large part of its approach is simply planning out how loans might go bad or how many branches and ATMs might be destroyed in a storm. Executives said climate-change risks haven't stopped the bank from lending to certain industries, like oil and gas, or in certain places. And the bank hasn't announced a pledge to, for example, become carbon neutral.
But Regions has changed the way it underwrites and monitors loans, executives said. Bankers have to consider how exposed a property is to floods or other disasters before they make a loan, for example, or whether a company has timber tracts or oil fields concentrated in one area.
The bank is also watching how insurance could affect the businesses and households that it banks, since many are finding it much harder and more expensive to get property insurance.
"If you were to ask me what keeps you up at night, it would be real-estate lending and risk on the mortgage side," said Kate Danella, head of consumer banking at Regions.
Big-but-not-huge banks like Regions are already under pressure this year from high interest rates and new capital rules, and several midsize banks collapsed earlier this year. That makes tamping down on risk without cutting into profits more important.
Last month, federal regulators for the first time rolled out rules on how banks with more than $100 billion in assets, including Regions, should prepare for risks related to climate change. The Federal Reserve has asked six of the largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, to go a few steps further by mapping out their ability to handle different climate scenarios.
Some other big regional banks have started to think about how to model climate risk, though those efforts are in early stages. The U.S. banking industry mentioned climate change in at least 800 calls or securities filings in 2022, compared with more than 500 a year earlier, according to Factiva data. In much of the decade before, banks mentioned it on a few dozen calls or filings a year at most.
Mother Nature isn't exactly easy to predict, so preparing for weather-related losses isn't either.
In 2005, for example, Regions initially estimated losses from Hurricane Katrina would be around $70 million, but they turned out to be less than $10 million. Last year, the bank put away $20 million for Hurricane Ian, which hit Florida, then reversed it the next quarter. Having lower-than-expected losses isn't bad, but those reserves drag on profits.
"It's hard to be precise, and that's why we believe that being conservative and hanging up a bigger reserve early on is better for our customers and our shareholders," said Regions Chief Financial Officer David Turner, who isn't related to the CEO. "Just go ahead and take your medicine."
Regions named climate change as a risk factor in its annual filing with securities regulators as early as 2010. The phrase now appears in that filing a dozen times. "You can't not recognize that we are seeing more severe climate-related events," John Turner said.
"Weather-related events, other natural or man-made disasters, climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy pose shorter- and longer-term risks to our business," the bank wrote in its most recent annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, "and are expected to increase over time."

Full text: A pile of government cash from last year's climate law was supposed to fuel a wave of clean-energy startups. Instead, many are running out of money before the funding comes through.
Higher interest rates and rising costs hurt the companies in what are often capital-intensive industries. Washington's grinding bureaucracy has been slow to dole out the cash from the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act.
Instead of minting a generation of startups, the government's climate cash is set to flow to big companies that have better access to funding and moneymaking businesses that can offset costs.
"It's taking longer than the market expected initially for the IRA benefits to kick in," said James West, a senior managing director at investment bank Evercore ISI, who analyzes clean-energy companies. When they do emerge, "they're accruing to companies that are more mature and more established and don't need to raise capital."
Companies such as battery recycler Li-Cycle Holdings, hydrogen upstart Plug Power and small modular nuclear-reactor firm NuScale Power are delaying or canceling projects because of ballooning construction costs and higher interest rates.
Some of the companies are in Catch-22 situations. Washington won't issue them loans until they raise outside money and move ahead with projects. And they typically can't qualify for tax credits until they finish building plants. Tight funding and high costs mean they sometimes can't do either.
A race of sorts has emerged between the impact of higher rates and the funding from 2022's IRA, which provides subsidies and tax credits to address climate change. So far this year, higher rates are winning.
They slowed U.S. renewable-energy installations by driving up costs of wind and solar farms and battery factories. High rates also cut into climate-startup funding and put clean-energy stocks on track for their worst year since 2011.
The disruptions are a challenge for the Biden administration, which wants to take credit for creating jobs and fighting climate change. The administration is confident many announced projects will get built and feels the industry hiccups would be even worse without policies like the climate law, a senior administration official said.
A marquee $400 billion government clean-energy lending program agreed to make loans worth more than $20 billion for 12 companies since Biden took office to bolster domestic industries. But only four of the companies ticked all of the boxes to get the much-needed cash.
Battery-recycling startup Li-Cycle, which still has boxes to tick, is pausing construction on a facility in Rochester, N.Y., due to total costs growing to between $850 million and $1 billion from an originally announced $700 million. That puts its $375 million government-loan agreement in jeopardy.
Li-Cycle is burning through its cash, which fell to $137.4 million at the end of September from $517.9 million at the start of the year. The company is discussing strategic alternatives and financing options with the investment bank Moelis. Its shares trade at about 65 cents, down from $6 in the summer.
"These are the things that can happen when executing big projects," Ajay Kochhar, Li-Cycle's chief executive, said. The company is talking to the Energy Department about how it can get the loan. "If we were part of a larger company, you have a larger whole that absorbs the impact. This is the main show for us," he said.
Many clean-energy companies filed for bankruptcy in recent months, including electric-vehicle makers Proterra and Lordstown Motors and sustainable-farming company AppHarvest. Other upstart electric-car companies, such as Faraday Future, Arrival, Canoo and charging firm Tritium, are in danger of joining the list.
Plug Power was expected to be one of the biggest winners from the climate law. The company is aiming to produce green hydrogen, a potential replacement for fossil fuels in industries like steelmaking. Green hydrogen is eligible for lucrative subsidies, but the company's first plant in Georgia was hit by delays and rising costs.
Earlier this month, Plug Power warned it might go bust in the next year unless it raises additional cash. It is evaluating fundraising options, including a possible $1.5 billion loan agreement with the government, though the timing remains unclear. "I wouldn't be talking to you today if we had that money," CEO Andy Marsh said in an interview. He said he understands why the office is careful with taxpayer dollars.
Plug Power has been battered by surging costs in its existing business of buying hydrogen from other companies and providing fuel cells to customers. Its market value has fallen to about $2.5 billion from nearly $35 billion at a recent peak in 2021, when Marsh sold shares.

Full text: The Texas State Board of Education voted Friday to block science lessons published by eight companies from appearing on an influential statewide list of textbook providers, citing problems with the way they depicted climate change and evolution.
Some of the 15 elected board members raised issues with a book from publisher Discovery Education because it discussed how the U.S. isn't energy independent and lags behind other nations in oil reserves. A biology textbook from McGraw Hill won approval only after the publisher agreed to remove some graphics depicting human and primate evolution.
Board member LJ Francis said Friday he received emails from people in his district demanding "no monkey pushing," and that he wanted "ample clarification that's not what's being taught in Texas schools."
During an initial discussion on the textbooks earlier this week, Republican members of the board expressed a desire for some materials to depict both the scientific theory of evolution and the Bible story of creationism. Others said textbooks cast the oil-and-gas industry in a bad light, which could have negative repercussions on the energy-heavy state's economy.
"There is no evidence that an entirely different species can come from another species," board member Evelyn Brooks said Tuesday during discussion of McGraw Hill's biology textbook. The chairman of the board reminded Brooks that including creationism to appease religious families could be unconstitutional.
A McGraw Hill spokesman said the edits don't compromise the academic integrity of the program and that "evolution continues to be covered appropriately in our titles." Discovery declined to comment.
While school districts in Texas are free to buy any materials they want, appearing on the state-approved list can lead to much broader use.
"They canceled all the folks doing things a little bit new, different, more innovative," said Matthew d'Alessio, science director at Silicon Valley startup Green Ninja, which publishes some of the lessons that the board rejected. "We feel like they've really thrown away a lot of choices for Texas students."
Board member Patricia Hardy took issue with a lesson asking students to write a "climate-fiction" story warning a family or friend about a future extreme weather event in their hometown. "This is taking a position that all that is settled science, and that our extreme weather is caused by climate change," Hardy said.
Story prompts in the Green Ninja lesson include, "What might happen in your story if your characters live through five years of drought?" and "What might happen in your story if your characters couldn't go outside for a few days due to smoke from a forest fire?"
Several board members pushed back this week on lessons they viewed as casting the oil-and-gas industry negatively and promoting renewable energy.
"There are theories about fossil fuels, there are not agreed-upon facts," board member Julie Pickren said Tuesday when discussing fifth-grade science materials from Savvas Learning Co. The materials, she said, depicted an anti-fossil-fuel position that "would have a detriment to the Texas GDP, the Texas economy, considering the amount of our GDP that is related to fossil fuels and the amount of our workforce."
The discussion this week alarmed the Texas Freedom Network, an advocacy organization that works to fight textbook censorship, said spokeswoman Emily Witt. "Talk of what's best for kids was really missing from that meeting," Witt said of Tuesday's meeting.
The board voted Friday to put Savvas's science materials on the state list, along with those from 13 other companies.

Full text: One of the world's biggest exporters of fossil fuels, the United Arab Emirates, is attempting to position itself as a leader in establishing global carbon markets as it prepares to host annual United Nations climate talks this month.
Those efforts are coming under scrutiny as a company owned by one of the U.A.E.'s royal families prepares to secure rights to produce carbon credits from a vast expanse of African forest.
The climate negotiations this month seek to agree on rules for a global market where carbon credits can be purchased to compensate for emissions that contribute to global warming. The idea is to create an incentive to cut emissions.
But many environmentalists allege some carbon-credit projects overstate emissions reductions and that the purchase of credits simply give cover to continue polluting.
Blue Carbon, a private company owned by Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum, a member of the ruling family of Dubai, signed preliminary pacts this year with five African nations -- Liberia, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya. The deals would grant it the sole right to develop and sell carbon credits from more than 60 million acres of forest.
Climate campaigners are warning that these types of agreements could influence how negotiations play out at this year's U.N. climate talks and, ultimately, make the rules for global carbon markets less effective at reducing emissions. At stake is agreeing on regulations that build trust in the market, with credits representing genuine reductions.
Blue Carbon's draft contract with Liberia, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, shows how lucrative the deals could potentially be -- both for the company and the African nations.
The deal with Liberia could cover 2.5 million acres of forest -- 10% of the nation's land -- for the next 30 years, according to the draft. For the first 10 years, Blue Carbon would get 70% of the proceeds when credits are sold, with 30% going to the government. After that, there would be a 50-50 division. Those splits are unusually high in favor of the company, environmentalists said.
The draft contract doesn't mention any upfront payment to Liberia. The company said its deals were based on "benefit-sharing arrangements," but declined to discuss details of its contracts. Blue Carbon said it hadn't reached a final deal on income distribution.
Blue Carbon's deal with Zimbabwe is even larger, covering 19 million acres, which is about 20% of its total land.
The concern among environmentalists is that the African forest deals could give the U.A.E. an incentive to push for more-lenient rules during the U.N. climate talks, allowing it to generate more credits. The countries also would have an incentive to generate more money from the deals.
"The main concern with all these deals is that it allows U.A.E. to continue emitting CO2 by buying dubious carbon credits, while undermining the possibility of these African countries meeting their own reduction commitments," said Saskia Ozinga, founder of Fern, a European forest-advocacy group, referring to African nations using the credits to meet their own climate goals.
The U.A.E.'s Ministry of Climate Change and Environment declined to comment on the potential outcome of the talks.
Liberian regulators are working on a legal framework for the country's carbon assets, said Wilson Tarpeh, executive director of Liberia's Environmental Protection Agency. Zimbabwe's environment minister, Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, also said the country is working on a framework that would be transparent and benefit communities in the affected areas.
---
Some Question the Value of Forest-Offsetting Accords
Kate Dooley, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne's Climate and Energy College, said that if the United Nations climate talks this month lead to allowing avoided emissions to qualify for carbon credits, that potentially would make the rights of Blue Carbon -- a company owned by one of the U.A.E.'s royal families -- to harvest credits much more valuable, but would be a setback for global climate goals.
The world needs a significant absolute reduction in emissions by 2050, not a net reduction achieved by using methods such as carbon credits, she said.
"There's only a small opportunity for this kind of forest offsetting to have any role in climate mitigation, so it is being overused and over relied on by many countries," Dooley said.
Blue Carbon would decrease carbon emissions by promoting "sustainable forest management, conserving forests and increasing forest carbon stocks," a draft contract with Liberia says.

Full text: The U.S. now experiences an extreme weather event in which damages and costs top $1 billion every three weeks.
That compares with every four months in the 1980s, when adjusted for inflation, according to the latest installment of the U.S. National Climate Assessment released Tuesday.
For the first time, the assessment includes a separate chapter on the economic impacts of climate action.
Such events cost the U.S. nearly $150 billion each year and disproportionately hurt poor and disadvantaged communities. Other economic consequences of climate change will become more severe unless the country invests more in clean energy and adapts cities to higher temperatures and rising sea levels, according to the assessment.
"While some economic impacts of climate change are already being felt across the country, the impacts of future changes are projected to be more significant and apparent across the U.S. economy," the federal report said.
Ski resorts in the Northwest, farmers in the Midwest and fisheries in the Northeast all face climate-related risks to local economies. Droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and floods occur more frequently because of rising greenhouse-gas emissions, disrupting the U.S.'s food and water supplies and way of life. About 40% of the U.S. population lives in coastal communities exposed to sea level rise, and millions of homeowners could be displaced by the end of the century, the assessment said.
The Energy Department said Tuesday it is making $3.9 billion in federal grants available to upgrade the country's stressed power grid. The Environmental Protection Agency is offering $2 billion for community climate projects.
Such investments are urgent because the U.S. and other countries need to accelerate emissions reductions and remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to slow climate change, Tuesday's report said.

Full text: The energy transition is getting a dose of reality.
Offshore wind projects are being scrapped, and renewable-energy companies' share prices are tanking. In the U.S., automakers are reining in electric-vehicle plans as demand falters.
Meanwhile, the oil-and-gas industry is embarking on a round of megadeals enabled by soaring profits and is pushing more forcefully the idea that fossil fuels will be around for a long time. Climate-warming carbon emissions are expected to climb to a record this year, some researchers say.
"There will be no easy solution or quick fix to the energy transition," James Yardley, an executive at pipeline operator TC Energy, told an audience at an energy-transition conference in Houston recently. Energy-mix forecasts show natural gas, oil and renewables "all play significant roles out to 2050," he said.
The shift away from oil and gas is still happening. Solar and wind capacity is growing fast, governments are rolling out policies to support low-carbon technologies and billions of dollars are flowing into projects ranging from hydrogen production to electric-vehicle charging stations.
Investment giant Brookfield Asset Management last year collected $15 billion in capital for an energy-transition fund and is raising a second fund that it expects to be even bigger.
But Brookfield is seeing increased amounts of money flowing into more traditional types of energy assets, such as liquefied-natural-gas facilities and natural-gas pipelines, which are included in its infrastructure business. The asset manager is raising its biggest-ever infrastructure fund and has already exceeded its target of $25 billion.
"The need for energy is not declining on a global basis," says Matthew Hutton, managing director responsible for energy investments in the infrastructure group at Brookfield.
With headwinds ranging from high interest rates and inflation to geopolitical tensions driving an increased focus on energy security, the path to a low-carbon future looks less straightforward, rockier and more expensive than it did a few years ago.
"I think the transition to a more ESG, solar, wind et cetera world is going to take a lot longer," said Jeffrey DiModica, president of Starwood Property Trust, during an earnings call recently.
A big chunk of the clean-energy industry's woes are macroeconomic. Some of the worst-hit companies started big, expensive projects before pandemic supply-chain bottlenecks helped send the cost of materials such as steel soaring, and interest-rate increases made financing more expensive.
In the U.S., dozens of renewable-power developers increased prices they are charging for electricity and rewritten contracts to try to recoup costs.
French power company Engie raised many of its wind- and solar-power contract prices in the U.S. around 50% compared with before the pandemic, as financing partners demand steeper margins for the high and uncertain interest-rate environment, says David Carroll, the company's North American business head.
Although Engie has seen some customers recoil from those higher power prices, the demand for green energy has been so strong that the company is on track to hit its aggressive goal of installing an additional 12 gigawatts of renewables in the U.S. by 2030, Carroll says.
Still, other companies pulled out of deals completely, such as Danish renewable-power developer Orsted, which this month said it would abandon two wind projects that it was building off the coast of New Jersey, booking a $4 billion loss to do so. It cited factors including supply-chain issues and rates.
Many other wind developers have taken hundreds of millions of dollars in losses on U.S. offshore projects this year, throwing into doubt the Biden administration's goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of such power by 2030.
"A lot of these contracts were entered into when the world was just awash in cheap capital," says Abraham Silverman, who until earlier this year was working with New Jersey's public-utilities board on its offshore wind and solar projects.
Silverman says he was disappointed to see Orsted walk away from the New Jersey projects, since "it was something I spent the last four years of my life working on." Still, "the financial situation on a global basis has fundamentally changed -- at least for the foreseeable future," he says.
Such troubles have helped push down share prices for many renewable-power companies, with Orsted's shares more than halving in value since the beginning of the year, and a big exchange-traded fund that invests in clean-energy stocks, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, down 35%.
As clean-power development faces hurdles, many fossil-fuel companies are encountering less pressure to rush away from oil and gas than they had a few years ago. A big reason is geopolitics, combined with a growing pragmatism as companies and governments find decarbonizing tougher than expected.
The Ukraine war focused governments on energy security after a sharp drop in Russian oil and gas supplies sent fossil fuel prices soaring and led to energy shortages around the world. The disruptions added force to arguments that the energy transition needed to move more slowly, and that it was dangerous to call for sharply trimming investment in fossil fuels, as energy watchdog International Energy Agency has done in reports on steps needed to curb climate change.
The U.S. has seen a political backlash against climate change-focused investing, with a number of Republican-led states and conservative lawmakers pushing for curbs on ESG -- or environmental, social and corporate-governance -- investments. Investors pulled a net $2.7 billion out of U.S. sustainable-investment funds during the three months through September, while a growing number of U.S. funds dropped ESG-related terms from their names, according to Morningstar.
Energy executives point out that economies such as those in the U.S. or Europe will be able to shift to cleaner power sources and electric cars much faster than the rapidly growing and modernizing economies of Asia and Africa, which will need increasing amounts of energy for decades to come.
"There's this notion that it is going to be a linear energy transition," said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of S&P Global and a veteran chronicler of energy trends. "It's going to unfold in different ways in different parts of the world."
Energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which made windfall profits as prices rose during the past few years, are now using billions of dollars of that cash to snap up more oil and gas assets, arguing that the fuels will be needed for a long time to come.
Some analysts say such consolidation isn't necessarily a step back for the energy transition, since the companies bought existing players that have oil and gas holdings that can be harvested quickly -- rather than pumping money into looking for resources that could take decades and billions more dollars to develop.
But investors are more welcoming to such moves than they were two years ago, when activist Engine No. 1 won a proxy fight to get three of its director candidates appointed at Exxon, arguing the company didn't have a good enough energy-transition and climate strategy.

Full text: World leaders vowed in 2015 to reduce emissions in a combined effort to limit climate warming.
Now, they're ramping up production of oil, gas and coal, which will have the opposite effect.
The top 20 energy-producing nations intend to extract double the amount of fossil fuels by 2030 that would be consistent with the threshold needed to keep warming in check.
The contradiction between climate promises and energy production is nowhere more evident than in the United Arab Emirates, which hosts the annual climate summit known as COP28, opening Nov. 30. Diplomats, environmentalists and business leaders will gather in Dubai, to hash out how each nation will reach its climate goals, and debate whether to issue a statement on phasing out fossil fuels in the coming years.
In July, U.A.E. officials said they would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 19% below 2019 levels by 2030. However, state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. plans to boost oil production capacity to 5 million barrels a day by 2027 from the current 4 million barrels a day.
The company also plans to increase liquid natural gas production from the current 6 million metric tons per year to 15.6 million metric tons by 2028, according to a report issued Wednesday by the United Nations Environment Program, the nonprofit Stockholm Environment Institute, or SEI, and several other institutions.
The study analyzed 20 nations that produce 80% of the world's energy. In 2015, world leaders pledged to slow coal, oil and gas production to keep the climate from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
Even positive efforts by some nations will get canceled out. By 2030, the U.S. expects to cut coal production by 43%, while China plans a 15% cut. That drop of 200 million metric tons will be swallowed up by new coal production in India, Indonesia and Russia, the report said.
Although the U.S. is phasing out coal, oil production will reach, and remain, at record levels of 19 million to 21 million barrels per day between 2024 and 2050.
U.S. natural gas is projected to continually increase, reaching 1.2 trillion cubic meters in 2050, the report said.

Full text: The Biden administration's climate push has gotten little love from the other side of the aisle.
Many Republicans have railed against the government's subsidies for wind and solar, excoriated its support for electric vehicles and decried moves to curb oil and gas.
But one clean-energy candidate has broad support from some of the reddest parts of the U.S.: hydrogen.
Take the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, a largely Republican-controlled region that is home to many of the oil and gas refineries in the U.S. Backers of hydrogen in that area include Rep. Randy Weber (R., Texas) and Rep. Clay Higgins (R., La.), a Freedom Caucus member who describes fossil fuels as "the lifeblood of our modern society." Both support a Houston-based hydrogen program vying for a piece of $7 billion in federal grants, though they voted against the legislation that made the grants possible.
"Hydrogen works well with oil and gas," says Weber, a former air-conditioning company owner with a Texas drawl who notes that he has lived within 20 miles of his current home in the Galveston area all his life. Hydrogen "is not a threat to our Gulf Coast," he says.
Weber says he still thinks the spending in the legislation that included the hydrogen grants was excessive, and frowns on government aid for things such as electric-vehicle charging networks. But he favors funding to help hydrogen businesses get started.
In a polarized energy debate that often pits renewables and their Democratic backers against fossil fuels and Republican interests, hydrogen is emerging as a big-tent fuel.
Hydrogen doesn't produce carbon emissions when burned, and companies are looking at it for use in cars, power generation and steel manufacturing.
One feature is that it can be produced using either renewables or fossil fuels. Many environmentalists warn that the flexibility could end up hurting the climate by prolonging the use of oil and gas. But it is also a reason for hydrogen's bipartisan appeal.
"I think hydrogen's going to be the bridge from the renewables to the fossil fuels," says Susan Shifflett, executive director of the lobby group Texas Hydrogen Alliance. "Hydrogen is produced from both sides."
The alliance backed three bills related to hydrogen incentives and regulation in the Republican-heavy Texas Legislature this year, during a session marked by fierce battles over curbs on solar and wind. All three passed nearly unanimously.
Hydrogen is one of the most common elements on earth, but it nearly always appears in compounds such as water or methane. Separating it out into pure form takes a lot of energy.
One method involves splitting the element from water molecules using electricity -- ideally powered by a green source such as wind or solar. That method generates low emissions, but the technology to do it in large volumes is still developing.
Most hydrogen now is made by applying intense heat to the methane in natural gas. That procedure emits a lot of carbon dioxide, but companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron are proposing to clean it up by capturing the carbon and burying it deep underground.
Those companies and others are planning hydrogen-production projects in Texas and Louisiana, which already have pipelines and facilities for hydrogen and natural gas.
"People in Texas see this as a way to continue Texas' role as an energy leader," says Brett Perlman, CEO of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit that helped develop the proposal for the Houston-based hydrogen program.
Not everyone sees the participation of oil and gas companies in building a hydrogen industry as a good thing.
If hydrogen is made from natural gas, that gives fossil-fuel producers another excuse to keep pumping, many critics say. Others warn that capturing and burying carbon dioxide to get rid of the emissions associated with hydrogen production is expensive and might not prove as effective or safe as advertised.
"If you're not using total renewables [in the production of hydrogen], then you're doing less than" what's needed, said Robert Bullard, an urban-planning and environmental-policy professor at Texas Southern University, during a lecture on carbon capture in Houston.
Both Republicans and Democrats like that no country has yet seized the lead in hydrogen, in contrast with clean technologies such as solar or batteries, which China dominates. That means the U.S. has a good chance to move ahead of others, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a Republican-leaning advocacy group for energy and environmental policy.
"You have much more bipartisanship and ability to get things done when you're in that space. . .where the U.S. is strongest," she says.

Pope to Attend
Climate Conference
Pope Francis announced that he would travel to the COP 28 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai next month, becoming the first pontiff to participate in such an event.
The pope's presence at the conference will be one of his most significant gestures drawing attention to protection of the environment, which he has made a signature issue of his pontificate.
Francis announced his plans in an interview broadcast on Wednesday night on Italy's RAI television. He said he would attend the climate conference for three days beginning Dec. 1. The conference runs from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12.
"Our future is at stake, the future of our children and grandchildren. It takes some responsibility," the pope said about the importance of the event.

BELARUS
Passports of Exiles
Won't be Renewed
Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians who fled repression in their homeland face the prospect of having invalid documents after authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree halting passport renewals abroad.
An estimated 500,000 Belarusians fled to the West after Lukashenko was declared the winner of the 2020 election, which was widely seen as fraudulent. Many of them face having no valid documents after the Sept. 4 decree halted passport renewals.
Human Rights Watch has condemned what it called the "draconian" decision, labeling it retaliation against the regime's "critics-in-exile" by putting them at risk of "politically motivated prosecution if they have to return to Belarus to process their documents."

RUSSIA
Volcano Spews
Huge Ash Cloud
Huge ash columns erupted from Eurasia's tallest active volcano Wednesday, forcing authorities to close schools in two towns on Russia's sparsely populated Kamchatka Peninsula.
The eruptions from the Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano sent ash as high as 8 miles above sea level, officials said.
There were no reports of injuries, but officials ordered schools in Ust-Kamchatsk and Klyuchy closed as a precaution. Each town has a population of about 5,000.
The 15,255-foot stratovolcano has been active in recent years and released lava in June.
The Kamchatka Peninsula, which extends into the Pacific Ocean about 4,100 miles east of Moscow, is noted for its array of active and dormant volcanoes, geysers and geothermal springs.

TAIWAN
China Steps Up
Intimidation
Taiwan said Wednesday that China sent 43 military aircraft and seven ships near the self-ruled island, the latest sign that Beijing plans no letup in its campaign of harassment, threats and intimidation.
Taiwan's Defense Ministry said the figure was current for the 24 hours up to 6 a.m. Wednesday and that 37 of the aircraft had crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait, which China no longer recognizes as an informal divider between the sides.
It said Taiwan had monitored the situation, scrambled jet fighters, dispatched ships and activated land-based missile systems, all standard responses to Chinese military activities, which include crossing into Taiwan's air defense identification zone but not into its actual airspace.

Full text: Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with California Gov. Gavin Newsom in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, part of a Chinese charm offensive that appears to be laying the groundwork for Xi to meet with President Biden in San Francisco in November.
China rolled out a red-carpet welcome for Newsom, who is on a weeklong trip in the country promoting cooperation on climate change. The California Democrat took meetings with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Vice President Han Zheng before his audience with Xi on Wednesday.
"I'm here with an open hand, not a closed fist," Newsom said after the meeting, a nod to simmering tensions between the U.S. and China.
Xi, asserting the importance of ties between the two countries, told Newsom that strengthened climate cooperation could become a "new highlight in the development of China-US relations," according to the official Chinese readout.
U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, are planning to hold an in-person meeting in early November in California, people familiar with the discussions said.
Kerry's office didn't respond to a request for comment.
Photos released by Newsom's office showed him shaking hands warmly with Xi as Wang smiled in the background. Han addressed Newsom, the first U.S. governor to meet with China's leader since former California Gov. Jerry Brown in 2017, as an "old friend."
Xi hasn't officially accepted Biden's invitation to meet him on the sidelines of the coming Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco, but a drumbeat of diplomatic activity is raising expectations that it will take place.
Wang is scheduled to meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington this week, with a remit to discuss preparations for a Xi-Biden meeting, other people briefed on the plans said. Meanwhile, basketball star Yao Ming and other Chinese sports, business and cultural figures are visiting New York this week for public engagements.
Xi's meeting with Newsom is "consistent with China's recent diplomatic charm offensive, suggesting a willingness to engage," said Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to a potential Biden-Xi summit.
Chinese officials have been wary of San Francisco, a protest-happy city that is home to large populations of overseas Chinese and Tibetans whom Beijing fears could stage demonstrations against Xi. Newsom was mayor of San Francisco before being elected governor.
China and California have a long history of cooperation on climate change -- the one issue that Beijing and Washington have been willing to discuss in a time of otherwise deteriorating ties. Launched by former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2005, the climate partnership has been lauded by both sides for helping China develop its electric-vehicle mandate and establish the world's biggest emissions-trading program.
California's importance to China as a partner in tackling climate change expanded after the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement during the Trump administration, said Mary Nichols, vice-chair of the California-China Climate Institute, which is led by Brown, the former governor.
Newsom spent Tuesday touring Shenzhen's electric-bus fleet and learning about how the city of 12.5 million residents built 40,000 charging stations. Later in the week, he plans to go to an offshore wind facility -- of which China builds more than any other country.
While climate has been described by both countries as an area for bilateral cooperation, it has emerged as an area of intense competition. China dominates the supply chain for green technologies, and has shown a willingness to use it as leverage, as the U.S. and other allied countries try to build and scale up their domestic renewable-energy industry.
Newsom has traveled outside of California in recent months, increasing his national profile. His current trip helps position him as an international figure and statesman. In reporting on his visit, Chinese media have portrayed him as a potential future face of the Democratic Party.
Before his China trip, he visited Israel, meeting with government officials and talking to people affected by the Hamas attack. During his meeting with Xi, Newsom discussed how China could play a role in defusing tension in the region, his office said.
Newsom said he discussed the issue of human rights with China's foreign minister but not with Xi.

Full text: Chevron said it would buy Hess in an all-stock deal worth $53 billion in the second major oil tie-up this month, after Exxon Mobil's deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources.
The U.S. energy company said buying Hess would upgrade and diversify its portfolio, marking Chevron's entrance into an Exxon-led partnership overseeing a generational oil find in Guyana, while picking up additional U.S. shale assets largely in North Dakota.
The transaction, less than two weeks after Exxon's acquisition of Pioneer, shows the U.S.'s second-largest oil company is similarly tying its future to a bet that the world will continue to have an appetite for oil for decades, even as many countries are seeking to cut emissions and transition toward green energy.
The major oil companies' doubling down on fossil fuels follows a recent prediction by the International Energy Agency that fossil-fuel demand globally would reach its zenith this decade.
"These are two great American companies coming together to be even stronger at a time when investment in American energy is important from the standpoint of jobs and from the standpoint of energy security," Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview on Monday.
The deal values Hess at $171 a share based on Chevron's closing price on Friday, with Hess shareholders receiving 1.025 shares of Chevron for each Hess share. The price represents a premium of 4.9% from Hess's closing share price on Friday and 10.3% when compared with the stock's 20-day average price.
Hess shares closed down about 1% to $161.30 on Monday, while Chevron shares fell 3.7% to $160.68. Including debt, the transaction has a total enterprise value of $60 billion.
The deal comes as oil-and-gas companies are flush with cash after energy prices rocketed in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with executives signaling they were ready to deploy their war chests at the deals table.
Hess has been led for decades by Chief Executive John Hess, who -- along with a few other shale executives -- has made the public case for bolstering domestic energy supplies. Hess is expected to join Chevron's board, Chevron said.
Hess, who owns about 9% of the eponymous company, led it to scoop up a large position early on in the American shale revolution, primarily in the Bakken Shale of North Dakota.
The biggest prize for Chevron is Hess's nearly one-third share of the estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and gas found off the shores of Guyana. Exxon and its partners, Hess and China's Cnooc, have revved up Guyana's oil production from nothing in 2019 to 400,000 barrels a day.
The partners expect to be pumping 1.2 million barrels a day by 2027, making it one of the world's fastest-ever oil developments. By then, the former British colony will be the source of $180 billion in market value for the consortium, some analysts have said.
Exxon Mobil earlier this month struck a nearly $60 billion agreement to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in the largest oil-and-gas deal in two decades. Both Exxon and Chevron have also agreed on smaller transactions earlier this year.
On Monday, Wirth said the deal for Hess would position his company to strengthen its long-term performance and further enhance its portfolio. The combination is also expected to achieve cost synergies of around $1 billion before taxes within a year of closing, the company said. Wirth said the combined company should have an inventory of lucrative drilling locations into the next decade.
Wirth has become a vocal defender of the U.S. oil industry as fossil-fuel producers have come under scrutiny of the Biden administration, environmental groups and European governments for their contribution to climate change.
"I don't think this would in any way be read as not being supportive of a lower carbon future, but it also recognizes the reality that oil and gas are important today and will be for many, many years to come," Wirth said in the interview.
Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, a climate-focused investment group, said Chevron's deal runs counter to the Paris climate agreement and that investors must exert more pressure on oil companies to reduce production.
Chevron's board of directors has said it would waive the company's fixed retirement age to allow Wirth to remain CEO for a longer period as it weighs its C-suite strategy. Wirth became CEO in 2018, when the company was reeling from years of cost overruns made more acute by an oil-market crash in 2015 and anemic energy prices. He was seen as an executive who could corral runaway costs.
In 2019, Wirth refused to enter into a bidding war when Occidental Petroleum swooped in to buy Anadarko Petroleum for billions more than Chevron had offered. Chevron received a $1 billion breakup fee and bought Noble Energy for a lower price the next year, a deal that gave the company access to Middle East natural-gas markets and a bigger U.S. footprint.
Wirth has touted his strategy since walking away from Anadarko to focus on acquisitions that offered low premiums to its targets, including its agreement in May to buy PDC Energy for more than $6 billion. Chevron's deal to buy Hess is its third since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 with a premium of around 10%, Chevron said.
Wirth said he expects Chevron will make a double-digit return on capital employed, a measure closely watched by investors, at midrange oil prices and would be prepared for an oil downturn, should one occur. Echoing other oil executives and analysts, Wirth said it is time that companies scale up via mergers and acquisitions.
"Ours is an industry, particularly as you get into the shale patch, that was due for some consolidation," Wirth said on a call with investors on Monday.
Chevron said it expected the Hess deal, which needs a green light from Hess shareholders as well as regulatory approvals, to close in the first half of 2024.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Big energy producers are sparring over billions of dollars in subsidies from last year's climate law, a fight that pits the Biden administration's goals for economic growth against its efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
The battle is over subsidies to produce clean hydrogen, a potential alternative to oil and natural gas in industries such as steelmaking and trucking where renewable energy and batteries alone aren't adequate. The administration is weighing how strictly to define what energy sources can be used to make clean hydrogen and still be eligible for some of the most valuable tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.
NextEra Energy, Constellation Energy and Plug Power say the subsidies should be widely available -- even to companies that generate carbon emissions -- to spur the growth of a hydrogen industry seen as crucial to limiting climate change in the long run.
The businesses and industry groups have made the argument in advertisements, and in meetings with Biden administration officials, people familiar with the matter said. Labor unions such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have sided with them.
Companies such as Air Products & Chemicals, meanwhile, say the money should go to businesses that use only renewable energy, which could mean slower development and fewer new jobs. Environmental groups have made the same case in newspaper ads; the groups also have appealed to administration officials, a person familiar with the meetings said.
The spat is the latest example of companies in sectors from electric cars to energy fighting over the technical details of clean-energy subsidies that could be worth $1 trillion over a decade.
"The hydrogen rules are make or break," said Leah Stokes, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, focused on energy, environment and climate, who advised Democrats on the climate law and is in favor of tight hydrogen tax-credit rules.
The administration missed an August deadline to write the hydrogen rules. White House officials are considering a range of proposals, including rules that would get stricter over time, a senior administration official said.
Ashley Schapitl, a Treasury spokeswoman, said the agency is trying to make sure the rules strengthen U.S. energy security and address climate change.
The subsidies come atop $7 billion in recently announced federal grants from the 2021 infrastructure law for hydrogen megaprojects across the U.S. to kick-start the industry.
Today, nearly all hydrogen is made by heating natural gas. The method is cheap, but it generates greenhouse-gas emissions. Those can be lowered or eliminated by switching to machines powered by renewable energy that split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
The new tax credit gets more valuable as the production process generates less emissions. The maximum amount for the cleanest hydrogen is $3 per kilogram, roughly enough to make green hydrogen cost competitive with hydrogen made from natural gas.
The heart of the current conflict is in whether companies planning to use fossil-fuel power from electricity grids to make hydrogen would have to buy equivalent renewable energy on an hourly basis or a looser annual standard.
Companies such as NextEra, Plug Power and BP say projects should count as green if they use fossil-fuel grid power but buy renewable-energy credits that match their annual usage. Otherwise, they argue, hydrogen projects won't be viable in much of the U.S.
Constellation, the largest U.S. nuclear-plant operator, is arguing for looser rules allowing existing clean-power projects to be used to make hydrogen. Restrictive rules would halt the company's plans to invest nearly $1 billion in nuclear-powered hydrogen, a spokesman said.
Opponents -- including Air Products, which has plans for green hydrogen facilities that run on new renewable power in states such as Texas -- want stricter rules requiring new clean-energy developments and electricity-matching based on hourly demand. Those rules would likely deny some competitors the tax credits.

Full text: Samari Lakes East, a nondescript condo complex near Miami, was battered by Hurricane Irma in 2017. The storm tore up the roof, causing water damage across Samari's 635 units, home to retirees and blue-collar workers.
The complex's insurer, Heritage Property & Casualty Insurance, said the damage was only $22,107. In April, after a lengthy court battle, Heritage paid $17.9 million. The insurer didn't respond to requests for comment.
"It has been a nightmare . . . horrible, horrible years," said Ivonne Avellaneda, a chauffeur and president of the condo association's board.
Samari Lakes won its fight, but such victories are likely going to get rarer, in part because of climate change. Home-insurance markets are in crisis in some states, due to severe weather, inflation and regulations.
Insurers are responding to heavy underwriting losses by driving up premiums and pulling back from writing new policies.
A few hard-hit states are trying to ease the pain on insurers by making it harder for lawyers to sue. Insurers have long complained that aggressive lawyers with dubious claims have led to higher premiums for their customers.
"The pendulum is swinging from being less friendly to insurers to putting them into a position of strength," said Benjamin Keys, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
In Florida, insurers have long identified excess litigation and fraud as a prime driver of the market meltdown. Many national home insurers have pulled out of the state. Seven Florida home insurers have gone under since the start of 2022, six of them before Hurricane Ian struck the state that year. "In our opinion, these companies were litigated out of business," a spokesman for industry body the Insurance Information Institute said.
Lawmakers in Florida have in the past 12 months responded by overhauling the state's legal system to tackle what Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called its reputation as a "judicial hellhole."
The state has axed the requirement that an insurer has to pay the policyholder's attorney if it loses a case, which was seen as a big incentive for lawyers to take on cases. Florida also has now banned the assignment of benefits, under which policyholders gave roofing contractors or other third parties the right to seek payment directly from their insurer -- a right the industry says was abused.
Florida could provide a blueprint for some other states trying to stabilize insurance markets. One is Louisiana, where several insurers have pulled back or gone under following a series of storms. Tim Temple, a Republican who is set to take over next year as the state's insurance commissioner, supports making it harder to sue insurers to help fix the "broken" market.
In Georgia, the Republican governor and legislative leaders are trying to pass rules to limit lawsuits against insurers.
The nationwide changes aren't all in favor of insurance companies: In Michigan and Texas, the industry is fighting efforts by lawmakers to ease the rules on lawsuits, the spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute said.
Consumer advocates worry that the Florida changes go too far. They accuse the industry of creating a "false villain" of lawsuit abuse, when the real problem lies in a sharp rise in costs from multibillion-dollar catastrophes, such as last year's Hurricane Ian.
The changes will make it harder for policyholders to sue insurance companies for acting in bad faith. Simply showing the company was negligent will no longer be enough to win such a case.
Hurricane Irma damaged roofs, windows and doors at the Samari Lakes condos, allowing water to pour in, an independent assessor found. Avellaneda said her ceiling leaked, her floors and walls were damaged and her unit had large black mold stains. She said most of the complex's elevators stopped working, making it hard for elderly residents.
Heritage's initial assessment was below the condo's deductible. After Samari filed suit, the two sides agreed to appoint an independent assessor, who pegged the damage at $14.9 million. Heritage appealed the decision, court filings show.
Heritage Insurance Holdings, which owns Heritage Property & Casualty, is one of the largest home-insurance companies in Florida. It said in a 2018 state filing responding to Samari's complaints that it "has and will continue to act in good faith." The Tampa-based insurer at that time defended its assessment that little damage was caused by Irma, saying Samari's roofs were old and in poor condition before the storm.
It is too early to tell how great an impact the new Florida legal regime will have on the state's insurance market. Some insurers are already reporting benefits from the new regime. Citizens Property Insurance, the state's insurer of last resort and biggest home-insurer, said it was on the receiving end of fewer lawsuits, with a monthly average for January through June of 785, down 20% from 985 a month for the first half of last year.
That could help at least some policyholders. The change in the law is unlikely to make a dent in Florida's steep home-insurance rates, catastrophe-modeling company Karen Clark said in a report this month. But, the report added, without the changes, "premiums would be higher."

Full text: Federal prosecutors said private documents stolen during an extensive hacking-for-hire scheme appear to have been used to undermine investigations into Exxon Mobil's knowledge of climate change.
The documents, taken from people involved in climate-change advocacy, were among the intelligence collected as part of a five-year hacking campaign targeting thousands of individual victims and companies, according to sentencing documents filed Thursday by the Justice Department.
An Israeli private detective, Aviram Azari, who prosecutors say played a critical role, pleaded guilty in April 2022 to participating in the conspiracy. He is due to face sentencing in a New York federal court next week.
The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office said clients hired Azari to manage various projects that were characterized as intelligence gathering but were instead hacking efforts, stealing user credentials through spear-phishing messages that appeared to targets to have come from a trusted source. They say Azari was paid $4.8 million between November 2014 and September 2019 for his role in the scheme.
Prosecutors didn't accuse anyone of hiring Azari in the court filing. In a court filing last year, prosecutors said his clients "included Israeli, European, and U.S. companies." His lawyer didn't respond to a request for comment.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported that hackers hired by Azari had successfully gained access to accounts belonging to environmentalists and others seeking to hold Exxon and other big oil companies accountable for their alleged deceptions about climate change.
"It was intimidating," Kert Davies, a climate advocate identified by prosecutors as a target of the scheme, said in an interview. He now works for the Center for Climate Integrity but at the time worked for the Climate Investigations Center, both supporting campaigns to hold the fossil-fuel industry accountable for climate change.
"Exxon is not named as a culprit, but their interests were served by this criminal," he said.
Exxon didn't respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
An Exxon spokeswoman told the Journal in a March statement that the company "has no knowledge of Azari, had no involvement in any hacking activities and has not been accused of any wrongdoing. To be clear, Exxon Mobil has done nothing wrong."
The prosecutors said the scheme successfully hacked at least 100 victims, including a climate scientist involved in "a climate accountability campaign that sought to spotlight the role of major fossil fuel companies such as Exxon Mobil."
Other victims include individuals and companies critical of now-defunct German payment processor Wirecard AG, Mexican politicians, African government officials and others, prosecutors said. They said the true volume of individuals and entities, however, has yet to be identified is likely in the thousands and span the globe.
Hacked documents were stolen from victims that were related to New York and Massachusetts attorneys generals' investigations into Exxon's knowledge about climate change and leaked to the press, according to prosecutors.

Full text: Millions of tourists travel to U.S. parks and parkways each year to glimpse the bright colors of autumn -- but ecologists say the familiar reds, oranges and yellows of fall foliage are coming later in the season because of rising temperatures.
"In New England, generally the peak foliage tends to be in the middle of October," said Richard Primack, a professor of plant ecology at Boston University. "But we've been experiencing, because of a generally warming climate, that the peak of fall foliage is tending to move from kind of early to middle October to kind of middle to late October."
Leaf senescence -- the process that involves a tree's leaves changing color before eventually dropping off -- has been pushed back about a week on average since the 1950s in New England, according to Colby College ecologist Amanda Gallinat.
"We see that through on-the-ground observations of individual plants and through remote sensing observations where we're looking at the tree community as a whole," she said.
Predicting precisely when the leaves of birches, aspens and other deciduous trees will turn from green to red, orange and yellow in autumn depends in part on the geographic area, the species in question and precipitation.
Some species, such as red maples, produce an additional pigment during senescence known as anthocyanin, which is responsible for the deep crimson and purple colors that leaf peepers covet.
Climate change can disrupt these autumnal signals. Warmer fall nights can retard the cooling cue, delaying color changes. Extreme conditions associated with higher temperatures, such as drought or dry soil, stress tree health and trigger earlier, and duller, color change and leaf drop, ecologists say.
Other environmental stressors can also have an impact.
Maintaining a leafy canopy is energetically costly. Trees beleaguered by pests and plant pathogens -- some of which are spreading to wider geographic areas because of climate change -- will drop their leaves sooner, according to Christy Rollinson, a forest ecologist with the Morton Arboretum near Chicago.
"Bright colors are associated with a healthy tree, because some of those pigments, particularly like all the red that comes out, take energy for the tree to produce," Rollinson said. "If a tree is stressed, it doesn't have that energy to spare."
Predicting how long fall colors will last is almost harder to predict than when the leaves will start to change color, said Mukund Rao, an eco-climatologist affiliated with Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the Center for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications in Barcelona.
Peak color used to last for about two weeks, according to Rao. For certain species, that period might be becoming more condensed as higher temperatures persist later into the fall.
Such changes could affect the booming tourism industry surrounding leaf peeping, according to Sarah Blount, program director for research and evaluation at the National Environmental Education Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit.
"There's so much money attached to it," she said. "People want to buy a plane ticket to go somewhere and not have it turn out that it's too late and all the leaves are gone or it's too early, so there is a lot of focus on trying to improve the information that we have about that."

Full text: PARIS -- A tsunami of cash is headed for developing countries to address climate change -- and with it growing worries that the money will overwhelm the poorer economies it is meant to help.
Wealthy nations are preparing a plan to send more than a trillion dollars each year to the developing world by 2030, a flood of foreign investment that would be unprecedented in modern history. Much of it would come from the rich world's big institutional investors: pension funds, insurance companies, asset managers, private-equity firms and others. The goal is to provide financing on a massive scale for renewable-energy projects in developing countries and infrastructure to protect poor nations from rising seas, drought and other impacts of global warming.
But capital flows of that magnitude risk sowing economic instability, economists and global-finance officials say, particularly for smaller, poor countries that lack the financial institutions to channel the money into productive investment. A string of financial crises in the developing world has shown that foreign investment surging into these countries often leaves a mess. Debts balloon, currencies become overvalued and economies face a painful reckoning when foreign investors get spooked.
"Rather than being a boon, it could end up being a curse," said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who is advising the Group of 20 major economies on the subject. "This behooves very careful thought in terms of how the financing is structured."
United Nations climate negotiations are the driving force behind the climate finance plan. The financing offered by wealthy nations persuaded poorer countries to agree to Paris accord targets, even though the U.S., Europe and a handful of other nations are responsible for most of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that scientists say are causing the earth to warm.
Leaders gathered this week and last at the United Nations General Assembly are negotiating policies to bring private capital into the developing world for climate projects. The ideas range from boosting the lending capacity of multilateral development institutions such as the World Bank to harnessing the IMF's special currency for green energy.
The leaders of wealthy countries -- which have failed to meet previous goals for providing climate finance -- are trying to muster more of it from their government budgets that would be blended with private capital. Drawing in private investors is crucial for the Biden administration, because congressional Republicans are staunchly opposed to spending government funds for climate projects in the developing world.
The plan is gaining political momentum despite a growing body of research that casts doubt on some of the benefits of foreign investment. Prasad and other economists have found that developing economies that rely heavily on foreign capital haven't grown faster than countries that used domestic capital -- and faced more volatility from currency and capital flows. The spectacular growth achieved by China and India over the past three decades was largely fueled by domestic savings, not foreign capital, economists say.
Economies that have relied heavily on foreign investment, particularly borrowing from abroad, are vulnerable to crises when investors flee. The list of financial meltdowns includes Latin American countries in the 1980s, Asian economies in 1997 and Russia in 1998. The eurozone crisis of the previous decade was preceded by a rush of capital flowing from the currency bloc's core economies to its poorer, southern rim.
"Do we want these capital flows or not?" said Lesetja Kganyago, governor of the South African central bank, during a recent speech at the International Monetary Fund. "Twenty or 30 years ago, the mainstream view was that financial globalization was good. . . . Nowadays, the mainstream view has shifted."
In the fight against climate change, officials say, developing countries probably have no choice but to rely on foreign capital. Big developing economies must accelerate their plans to shift away from fossil fuels if the world stands a chance of limiting warming in line with the Paris accord; the poorest nations are under pressure to develop without burning more coal, oil and natural gas. Those shifts will require investment in clean energy to grow exponentially in the coming years.
"We're asking a handful of developing countries to go through a green transformation that is faster than anyone has done before and faster than it might be natural for their economies to do," said Avinash Persaud, an economist who is the climate envoy of Barbados. "So they're going to have to import some capital -- not all, maybe not even half, but a significant amount."
Persaud said the concerns about foreign investment arise when funding comes in short-term debt or portfolio investments that can quickly leave a country. Persaud and Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley have proposed establishing a fund using money from wealthy governments that would help pay for long-term currency hedges, which are often needed for investments in solar or wind farms that generate revenue for decades.

Full text: LONDON -- For years, Europe has been at the forefront of the global drive to curb carbon emissions and slow climate change, pledging to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Overwhelming numbers of Europeans say they like the idea.
Now, however, a small but growing backlash suggests a more complicated truth: Voters may like the idea more than the reality. As the time draws near to take concrete actions and the costs of the transition become more visible, some members of the public and politicians will get cold feet.
Last week, the U.K. said it would delay a planned ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars and vans to 2035 from 2030, and ease plans to force households to scrap their gas-powered boilers for pricier but cleaner heat pumps. It also promised never to impose a carbon tax on meat or aviation, two other sources of emissions.
"The risk here for those of us who care about reaching net zero by 2050 is if we continue down this path, we risk losing the consent of the British people," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said, arguing that politicians hadn't been honest with working families about the costs.
Germany, run by a coalition that includes the Green Party, also recently watered down its plans to ban new gas heaters for homes after a backlash from homeowners and opposition politicians. Poland's government, facing October elections, is suing the European Union over some aspects of its climate targets, including a 2035 ban on the sale of new petrol cars.
In the Netherlands, a pro-farmers political party that emerged out of protests against the government's plans to limit nitrogen emissions won the highest share of seats in regional elections earlier this year. The surprise victory cast a spotlight on a movement that has pushed back against European and Dutch environmental policies.
The vast majority of Europeans believe that climate change is an urgent priority, with 88% saying they back the EU goal of no net carbon emissions by 2050, according to a recent survey by the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm. That is far higher than the 69% of Americans who favor the U.S. taking steps to become carbon neutral by the same date, according to Pew Research.
Europeans are also far less skeptical on climate change overall. In the U.K., for instance, a YouGov poll found only about 10% of the population say climate change isn't happening or is due mostly to nonhuman factors, compared with between a third and half of Americans, according to separate surveys by Pew and the University of Chicago. And Europe is making progress on cutting back its carbon use: Electricity generated by wind and solar power has now eclipsed fossil fuels for the first time.
But in both the U.S. and Europe, voters can become far more wary when climate policy starts to involve painful trade-offs, especially when it comes to homes or cars. France's yellow vests or gilets jaunes protest movement of 2018-19 began when the government tried to raise taxes on diesel and petrol to aid the country's transition to green energy. The government quickly backtracked.
In August, London's mayor sparked an outcry by expanding the city's ultralow emission zone to surrounding suburbs, imposing a daily charge of 12 pounds and 50 pence, equivalent to about $15, on the most polluting vehicles. Surveys showed the move was deeply unpopular in the suburbs, where people rely more on their cars than in central London.
Some EU officials have acknowledged the pushback. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in August that the bloc's climate policies remain a high priority. But she added that implementing them would require "an even more intensive dialogue with industry, key stakeholders like forest owners, farmers, as well as citizens."

Full text: Many big U.S. companies have been fighting in Washington to block rules requiring them to disclose their greenhouse-gas emissions. They picked the wrong fight.
California and the European Union are both poised to approve rules that require companies that do business there to disclose their emissions. The rules would apply to private as well as public companies and also require businesses to calculate and disclose emissions from their suppliers and customers, which goes beyond what was expected out of Washington.
The size of the two economies -- if California was a country it would have the world's sixth largest economy and the EU as a bloc ranks third -- means that few large companies can duck their rules.
"In one shape or another, these disclosure requirements are coming," said Sara Mahaffy, ESG strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC.
The rules will be among the biggest changes in corporate disclosures in decades. They add climate information to the financial data that companies need to produce, making clear how businesses stack up against one another and whether they are reducing emissions in line with their commitments.
Businesses and Republicans have pushed back against an effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to require disclosures of emissions and climate risks for public companies. It isn't clear whether the SEC will require companies to report emissions from their suppliers and customers.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he plans to sign a bill with his state's rules into law. The rules in Europe are currently under review by the European Parliament and the national governments. They are expected to be approved in the coming months.
California also passed a bill that would require companies to disclose climate-related risks. The rules will take effect over the next several years. The California rules could be challenged in court or by a referendum that opponents could put before voters, a move that gig work employers and fast-food companies have tried in recent years.
Business groups fought against California's emissions disclosure bill before it passed the legislature last week, though some large corporations such as Apple and Salesforce said they support it. It would apply to any business, public or private, that does business in the state and has more than $1 billion in revenue.
Newsom, a Democrat, said at a Climate Week event Sunday he would sign both bills, though he may request some changes when the legislature reconvenes in January.
Investors will use the information to compare businesses, track the companies' progress in reducing emissions and identify companies that are particularly vulnerable to -- or prepared for -- risks related to climate change. These may include physical threats to their operations from events like hurricanes and wildfires, or business that could be left behind by society's transition away from fossil fuels.
Climate activists are betting that the disclosures will enable them to pressure heavy polluters to clean up their operations and raise the cost of capital for firms that don't.
"There is a clear, worldwide, growing regulatory momentum for consistent information," said Steven Rothstein, managing director for nonprofit Ceres' Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets. "Investors, companies, clients, employees, customers are all saying they don't want to be blindfolded."
For companies -- particularly private firms that don't currently disclose much, if any, information about their businesses -- the rules imply a significant increase in data-gathering, processing and reporting. Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in dissenting from the agency's proposed climate rule last year, said they would "eventually rival our existing securities disclosure framework in magnitude and cost and probably outpace it in complexity."
Some industry groups in the U.S. -- including the Farm Bureau, National Association of Manufacturers and U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- have pushed back. In comment letters responding to the SEC's proposed rules, they have hinted at possible legal challenges by arguing the requirements' costs outweigh their benefits and that the agency lacks the statutory authority to implement them.

Full text: Climate progress at big companies is hitting a wall.
The world's largest companies committed to slashing their emissions to address climate change. Many of them have overpromised and underdelivered because of higher costs, slow advances in technology and political pressure.
One big factor is a lack of trust in voluntary carbon markets. Many companies intended to use carbon credits to offset emissions that are hard to reduce, such as the burning of jet fuel by airlines.
Those credits were supposed to cover short-term commitments. Companies are now backing off of these goals while maintaining they are committed to long-term targets. It is a sobering conclusion two years after the 2021 United Nations climate summit in Glasgow jump-started several climate initiatives.
Mining giant Rio Tinto can't hit a near-term emissions target without using carbon offsets. Delta Air Lines and other carriers are under similar pressure. Shell and BP dialed back green-investment plans under pressure from investors. Amazon.com recently shelved a target to slash delivery emissions by 2030.
"Many companies are learning that the beginning of decarbonization is easy," said Gunther Thallinger, a board member at insurer Allianz who leads a U.N. climate-focused investor group. "The moment you really need to go into true transformation, the work becomes quite difficult."
This week, executives and government officials are in New York City for the U.N. General Assembly and related climate events. Some companies are announcing new climate goals, but many lack a clear path to achieve them. Governments are lagging behind on their commitments, too, according to the U.N.
The Treasury Department published on Tuesday best practices for financial firms with long-term climate targets, building off work done by a U.N.-convened alliance and others to get banks and investors to move faster after making pledges.
Rio Tinto said recently that it would miss its 2025 emissions target unless it used carbon offsets, which Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm called a last resort. The company blamed the slow deployment of clean energy and low-carbon equipment.
"The Western world is not moving very fast" on renewables, Stausholm said on an earnings call. Less than two years ago, he said, "we have a clear pathway to decarbonize our business."
Environmental nonprofit CDP said that among nearly 19,000 companies using its disclosure platform last year, 81 had credible climate-transition plans. One company on a list of 160-plus big emitters -- Italian utility Enel -- had fully aligned its capital-spending plans behind the energy transition as of last year, according to an investor climate initiative.
A U.S. advertising watchdog recently asked meatpacking company JBS to halt making claims such as "bacon, chicken wings and steak with net zero emissions. It's possible." The body said JBS doesn't have a plan to deliver on the claims. JBS's business has been linked to deforestation in Brazil by environmental groups.
JBS disagrees with the watchdog's decision and is reducing emissions while working with partners on issues such as deforestation, a spokeswoman said.
Carbon credits were supposed to be used to neutralize emissions until technologies such as green hydrogen and carbon capture were available. But many cheap offsets tied to projects such as forestry or wind farms have been shown to have limited benefits.
Those concerns chilled the market. Credit purchases fell 9% year over year in the first half of 2023, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of market data. Prices also fell.
Delta, JetBlue and EasyJet together accounted for nearly 15% of carbon-credit purchases since 2020 but all reduced their purchases in the past year, according to data provider Trove Research.
Delta plans to redirect much of its spending toward sustainable aviation fuel later this decade, Chief Sustainability Officer Amelia DeLuca said. Delta's in-flight napkins previously claimed it was a carbon-neutral airline, prompting a class-action lawsuit.
"We're pulling all available levers today," DeLuca said. "Offsets were the only lever in 2020. . . . The levers that are available to us continue to change."
JetBlue and EasyJet are pursuing similar investments in new technologies.
Few expected that shifting to clean energy would be quick, easy or cheap. There are bright spots, including subsidies that spurred billions of dollars of investment in renewable energy, green hydrogen, batteries and electric vehicles. If successful, these will help companies make progress.
Setting climate goals creates progress by prompting companies to focus on their emissions. New rules coming in Europe and California will require carbon disclosure for nearly all big U.S. companies. The Science-Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, a nonprofit that assesses climate targets, endorsed more than 3,400 companies' goals and said ambition is increasing.
Still, some companies are failing to do what they promised. SBTi recently named about 120 companies, including Amazon.com, that didn't follow through on their commitments to set goals endorsed by the group.
Amazon's Climate Pledge network for companies has encouraged others to set goals endorsed by SBTi, which Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Earth Fund has backed.
The company withdrew a plan to make half of its shipments "net zero" by 2030. Amazon said the effort was superseded by a businesswide plan to achieve net zero by 2040, but that doesn't include nearer-term publicly announced goals for delivery emissions.
Amazon is progressing on its companywide targets and own science-based goals, said head of worldwide sustainability Kara Hurst. SBTi's process doesn't suit complex, high-growth businesses like Amazon, she said. SBTi declined to comment on individual companies' targets.
Hurst said Amazon is nurturing green industries by being an early buyer of products such as sustainable aviation fuel and paying a high price to remove carbon from the air. The company is the world's largest corporate buyer of green power.
Mining company Vale recently missed a deadline to secure SBTi's endorsement, largely because of the group's aversion to offsets.
A spokeswoman for Vale said the company is giving priority to emissions cuts, but might use some offsets because of the difficulty of decarbonizing steelmaking.
Higher commodity prices partly stemming from the war in Ukraine upended many companies' plans to shift toward renewables.
BP and Shell are slowing their transitions to lower-carbon energy and steadying fossil-fuel output to please investors who wanted the companies to take advantage of higher energy prices.
Shell is cutting emissions from its operations and energy products, a spokesman said. BP is committed to its long-term climate targets, a spokeswoman said.
Renewables funding needs to be four times fossil-fuel financing to meet climate targets, analysts said.
Green-energy funding is expected to rise to about $1.7 trillion this year, according to the International Energy Agency. Fossil-fuel spending is set to climb to about $1.1 trillion.
Renewable-power prices have also risen after years of declines, complicating companies' purchase plans. Supply-chain disruptions, higher interest rates and grid-connection delays have disrupted wind and solar markets.
Political pressure from Republicans is intertwined with some business challenges.
A U.N. group called the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or GFANZ, that is trying to boost private-sector investment has lost a few members who fear lawsuits and retaliation from Republican politicians if they are part of a group limiting fossil-fuel funding.
Curtis Ravenel, a senior adviser to GFANZ, said the political pressure and subsequent turbulence "was a distraction and a pain in the ass."
He added: "Every year we hit these headwinds and delays means there's more to be made up in the subsequent years."

Full text: KUWAIT CITY -- Ice-cream seller Ramadan Daber pops painkillers to relieve the headaches induced by this city's merciless heat, as he waits for customers for nine hours at a stretch. Sometimes he can't see because of the humidity. At other points, he struggles to breathe.
"It's like there's no oxygen," said Daber, one of thousands of Egyptian migrants who work on Kuwait's searingly hot streets, his only shade from a thin red-and-orange parasol.
As this year simmers toward being the hottest in history, the Gulf is at the center of the cauldron. Temperatures in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean region where Gulf states sit have risen almost twice as fast as the global average every decade since 1981, according to analysis of historical climate data and current observations.
In Kuwait, one of the world's hottest countries, the speed of the temperature rise means tough conditions are quickly becoming unbearable. Mitribah in the country's northwest hit 54 degrees Celsius, or 129 degrees Fahrenheit, in 2016, the third-highest temperature ever recorded on Earth, exceeded only by Kebili, Tunisia, in 1931 and Death Valley, Calif., in 1913.
In summer, a season that stretches from June to early October here, daily peaks over 120 degrees Fahrenheit are becoming more common.
Kuwait is seeing more days where temperatures exceed 122 degrees, according to data from the Kuwait Meteorological Department.
In the decade from 2011 to 2020, Kuwait recorded 48 days where the temperature reached 122 degrees or above, compared with 15 days in the decade from 2001 to 2010 and nine days from 1981 to 1990, the department said. The two decades previous to that saw no temperatures so extreme. The weather has fluctuated in recent years, with last year seeing only three days reaching 122 degrees or above, but 2021 seeing a dozen such days.
Millions of migrant workers in the Gulf, many of whom make a living outdoors, are among the people most immediately exposed to global warming.
"They are the canaries in the coal mine so to speak for climate change," said Barrak Alahmad, a researcher at Harvard University who studies the impact of heat in Kuwait. Non-Kuwaiti workers in the country are three times as likely to die on days of extreme heat as the local population, according to his research.
The dangers of working at blisteringly high temperatures have pushed some Gulf states to impose varying bans on outdoor work during the middle of the day, but the rules aren't always enforced. Morning and nighttime can also be dangerously hot, especially when humidity and high temperatures coincide, say doctors and labor activists.
Kuwait bans outdoor work from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in June, July and August, but like most of the region brings in migrant workers under the kafala system, where employers control sponsorship permits and hold the passports of their employees.
Labor-rights activists say the unequal power dynamic leaves migrant workers vulnerable to exploitation. Government healthcare for migrant workers in Kuwait is available but basic, and most workers don't seek medical help, to avoid fees they can't afford.
A growing body of scientific research shows that major organ damage from heat is due in part to muscle tissues breaking down as the heart pumps blood away from vital organs toward the skin where it can cool off.
Kuwaiti health officials say they haven't seen a rise in heat-related symptoms among migrant workers being reported by the country's hospitals. Spokespeople for Kuwait's Public Authority for Manpower, which put in place the midday ban, and the Ministry of Health didn't respond to requests for comment.
Despite the ban on working outside during the day, Daber's daily shift selling ice cream goes from 2 p.m. to 11 p.m. and he only earns money when he makes sales.
Daber's go-to method to cool down is sticking his head over the icebox. He also keeps a blue towel in there to wipe his sweat and chill his eyes.
"I pray to God," he said. He also relies on his friend who works in an air-conditioned electronics store opposite when things get too much.
Despite the dangers, though, the ability to send money to their families keeps Daber and others like him working in the sun-scorched conditions. "We're forced to do this because there are no jobs in Egypt," he said.

MANSION --- Lawns Gone Wild! --- More homeowners are turning away from green grass lawns and toward a more natural look incorporating native trees, bushes and plants that nurture pollinators and wildlife

Full text: Within Denver's Washington Park neighborhood, an enclave south of downtown where the median house listing price is just over $2 million, quintessential manicured American lawns roll out in front of historic brick bungalows, restored Victorians and contemporary new builds. Then there is Lisa Negri's yard, which sits adjacent to her three-bedroom, two-bathroom bungalow where she's lived since 2012.
"It looks like nature," says Negri, 66, a retired engineer.
Roughly 50,000 plants comprising 92 species engulf her 0.14-acre lot, which until 2020 sported green lawn grass. She estimates the yard has cost roughly $75,000 for plants, bulbs, seeds and hardscaping. Negri's creation, designed by Kevin Philip Williams, assistant curator of horticulture at Denver Botanic Gardens, rejects the time-honored status symbol of a tidy lawn in favor of a new luxury: the rewilded yard.
"Rewilding is returning land to a more natural state," says Allison Messner, co-founder and CEO of Yardzen, a landscape-design company with clients nationwide. Rewilding a lawn typically involves introducing regionally appropriate plants, also called native plants, and fostering habitats for local wildlife. People come to the practice for myriad reasons. Some people want to support pollinators; some want to avoid water-guzzlers; others want to signal they are climate conscious. But the overarching purpose is universal: to encourage the flourishing of natural ecosystems and to mitigate the effects of habitat loss and climate change.
In Negri's yard, this means interweaving prairie grasses and southwestern shrubs commingle with pockets of bulbs, wildflowers and succulents, all chosen to thrive in Denver's climate, which is warm and dry in the summer and harsh in the winter, and has fierce year-round sun because of the altitude. Plants also specifically open the door to animals, insects, fungi and bacteria.
The space is one big meshed movement that throughout the year waxes and wanes in color, height, shape and texture. A low-slung, post-winter skeletal brown becomes spring's sprouting rainbow of lush hues, which gives way to summer's 8-foot, reach-for-the-sky feathery silvers and waxy blues before fall's explosion of radioactive yellows and Martian reds take hold for a last gasp as winter's white waits in the wings.
A total of 9,000 plants and bulbs were planted in 2020, largely with help from neighbors and friends. Since then, Negri has planted fewer than 1,000 new plants but has added a large number of seeds. It took a year of significant watering to get roots established. Now the only substantial maintenance required is cutting the yard to the ground in the spring and watering two to three times a year.
"A niche group of people has supported yard rewilding over the past decade or so, but recently it's become much more mainstream," Messner says. In 2022, Yardzen saw a 66% year-to-year increase in clients replacing green lawn grass with fully rewilded yards. "We're not seeing thousands of people say, 'Tear out my lawn and put in a rewilded yard,'" she says, but the majority of Yardzen's clients are rewilding in some capacity. Last year, 90% of new Yardzen clients installed some type of native plants. "Things are moving in this direction," she says.
Rewilded yards look different depending on climate and topography. In general, however, they support the web of life from below the ground up to the canopy, and every ecological layer in between, says Melissa Marie Wilson, CEO of Mill Valley, Calif.-based landscape firm Want Green Gardens. Lawns are nonexistent or minimized with native grasses. Plants bloom throughout the seasons. Native trees anchor the yard and provide wildlife with food and year-round shelter.
Eden Passante, 38, and Zan Passante, 47, worked with Yardzen to rewild their half-acre lot about 30 miles northwest of Los Angeles in the ranch community of Newhall, Calif. They purchased the property in 2016 for $560,000 and spent $400,000 gut-renovating their space, which totals 2,100 square feet and has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a guesthouse. They estimate they have spent $65,000 on rewilding. Plants cost about $10,000; hardscaping cost the most. The bulk of the designing and planting took five months.
Today, the grassless yard is filled with whimsical flowers and succulents, such as blue chalksticks and large blue agaves. Gravel pathways lead to sitting and dining areas and a fire pit. There are garden beds for vegetables and edible flowers and a separate herb garden for mint, thyme, oregano and pineapple sage. A citrus grove has a Eureka lemon tree, a Meyer lemon tree, a yellow grapefruit tree, a lime tree and an orange tree.
"They are half native plants but all of the plants are drought-tolerant and zoned for this area," says Eden Passante, who is the CEO of the home-entertaining website Sugar and Charm. Wildlife is active in the yard. A partridge laid 12 eggs under a bush. Pollinators love the blooming citrus trees.
The yard is low maintenance. "I try to let nature do its thing, but I remove any invasive weeds and keep the pathways nice," she says. "The only difficulty is keeping the dust, rocks and pebbles out of the house." Sometimes she wishes there was a soft play surface for her two young children.
Emily Murphy, an ethnobotanist with a background in ecology and environmental science and author of the regenerative gardening book Grow Now, says it is easy to get in the weeds with rewilding terminology. "It's evolving in real time," she says, noting that the word rewilding sprung up in conservation biology and ecology circles in the 1990s in reference to large-scale efforts to restore biodiversity and improve the integrity of landscape and natural systems.
Murphy says that rewilding a yard will obviously look very different from rewilding, say, a National Park. "Purists would say -- and there is always a purist -- that your yard can't be compared to the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone." But she believes that rewilded yards do contribute to the greater good. "Once you plant native plants, biodiversity will come," she says, giving the example of a native oak tree, which can support roughly 2,300 species of animals and insects. In comparison, a non-native Chinese ginkgo has been documented to support five or fewer local species.
Jennifer Ehlert, vice president of landscape-design firm Metro Blooms Design+Build in Minneapolis, says rewilding costs roughly the same as other landscaping. "A DIY pollinator patch might be in the hundreds," she says. "Hiring a landscaping company to design and build some portion of a rewilded yard might be in the thousands. Rewilding your whole yard might be in the tens of thousands. If you're into the hundreds of thousands, you have a huge property or you're hardscaping as part of a bigger project."
Dan Dufficy, founder of Mill Valley, Calif.-based California Native Landscapes nursery, encourages clients to start small. "Customers aren't used to seeing these plants," he says. "Their friends aren't used to seeing these plants. They have no idea what the maturity of the product looks like." To help clients get excited, he uses his hands to animate what plants look like and he uses vivid, educational language.
Not everyone is excited about yard rewilding. Homeowner associations can have landscape aesthetic rules. People who are allergic to bees have legitimate concerns. And then there are neighbors who just don't get it.
Her first summer of rewilding, Lisa Negri in Denver received a cease-and-desist order from the city, which closed her down for eight months. "A neighbor called the city on me and said, 'We don't know what this person is doing. We're afraid of it,'" Negri says. With the help of her garden designer and several horticulturists, she put together a 90-page presentation and ultimately received an open space conservation zoning designation, which is one of several types of conservation-related protections homeowners can pursue locally. Some cities -- such as Austin, Texas, Evanston, Ill., and Green Bay, Wisc. -- have passed ordinances in support of wildlife-friendly homeowners. This is also happening at the state level. In Minnesota, for example, a new state law bans cities from limiting managed natural landscapes.
In Santa Monica, Calif., Roshanna Baron is having the opposite problem: Neighbors are copying her 0.13-acre rewilded yard. She and her husband, Nir Einhorn, 48, bought their house for $1.1 million in 2017. The couple received a landscaping blank slate when their yard was torn up during a nine-month renovation of their home, which has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and totals 2,220 square feet, including their short-term rental guesthouse.
Planning their fully rewilded yard lasted about a month. Buying and installing $4,000 worth of plants took about two weekends with the help of a gardener. At first the landscaping felt empty, but after a year it was grown in. Three years later, the yard is colorful and warm with green- and blue-tinted plants, flowering succulents and a Meyer lemon tree. They kept a 75-year-old persimmon tree, the fruit of which keeps getting better as the yard's soil improves.
"I've been stopped several times from husbands or wives saying they are planning on copying our yard," says Roshanna Baron, 51, who works in entertainment-industry talent relations and event planning. "One specifically told me he was copying everything because his wife loved it so much. A stranger parked in front of our home to tell me they aspire to have a yard like this."

Full text: Exxon Mobil issued its first public statement that burning fossil fuels contributes to climate change in 2006, following years of denial. In public forums, the company argued that the risk of serious impact on the environment justified global action.
Yet behind closed doors, Exxon took a very different tack: Its executives strategized over how to diminish concerns about warming temperatures, and they sought to muddle scientific findings that might hurt its oil-and-gas business, according to internal Exxon documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and interviews with former executives.
Exxon's public acceptance in 2006 of the risks posed by climate change was an early act of Rex Tillerson, an Exxon lifer who became CEO that year. Some viewed him as a moderating force who brought Exxon in line with the scientific consensus.
The documents reviewed by the Journal, which haven't been previously reported, cast Tillerson's decadelong tenure in a different light. They show that Tillerson, as well as some of Exxon's board directors and other top executives, sought to cast doubt on the severity of climate change's impacts. Exxon scientists supported research that questioned the findings of mainstream climate science, even after the company said it would stop funding think tanks and others that promoted climate-change denial.
Exxon is now a defendant in dozens of lawsuits around the U.S. that accuse it and other oil companies of deception over climate change and that aim to collect billions of dollars in damages. Prosecutors and attorneys involved in some of the cases are seeking some of the documents reviewed by the Journal, which were part of a previous investigation by New York's attorney general but never made public.
One of the lawsuits is from Hawaii's Maui County, where wildfires killed more than 100 people in August. The lawsuit, filed in 2020, alleged the island faced increased climate-related risks, including more dangerous wildfires, caused by fossil-fuel companies. Some of the lawsuits may go to trial as soon as next year.
"I know how this information looks -- when taken out of context, it seems bad," Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in response to the Journal's inquiry about the documents. "But having worked with some of these colleagues earlier in my career, I have the benefit of knowing they are people of good intent. None of these old emails and notes matter though. All that does is that we're building an entire business dedicated to reducing emissions -- both our own and others -- and spending billions of dollars on solutions that have a real, sustainable impact."
Under Woods, who became CEO in 2017, Exxon has committed to spend $17 billion over five years on emissions-reducing technologies. Exxon didn't address detailed questions sent by the Journal.
Tillerson declined to comment through a representative.
Exxon turned millions of pages of documents over to the New York attorney general during that office's investigation, announced in 2015, into whether the company misled investors about the impact of climate regulation on its business. The Journal reviewed summaries of the documents that Exxon's lawyers had determined were the most significant. After the attorney general narrowed the focus of the case, the documents weren't made public.
After a nearly three-week trial in 2019, Justice Barry Ostrager of the New York State Supreme Court ruled the New York attorney general failed to prove its case. "Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve Exxon Mobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change," Ostrager wrote.
Throughout Tillerson's tenure between 2006 and 2016, Exxon executives in their internal communications attempted to push back against the notion that humans needed to curtail oil and gas use to help the planet -- despite the company's public statements that action was needed.
As pressure mounted to stop drilling in the Arctic due to rapid glacial melting and other environmental impacts, Exxon fretted about a key project in Russia's far north and worked to "de-couple climate change and the Arctic."
"The general perception is that Tillerson was softer and stopped funding the bad guys" that were espousing climate change denial, said Lee Wasserman, the director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, a charity that partly focuses on environmental issues. "This is the first X-ray into Tillerson's head and shows he wanted to throw climate mitigation off the rails. It's obituary-changing."
The fund has issued grants financing litigation and other support for around two dozen cases against Exxon, whose predecessor, Standard Oil, was founded by family patriarch John D. Rockefeller.
A study published earlier this year in the journal Science determined Exxon's climate modelers had predicted warming temperatures with precision since the 1970s, in line with the scientific consensus. The study was funded, in part, by a grant from the Rockefeller Family Fund.
In the summer of 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen issued what's now seen as a seminal warning on climate change when he testified before Congress that Earth was warming dangerously and humans were causing it.
Frank Sprow, then Exxon's head of corporate research, sent a memo to colleagues a few months later articulating what would become a central pillar of Exxon's strategy.
"If a worldwide consensus emerges that action is needed to mitigate against Greenhouse gas effects, substantial negative impacts on Exxon could occur," wrote Sprow. "Any additional R&D efforts within Corporate Research on Greenhouse should have two primary purposes: 1. Protect the value of our resources (oil, gas, coal). 2. Preserve Exxon's business options."
Sprow's memo was adopted by Exxon as policy, he said in a recent interview.
Exxon stopped most internal climate research, instead funding it through university and research organizations, Sprow said. Exxon's corporate research division was redirected from broader scientific study to focus on "science to support our business."
Sprow said he and former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond acknowledged the climate was changing but questioned to what extent human activity was causing it and how serious and rapid the impacts would be. The January study in Science said that Exxon's climate modelers mostly attributed the changes to humans.
"It's an oblique way of saying we're in the oil business and we're not going to get out," Martin Hoffert, a climate-science consultant to Exxon in the 1980s, said of Sprow's memo.
By the time Tillerson became CEO in 2006, Exxon's positions on climate change had become a public-relations nightmare, according to Sprow, who retired from the company in 2005.
In 2006, Exxon said that it recognized "the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere poses risks that may prove significant for society and ecosystems."
Tillerson's views on climate change were influenced by the previous generation of Exxon executives, said former company executives who worked with him. During his tenure, Tillerson took little action to curb the company's emissions and instead believed the onus was on governments to push companies to address climate change, they said.
In 2011, scientists working for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, convened by the United Nations, warned of global calamity if carbon emissions caused temperatures to rise more than 4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2100, its worst-case scenario.
Tillerson told a top Exxon climate researcher the scenario was "not credible," the documents show. Tillerson was "dissatisfied with media coverage," the researcher, Haroon Kheshgi, told colleagues in a 2012 email about the findings. Further, Tillerson wanted to engage with IPCC "to influence [the group], in addition to gathering info."
Chris Field was the co-chair of an IPCC working group during Tillerson's tenure at Exxon. He rejected Tillerson's criticism that the worst-case scenario laid out by the group wasn't credible. Though emissions reductions are preventing the worst case, Field said, the science has held up over time.
"I'm honestly flattered that he thought IPCC was consequential enough to want to influence it," said Field, who is now director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. He added that the IPCC process is structured to prevent undue influence from individual businesses and that the Exxon scientists he'd dealt with were professional.
Meanwhile, Exxon's scientists were themselves modeling alarming increases in carbon emissions without dramatic reductions in fossil-fuel consumption.
"It's almost reluctantly that we address C02 emissions," Scott Nauman, a corporate planning manager, wrote in a January 2009 email as the company was preparing its annual energy outlook. "It is not a positive story. Global emissions continue to rise throughout the outlook timeframe -- that's clearly a cause for concern."
Exxon routinely pushed back against the idea that dramatic curtailment of fossil-fuel consumption was necessary. Instead, it suggested that technological solutions, including making cars and other machines more efficient, were the most effective measure to halt global warming. Fossil fuels are responsible for more than 75% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IPCC.
Before giving a speech at an event hosted by Stanford University's Global Climate & Energy Project in February 2009, Tillerson appeared to make edits to avoid embracing positions that would hurt Exxon's business. In one part of the draft speech he crossed out "oil, natural gas and coal will not meet all of the world's needs to the year 2030." Later, he added, "the most cost effective steps we can take to address this energy and environmental challenge is to extend our energy efficiency gains."
Weeks earlier, Nauman had concluded in his January email that emissions would increase through 2030 despite such gains. "We would like them to be lower, but given the state of technology, given the need for energy, given the practical choices for energy, emissions rise despite aggressive efficiency gains," Nauman wrote.
In 2008, Exxon announced it would stop funding think tanks and other groups that questioned climate science, saying their positions "could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure the energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner."
Exxon researchers continued to support scientific research that cast doubt on climate science and its impacts, documents show.
Later in 2008, Gene Tunison, a manager of global regulatory affairs and research planning, said Exxon should direct a scientist to help the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's influential lobbying group, write a paper about climate science uncertainty.
"I support [Exxon] co-authoring a paper on uncertainty in measuring GHGs," Tunison wrote in an email.
Tillerson also pushed back against some of the dire consequences of rising temperatures predicted by climate scientists. After a 2011 meeting, Tillerson's chief of staff, William Colton, emailed colleagues about the CEO's feedback on a draft disclosure about carbon emissions. Tillerson wanted the words "weather extremes and storms" deleted. "His view was that even mentioning a possible connection between climate change and weather was possibly giving the notion more credibility than he would like," Colton wrote.
During a 2012 board meeting, Exxon Director Peter Brabeck-Letmathe said, "Money and effort spent on climate change is misplaced."
In December 2015, Exxon publicly stated its support of the just-signed Paris climate agreement, a nonbinding United Nations treaty that commits countries to work to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Climate scientists have warned that if Earth warms more than 2 degrees it could cross irreversible climate tipping points.
Months before the treaty was signed, Tillerson had expressed skepticism about its aims. Following a presentation on climate science to Exxon's board of directors in April 2015, Tillerson called the 2 degrees target "something magical," according to a summary of the meeting.
"Who is to say 2.5 is not good enough," said Tillerson, noting that it was "very expensive" to cut the emissions needed to meet such a target.
"When people like Tillerson argue that 2 degrees is magical, it's in the context of how you try," said Field, the former IPCC co-chair. "Two degrees can be affordable with the right costs and benefits globally, even if it is not the right costs and benefits for Exxon."
Exxon said in August that the world isn't currently on track to reach the targets of the agreement, which it continues to support publicly.
Shortly after replacing Tillerson in 2017, Darren Woods spread the word that he was in search of transformative new ideas. A plan to invest in offshore wind projects made its way to the most senior levels of the company, according to people familiar with the proposal. Karen Hughes, a former top official in the George W. Bush administration and an adviser to Exxon, said she counseled that investing in renewable energy would be good for the environment and improve the company's reputation.
To date, Woods hasn't invested in renewable energy, arguing it's a low-return business outside Exxon's skill set. Instead the company has vowed to spend about $3.4 billion a year on average through 2027 curbing its emissions and helping other companies do the same, and investing in areas including carbon capture, biofuels and lithium mining.
Exxon currently plans to spend as much as $25 billion a year in capital expenditures through 2027, mostly on oil and gas.

Full text: Artificial intelligence can help tackle climate change, but to fulfill that promise companies need to find a way to limit AI's climate impact.
Information and communications technologies contribute up to 3% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, according to many estimates. Data centers emit about the same amount as the aviation industry and consume hefty amounts of water. And as AI grows, the energy required to train and run its large-language models will increase.
AI can cut emissions by making systems more efficient. Alphabet's Google and American Airlines used AI to help planes create fewer vapor trails, which contribute to global warming. Google uses it to forecast river floods and to recommend eco-friendly routes on its maps service. San Francisco startup Verse is using AI to simplify the process for companies to get clean power.
For many companies using AI there are positive and negative effects on their carbon emissions and water use.
Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at AI-application developer Hugging Face, worked with two other researchers to map the lifetime carbon footprint of a machine-learning model with 176 billion parameters named Bloom -- and what they learned was startling.
The factors outside of the energy used in training the models -- something most research in the field doesn't factor in -- "wound up being so significant they doubled total emissions," she said.
For instance, manufacturing a graphics-processing unit -- a piece of hardware that speeds up computations in deep learning -- involves pure water and rare metals. That adds to climate cost. Bloom used more than a thousand of these GPUs in its training, and that is just one of many external factors Luccioni's group evaluated in their research.
But models of similar parameter size to Bloom, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT-3, had significantly higher carbon emissions -- more than 20 times as much -- and consumed around three times as much power as Bloom.
Energy sources are a large contributing factor in the emissions discrepancy, Luccioni said. If the electricity being used to train the models is sourced from something "cleaner," that can cut down carbon emissions, even without changing the size of the large-learning model.
In the U.S., where there is no central electric grid, training models in one state versus another can have a significant impact on carbon emissions. In California, where there are large amounts of wind power, emissions could be lower than if the exact same model were trained using energy in a state like Virginia, which is reliant mostly on fossil fuels for power.
If Bloom does better by environmental standards than other large-language models, that is still relative. It used enough energy in training the model over March to July 2022 to power the average American home for 41 years, according to an April 2023 Stanford report. The training run had 25 times the emissions of one passenger's round-trip flight from New York to San Francisco, and over a third more than the average American in one year.
AI is very thirsty, according to research this year from Shaolei Ren, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California Riverside.
His work shows ChatGPT-3 needs to "drink" a 500-milliliter bottle of water for a basic conversation of 20 to 50 inquiries, depending on where the electricity is generated. ChatGPT-4 likely consumes more than that, though secrecy around the platform and training means not enough data is public to make an accurate inference.
His group's estimates for one of Google's large-language models, known as LaMDA, had water use on the order of a million liters for training alone. Google's on-site data center water consumption overall in 2022 rose roughly 20% compared with 2021.
"Wherever we use water, we are committed to doing so responsibly. This includes using alternatives to freshwater whenever possible, like wastewater, industrial water, or even seawater," the company said in a blog post late last year. Google has a 2030 target to replenish 120% of the water it consumes, on average, across its offices and data centers.
Research from Google estimated its carbon emissions from training the LaMDA model at 26 tons, or the equivalent of about 22 passengers on a round-trip flight between San Francisco and New York.
As with electricity use, water use can become more efficient depending on where it is drawn from. Microsoft said last year that its Asian data centers' actual water-use effectiveness was three times worse than that of the company's locations in the Americas, meaning water use for identical AI training could triple based on location. That is because it is typically warmer in Asia, which necessitates water-cooled chillers.
Meanwhile, a practical step in limiting emissions would be to not integrate AI into platforms that don't need it, said Hugging Face's Luccioni.
"The cost of all these shiny new toys is unsustainable if you're just switching out all these technologies that are working quite well to begin with, with these much more energy-intensive applications," Luccioni said.

Full text: California would force large corporations that do business in the state to disclose all greenhouse-gas emissions associated with their operations, under a bill being considered by the legislature in its last, frenzied week of work in this year's session.
The proposal, which would apply to both public and private companies with $1 billion or more in annual revenue, is one of hundreds the Democratic-controlled legislature must decide on before Friday.
As the most populous state in the U.S. and one that has long leaned left, California often sets the agenda for other blue states, with progressive policies that pass the legislature in its last working days of the year.
Beyond the emissions-disclosure bill, part of a long-running push in the state to combat climate change, the legislature also is considering bills that would end a ban on official travel to states with conservative social policies and make striking workers eligible for unemployment benefits.
The legislature on Thursday passed the nation's first statewide excise tax on firearms and ammunition and a bill decriminalizing small amounts of hallucinogenic mushrooms for personal use.
But in the final days of vote-wrangling in Sacramento, the emissions measure is attracting some of the strongest opposition, primarily from business groups.
If it clears the legislature this week and receives Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's signature, California would be the first state in the nation to mandate the calculation and disclosure of a company's direct and indirect emissions that cause climate change.
At the heart of the dispute is whether to include in such calculations the indirect emissions known as "Scope 3," caused in a company's supply chain or by distributors or customers. According to an analysis by research firm Morningstar earlier this year, Scope 3 accounts for as much as 90% of climate emissions in certain sectors.
Business groups argue such calculations would be nearly impossible to make accurately and would place undue burden on companies and their suppliers.
"There's no way for a frozen pizza company to be able to calculate the emissions of the tomato farmer who plants the seed, grows the tomato, that gets processed into sauce that gets put on their pizza," said Ben Golombek, chief policy officer for the California Chamber of Commerce. "It's about trying to shame companies over inaccurate data as opposed to generating good public policy."
Several of California's largest technology companies, including Apple and Salesforce, have said such calculations are possible and are supporting the proposal.
Bill author Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco, said the legislation allows businesses to use estimates and modeling for Scope 3 calculations, and that greater transparency is key to getting them to shrink their carbon footprints.
"There are corporations that are already making these disclosures and trying to be transparent, but then there are others who are marketing themselves as green when they're not," Wiener said. "For investors, it'll be useful information."
Wiener estimates some 5,300 businesses could be subject to the bill, including more than 3,900 privately held companies.
Some current and past staff of the California Air Resources Board, which would be tasked with administering the law, have raised concerns that implementation could be costly and divert resources from enforcing other climate laws.
The bill passed the state Senate in May and is now awaiting consideration in the Assembly, where its prospects are uncertain. Newsom hasn't taken a public position on the measure. A law passed in 2006 already requires some California companies and facilities, such as fuel suppliers, to disclose their emissions annually.

Full text: Energy investment in Africa needs to more than double by the end of the decade if the continent is to meet its energy and climate goals. However, high costs are putting off much-needed investment in the region's plentiful clean-energy resources and huge reserves of critical minerals, the International Energy Agency said.
"African countries have huge energy potential, including a spectacular range and quality of renewable-energy resources," said Fatih Birol, executive director of the Paris-based agency in a report published jointly with the African Development Bank on Wednesday. "But these riches are largely untapped and they will remain so without greatly improved access to capital."
Africa is home to more than half the world's best solar resources as well as possessing great potential for hydroelectric and wind-power projects, according to the IEA. It also is uniquely placed to contribute to industries behind the transition away from fossil fuels. It accounts for 80% of the world's platinum reserves, half of all cobalt reserves and 40% of manganese reserves, all of which are expected to be crucial to technologies such as autocatalysts and electric batteries, the agency said.
The report's figures also pose a challenge for the West and the U.S. in particular, which is seeking to secure diverse sources of critical materials. In recent years, the West has lost clout in Africa as China has become the continent's largest trading partner and fourth-largest investor. Much of China's investment in Africa goes toward energy projects and the nation's lead in renewable technologies will likely see it grow as a funder of African renewable-energy projects, the IEA said.
"Energy investment on our continent has fallen short," wrote William Ruto, president of Kenya, in the report's foreword. "It is imperative we take bold steps to more than double energy investment here in the next decade, with a primary focus on clean energy."
From around $90 billion today, annual spending on Africa's energy needs must more than double to $200 billion by 2030, two-thirds of which will need to go toward clean energy projects, the report said.
Despite the investment goal -- which the IEA says will allow African nations to meet their agreed climate targets as laid out in the Paris Agreement and achieve universal access to modern energy systems -- energy spending in Africa has been falling over the past five years as investment in fossil fuels has declined and spending on renewable energy projects has flatlined. The continent makes up just 3% of global energy spending.
The indebtedness of many African nations is holding back public spending on energy projects while private investors are reluctant to invest because of a prevalence of fragile states, absent regulations and perceptions of political or reputational risks.
All of these are pushing up the cost of capital, which makes many African energy projects financially unviable despite ample local resources and proven technologies such as wind or solar power, the report said.
The cost of capital for a large-scale renewable-energy project in Africa is up to three times higher than in advanced economies and China, the IEA said. For smaller projects, which will be crucial in rural areas, the costs are even higher.
Concessional financing -- in which lenders such as international development banks offer developing nations more generous terms such as lower interest rates or longer repayment periods -- will be crucial to overcoming those obstacles, the IEA said.
The IEA estimates that only half of electricity grid projects in Africa are commercially viable without such assistance, while most clean cooking projects would be unaffordable.
The report came as African leaders met in Nairobi for the third and final day of the Africa Climate Summit, which has seen calls for debt relief for African nations facing the effects of climate change and hundreds of millions of dollars pledged to Africa's nascent carbon credits initiative.

Full text: CHICAGO -- Engineers have spent nearly 50 years and billions of dollars building huge tunnels and reservoirs to protect this city from flooding. In a changing climate, it may no longer be enough.
A July 2 storm dropped more than 8 inches of rain on some parts of the city and its suburbs, flooding tens of thousands of basements and prompting a federal disaster declaration. Once the tunnels and main reservoir were full, sewage and storm water poured into the Chicago River, forcing officials to reverse its flow and send the tainted mix into Lake Michigan, the region's main source of drinking water.
The Tunnel and Reservoir Plan, also known as the Deep Tunnel -- over 100 miles of tunnels and three reservoirs covering different parts of the region -- has kept a trillion gallons of sewage-tainted water out of local waterways since 1981, at a total cost of $3.8 billion, according to the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.
A huge addition to the McCook Reservoir serving Chicago and certain suburbs is expected to open in 2029, adding 6.5 billion gallons of capacity to the current reservoir's 3.5 billion gallons. That will further reduce the frequency of spills into the Chicago River, but officials aren't certain even that will be enough to bottle up the biggest storms.
"It's sort of a Catch-22," said Kevin Fitzpatrick, assistant director of engineering for the reclamation district, just before heading 300 feet below ground to show a visitor the giant pumps that send the water after storms to a huge sewage treatment plant. "We're in a lot better spot because we have the reservoirs, but the storms that we're getting now are a little bit more than maybe they designed this thing for in the 1970s. It's so unpredictable with these weather patterns."
Chicago isn't alone in wrestling with storm runoff and sewage spills amid more intense storms kicked up by the warming climate. Infrastructure built for the storms of the past might not be enough to withstand the events of the future as climate change alters rainfall patterns, raising difficult questions about how cities will be able to adjust massive projects to handle more water without incurring prohibitive costs.
"Almost everything that's been built in the past couple of decades is just undersized for the type of rain events that we get today because of climate change," said Bob Dean, chief strategy and program officer at the Center for Neighborhood Technology, a Chicago-based nonprofit that recently published a study showing that storm and wastewater systems in Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, South Bend, Ind., and Buffalo, N.Y., were built to address now-outdated storm data.
"A lot of times we're designing these things for yesterday's storms, not tomorrow's storms," said Rob Moore, senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental group. "Beyond that, it's the fallacy that the single engineered solution is going to protect us."
Philadelphia and other cities are leading the way in using what is known as green infrastructure to divert water from the storm-drainage system through things such as rain gardens, permeable alleys and other projects, he said. Reclamation district officials for the Chicago area are also pouring money into projects such as converting hard-surface school playgrounds into artificial-turf soccer fields that can store rainwater and release it slowly into the storm-water system, officials said.
In Chicago, the deep tunnel project does little to alleviate one major source of flooding: areas where older local pipes aren't big enough to send water out of the neighborhoods during big rains.
That is one reason why there were so many flooded basements with the July 2 storm, officials said. "We were getting flooding complaints before the reservoir was full," said Ed Staudacher, assistant director of maintenance and operations with the reclamation district. "It's not even getting to us quick enough before they're flooding."
Lavelle Parker, 44, who drives a street sweeper for the city's streets and sanitation department, said the 2 1/2 feet of tainted water that flooded his basement apartment in the Austin neighborhood sent a couch across the living room and ruined his possessions.
"I've been living in Chicago all my life and I've never seen a flood like that," said Parker.
Austin and the suburbs of Cicero and Berwyn had rainfall that would be expected to happen only once every 500 years, while other areas received the equivalent of50- to 100-year rainfalls, all within about six hours, said Kevin Doom, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
To get ready for the coming rains, workers in the glassed-in control room off the lobby of the reclamation district's Chicago headquarters opened gates southwest of the city to lower river levels and make room for storm water, Staudacher said.
As the deluge gained steam, runoff and sewage began flowing through the massive deep tunnel toward the McCook Reservoir. When the reservoir topped off, the dirty water started flowing straight into the river, which rose 6 feet, threatening to spill its banks. That is when reclamation district officials and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened locks and gates, allowing water to flow into Lake Michigan.
Researchers say green infrastructure and analysis of massive data sets through tools like artificial intelligence and machine learning could help the district cope with bigger storms ahead. "You have to adapt to what Mother Nature throws at you, and right now Mother Nature is as upset as it can possibly be," said Marcelo Garcia, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Full text: SINGAPORE -- Cigarette smoking and other uses of tobacco shave an average of 2.2 years off lifespans globally. But merely breathing -- if the air is polluted -- is more damaging to human health.
That is the conclusion of a report published Tuesday by the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute, which identified air pollution as the world's top threat to public health, responsible for reducing average life expectancy by 2.3 years worldwide.
China, once the poster child for smog-filled skies, has been a surprise success story. Between 2013 and 2021, the world's second-largest economy improved overall air quality by more than 40%, while the average lifespan of residents increased by more than two years, the report said.
By contrast, four countries in South Asia -- India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan -- accounted for more than half of the total years of life lost globally because of pollution in the atmosphere during the same eight years. India alone was responsible for nearly 60% of the rise in air pollution worldwide during that time.
If India were to meet World Health Organization guidelines for particulate pollution, the life expectancy for residents of capital city New Delhi would increase by 12 years.
India's Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change didn't respond to a request for comment.
An increase in wildfires in places such as California and Canada has renewed attention on the dangers of polluted air. About 350 cities globally suffer the same level of dangerous haze that enveloped New York City in June at least once a year, according to calculations from environmental think tank Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, which aggregates data from dozens of official government sources.
How seriously a country takes the problem typically depends in part on public awareness, said Michael Greenstone, an economics professor at the University of Chicago who contributed to the report. Knowledge of the health risks of poor air quality is low in many African and Asian countries, which suffer the worst outcomes.
"Air-pollution improvements are often driven by the demand of the people," he said. Having access to reliable monitoring tools to enforce clean-air requirements also is important, he added.
China's fight against air pollution began in the early 2010s, when an influential property tycoon, pointing to Beijing air-quality data published by the U.S. Embassy on Twitter, launched a social-media campaign that pressured the Chinese capital into being more transparent about pollution levels. Public demands continued and spread until the central government launched a "war on pollution" in 2013. Now, there are nearly 25,000 emissions-monitoring devices installed in plants and factories nationwide that provide publicly available hourly updates on emissions data.
The devices make it difficult for local officials to tamper with data and obscure environmental violations. Meanwhile, air quality became an important metric in evaluating the performance of local officials.
An experiment by U.S. and Chinese university researchers over eight months in 2020 across China showed that public complaints about air-quality violations, on social-media platforms for example, were more effective in reducing a firm's subsequent violations and emissions than private appeals.
China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment didn't respond to a request for comment.
Besides premature death, sustained exposure to air pollution can lead to a variety of illnesses, including heart disease, lung cancer and diabetes, other studies have shown.

Full text: Exxon Mobil says the global effort to curtail greenhouse-gas emissions isn't on track to keep the planet's temperature from rising beyond an increase of 2 degrees Celsius by 2050.
Carbon-dioxide emissions stemming from the world's burning of fossil fuels and energy consumption will shrink to 25 billion metric tons in 2050, down 26% from a peak of 34 billion in the current decade, the oil giant said in an annual outlook on Monday.
Despite the decline, the trajectory would still keep worldwide carbon-dioxide output well above levels that the United Nations' climate-science advisory body says would limit climate change and its most dangerous potential effects.
To achieve the targets outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs emissions to drop to 11 billion metric tons on average by 2050, Exxon said.
It added that the world's current push to curb carbon-dioxide emissions by more than 25% by 2050 "is a testament to the significant progress expected to be made," and will occur even as the global economy more than doubles in size.
"Even so, more is needed to hit the emission-reduction levels required to keep global temperature increases below" 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with the start of the industrial revolution, Exxon said.
The Houston-based oil company faces dozens of lawsuits across the U.S. accusing it of climate-change deception, seeking billions in damages. Former Exxon Chief Executive Lee Raymond, who led the company from 1993 to 2005, openly questioned the extent to which humanity was contributing to climate change and its risks, which was at odds with the company's internal research, the lawsuits allege.
The oil company has said it supports the 2015 Paris climate accord, a nonbinding agreement that commits scores of countries to efforts to keep the planet's temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. But the company has maintained that the world will have to keep consuming oil and natural gas to fuel economic growth.
"Fossil fuels remain the most effective way to produce the massive amounts of energy needed to create and support the manufacturing, commercial transportation, and industrial sectors that drive modern economies," Exxon said in its report Monday.
The company has said it would invest $17 billion in coming years to reduce its own emissions and those of customers. It has held up carbon capture, hydrogen and biofuels as technologies that could help curb emissions, especially in heavy-industrial sectors seen as difficult to decarbonize.
Earlier this summer, shareholders of Exxon and its main rival Chevron struck down proposals urging the companies to cut emissions derived from fuel consumption, put out new reports on climate benchmarks and disclose oil-spill risks, among other climate-related initiatives some investors had pushed.

Full text: In Maine, lobsters are heading north and some lobstermen are moving into kelp farming. On the West Coast, fishermen are worried about a blob of warm water developing off the Oregon and Washington coastlines, fearing a repeat of an ocean heat wave that devastated salmon harvests from 2014 to 2016.
The heating of the world's oceans is disrupting ecosystems and industries that depend on the sea for life.
This summer, nearly half the world's oceans are experiencing a marine heatwave, defined as warmer than 90% of previous temperature observations on the same date, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Mediterranean Sea reached a record 87 degrees in July, attracting stinging jellyfish and lionfish, while threatening coral reefs and tropical marine life nearby.
Marine heatwaves are expected to become stronger and more frequent, according to a consensus of oceanographers and climate scientists.
One of the fastest-warming waters is the Gulf of Maine, forcing lobstermen to change tactics to save their businesses.
Summer surface temperatures between July and September in the gulf have risen four times the global ocean average since 1982. The entire region is warming more rapidly than 97% of the ocean's surface because of overall climate warming and a shift in local currents, according to the Gulf of Maine Research Institute.
The warming is making life more unpredictable for the $388 million lobster fishing industry in Maine. The U.S. lobster catch has moved 162 miles northward and nearly 70 feet deeper over the past 50 years, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, as the crustaceans seek refuge in colder water. The Maine lobster catch has fallen 26% since a record catch of 132 million pounds in 2016.
Some harvesters in the state are looking for new species, such as black sea bass, tuna or crabs.
Steve Train, a third-generation lobsterman in Casco Bay, Maine, has become a farmer. He started growing kelp -- something still plentiful in the area -- offshore of his property to earn money during spring months when lobstering is traditionally slow.
Train says kelp is no substitute for lobsters, still the most lucrative single-species commercial fishery in U.S. waters. But it can help as Maine's coastal environment changes.
"The people who survive are going to have to be diversified so they can take the cream out of a few different fisheries and have a paycheck year round," Train said as he pulled up a string of lobster traps onto his 32-foot boat Marcia, a few miles from the Portland wharf where he sells his catch.
Some climate scientists believe the world's oceans could be undergoing an environmental regime change as the result of decades of rapid climate warming in the atmosphere.
The oceans absorb 30% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and 90% of the excess heat from those emissions. Scientists wonder if the ocean's ability to regulate human-induced climate change is reaching its limit.
For six of the past seven years, the tropical Pacific Ocean has been close to or cooler than normal and has been absorbing excess heat from the atmosphere, according to Michael McPhaden, senior scientist at the NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle.
Now with a strong El Nino pattern underway in the Pacific, that excess heat is being released to the atmosphere where it is affecting ocean circulation patterns and contributing to the spate of marine heat waves in different parts of the globe, McPhaden said.
"There's a host of bad things that happen to weather systems, the climate system and the ecosystems and fisheries when you have so many and such strong marine heat waves," McPhaden said.
There are other possible explanations in addition to climate change and the El Nino/La Nina cycle. New pollution rules have cut airborne sulfur aerosol particles released by commercial ships over parts of the ocean, clearing the air and allowing more sunlight to reach the ocean surface. That in turn might be heating the water along some shipping routes, although the amount is in dispute, according to several recent estimates.
In January 2022, an underwater volcano near Tonga blasted 50 million tons of water vapor into the stratosphere. Some researchers believe that vapor might be acting as a planet-warming greenhouse gas and nudging up ocean temperatures. Both theories are still under investigation, and their overall impact is up for debate.
Sea ice that wraps Antarctica in a protective blanket has shrunk by a Greenland-sized chunk during the winter season, when it should be expanding. The continuing loss of sea ice is harming vital shrimp-like krill that forms the base of the Southern Ocean food chain. It's also leading to a "catastrophic" decline in emperor penguins in one area, according to a study last week.
In the Florida Keys, a heat wave that began in June continues to threaten coral reefs that serve as a haven of biodiversity, a nursery for commercial fish species, and a natural barrier against storm-driven waves that threaten homes and communities.
All along the Keys, researchers from the Mote Marine Laboratory are in a race against time to save corals that can't survive the influx of 95-plus degree water. Researchers and volunteers moved thousands of heat-stressed corals from offshore nurseries to on-shore facilities. "We are in the midst of a mass bleaching event," said Jason Spadaro, director of Mote's coral restoration research program.
Bleaching happens when the water gets so hot corals reject the symbiotic organism that lives in their tissue and turns sunlight into the nutrients corals need.
Seagrass beds and mangroves that protect the U.S. coast from storms are also under threat from warming waters. Eelgrass in the Chesapeake Bay is being replaced by widgeon grass, which likes warm water, but may be less protective of larval fish that call the bay home.
To understand what's happening in the Gulf of Maine, researchers at the Bigelow Center for Ocean Science, a non-profit research institute in Boothbay Harbor, are exploring the water using ships, satellites and ocean-going autonomous gliders. In 2022, Bigelow scientists reported that the ability of phytoplankton -- the grass of the sea and base of the food chain -- to reproduce in the gulf declined 65% over two decades.
On a recent day aboard the Bigelow's 48-foot research vessel, David Fields worked with a graduate student and a technician to launch and retrieve a device that measures water temperature at several depths. They also towed a fine-mesh plankton net that collected a soup of miniature marine life they transferred into a 10-gallon plastic bucket.
Inside floated shrimp-like amphipods, comb jellies, sea gooseberries and baby lobsters with outstretched claws that look like mini-supermen. As the waters warm, Fields said he is noticing more jellyfish and fewer of the more nutritious, fat-filled animals favored by commercial fish species.
Fields, a zooplankton ecologist and oceanographer, is focused on a couple of species that are eaten by fish and marine mammals such as the North Atlantic right whale. He said the mix of marine animals and plants in the gulf is changing.
One wild card is the timing of the plankton blooms in the water each spring. As waters warm, fish or lobster eggs hatch before their food is ready, and they are less likely to survive the crucial few weeks of life, Fields said. "There's just less food being produced."
Richard Wahle, director of the University of Maine's Lobster Institute, says the Gulf of Maine is not only warming rapidly, but a shift in currents is depriving the Gulf of the water-borne nutrients that have made it fertile grounds for generations of New England fishermen.
"We're seeing this increasing influence of warm, salty, nutrient-poor water that's essentially starving the Gulf of Maine of what it has historically been, which is a place of world-class productivity," said Wahle.
In Casco Bay, Steve Train has watched Maine's lobster population shift north, driven by changes in bottom water temperatures and the supply of the tiny animals that are the main food of baby lobsters. Over time, Train has been moving his traps to deeper water and said he has noticed a faster temperature increase in the past five years. "I started setting gear in June where I thought the lobsters would be in August or September," he said. "Everything the lobsters do is by water temperature."
Train and other lobster fishermen own licenses that are tied to specific fishing grounds. So there are limits on how far north or offshore they can set their traps. Train, 56, says his kelp-farming venture isn't as easy as he initially thought. "Between the moorings, the storms, the tide, and the stretch of the line, there's a lot of maintenance," Train said. "But now I have another month or two filled in for cash flow."
He said he is figuring out the best direction to suspend ropes in the water that are embedded with kelp seeds to avoid tidal currents that could damage his harvest. The seeded ropes mature into an underwater forest. He expects to be profitable this year, while expanding from 4 acres to 10 acres.
Each spring, Train collects wide fronds of brownish-yellow kelp and sells them to Atlantic Sea Farms, a Biddeford, Maine-based company that processes seaweed into kelp burgers, smoothie cubes, and pet-food additives. It has signed up 30 lobster fishermen across Maine since it launched in 2018, and another 19 are in line for a state license, according to CEO Briana Warner. "We're building an entirely new market," said Warner.
Train said lobstermen he has known for decades are beginning to consider a future that will reward adaptability as waters continue to warm. "Even the people that are in denial are a little concerned," he said.

Full text: About three years before the fires in Hawaii, hot, dry winds threatened to sweep western Oregon and elevate the risk of wildfire. State officials advised utility companies to do something unusual: pre-emptively shut off power lines to prevent sparks.
PacifiCorp, a utility company serving parts of Oregon and other Western states, didn't shut off its lines. Three years later, the unit of Berkshire Hathaway is embroiled in litigation over whether it was negligent in failing to take that step, a wildfire prevention measure that to date has rarely been used outside California.
Oregon's 2020 Labor Day fires burned more than 1.2 million acres, destroyed more than 5,000 homes and businesses, and killed nine people. PacifiCorp's power lines are believed to have played a role in several of the fires, though official investigations are pending and the company denies negligence.
Now, utilities across the West are pushing to get shut-off plans in place as wildfire risk -- exacerbated by heat, drought and climate change -- increases alongside litigation risk. Industry executives and observers expect companies to employ this strategy more frequently, making it likely that more utility customers will experience outages during fire season for years to come.
"Climate change is driving much more extreme conditions," said Ryan Murphy, director of electric operations at Puget Sound Energy, which serves 10 western Washington counties. "As the risks change, so must our tools and so must our processes."
Murphy said the company began last year assessing its riskiest circuits and conferring with customers, local officials and others about how to best communicate the need for outages and minimize their impact. It aims to have an initial shut-off plan in place next year.
Other utilities have been hit with lawsuits attacking their decisions to keep the lights on in risky conditions.
In Maui, the site of the deadliest U.S. fire in more than a century, Hawaiian Electric is facing a financial crisis and mounting litigation over indications that its power lines might have played a role in igniting the fire. It didn't shut down its power lines ahead of time.
Maui County filed a lawsuit on Thursday alleging that the company's power lines ignited the fire, and that it was negligent in failing to take that action. It also alleges that the company didn't take proper measures to safely maintain its system.
"We are very disappointed that Maui County chose this litigious path while the investigation is still unfolding," Hawaiian Electric said in a statement.
Xcel Energy, which serves parts of eight Western and Midwestern states, is similarly dealing with litigation related to its likely role in a 2021 fire in Colorado and its failure to implement a shut-off as winds picked up.
Xcel declined to comment. It has publicly disputed findings that its lines probably contributed to the fire.
Shutting off power is difficult and complex: It can affect water, transportation and communications services. It can endanger customers who rely on electricity for medical needs and complicate evacuation processes. And it results in economic losses by forcing business closures.
Utilities aren't required by regulators to shut off power in risky conditions, but numerous regulations direct them to operate their systems safely, as well as reliably. Michael Wara, a lawyer who directs the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University, said safety might have to come at the expense of reliability during periods of dry, heavy winds capable of transforming sparks into wildfires.
"Utilities need to have a process to evaluate when it is safe to operate their systems in red-flag conditions," he said. "If they don't, that's a problem."
Lawyers suing PacifiCorp scored a victory in June when a jury determined that the company owes about $90 million in damages to certain members of a class-action lawsuit who lost homes in the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon, and that figure could eventually top $1 billion as others pursue claims. The company has said it would appeal the decision.
During the trial, PacifiCorp attorneys told the jury that the company didn't turn off the power because doing so created other risks, while attorneys for the victims argued that the company didn't have the proper structures and processes in place to make the decision. According to the company, it has improved its shut-off plan in recent years.
"It doesn't make sense to wait for regulators to step up or to wait for some catastrophe to happen before utilities have a plan to shut off the power," said Matthew Preusch, a partner at Keller Rohrback who represented victims in the case. His firm plans to pursue litigation against Hawaiian Electric.
In a statement, PacifiCorp said it has invested substantially in reducing wildfire risk and developed shut-off plans for the areas it serves.
California regulators first determined in 2012 that the state's investor-owned utilities had the authority to shut off power to protect public safety. Since then, most of them have done so during periods of high risk, typically for autumn windstorms.
PG&E, the utility company serving most of Northern California, in 2019 implemented unprecedented shut-offs that left millions of people in the dark for days. Economists estimated that losses amounted to billions of dollars. The company has since installed technologies allowing for a more surgical approach.
During the 2020 Labor Day fires, Portland General Electric, Oregon's largest utility, shut off power in risky areas for the first time. It did so again in 2022, and is working to refine its ability to pinpoint risky areas and better target shut-offs.
Larry Bekkedahl, Portland General Electric's senior vice president of advanced energy delivery, said the company once relied on Portland International Airport readings to assess the weather throughout its service territory.
It has since installed 69 weather stations to gather granular data on wind speeds, humidity levels and other variables that help it determine whether shut-offs are necessary in the fire-prone foothills surrounding the Willamette Valley.
"We no longer have to worry about what's happening down in the southern part of the valley versus the northern part," he said. "We can get right down into the canyons and see what's happening."

Full text: The technology to remove carbon from the atmosphere is unproved at scale and the economics are just taking shape. What has become clear this year is that carbon removal is now the realm of giant companies and government support.
The Energy Department this month committed $1.2 billion to create two carbon-removal hubs in Texas and Louisiana, home to a large portion of the U.S. fossil-fuel industry. The biggest competitor in the Texas project will be Occidental Petroleum, which has its own billion-dollar bet on the technology.
Three deals this year cemented corporate involvement in the sector: Exxon Mobil is buying one of the biggest operators of pipelines that move carbon to sites where it can be stashed underground. Occidental is buying one of the two most established carbon-removal technology companies. The other experienced carbon-removal startup completed the first third-party verified process and cashed in on it by selling carbon credits to Microsoft and other big companies.
The most prominent carbon-removal technology favored by the government, Occidental and these startups is called direct-air capture. It employs vacuumlike devices and fans to suck in air, pull out the carbon and bury it underground. The process is a man-made variation of what trees do every day.
It differs from carbon capture, which grabs carbon from smokestacks. This effort is considered easier because those emissions are far denser with carbon than the open air.
The Energy Department money, which is a record investment in the sector and the largest from a government, is designed to create an industry that is seen as vital to limiting climate change. Even the most optimistic scenarios of the transition away from fossil fuels don't forecast sufficient emissions progress without removing some of what is there already and mitigating unavoidable emissions in the future.
"We have to get these projects up and running so there's a commercial wave that follows them," said David Crane, the Energy Department's undersecretary for infrastructure. He previously was chief executive of power-generation company NRG.
If funded and completed, the two carbon-removal hubs would remove roughly 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually and store it underground. That amount is equivalent to the annual emissions of about 220,000 gasoline-powered cars, which is a fraction of what is needed overall to limit climate change. Each project would be roughly 250 times bigger than the only direct-air capture facility currently in commercial operation.
The Energy Department is also trying to spur a feasible business model for the industry by pledging to pay $35 million for carbon that the companies remove from the air. These are the same type of carbon-credit purchases that Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase have made recently to kick-start the industry. That funding also isn't limited to direct-air capture, potentially boosting other promising approaches.
Large fossil-fuel companies have long been interested in technologies that remove carbon from the atmosphere because they could neutralize the emissions their products create.
Occidental, the most aggressive fossil-fuel giant in carbon removal, is spending billions of dollars on the effort. Chief Executive Vicki Hollub has said direct-air capture would enable the company to keep producing oil for decades.
The company said recently that it is buying one of its technology partners on the Texas hub, startup Carbon Engineering, for $1.1 billion, the largest such transaction in the industry.
Many climate analysts remain skeptical of carbon removal, worrying that it is too expensive while fearing it could give fossil-fuel producers a social license to continue polluting. Critics argue that removing carbon from the atmosphere just to offset new carbon pumped in by fossil fuels won't help fight climate change. "It really does raise some fundamental questions about the political sustainability of these efforts," said Danny Cullenward, a research fellow at American University's Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy. "People are increasingly assuming that oil production and [direct-air capture] go together. That's not healthy if your goal is to separate those things."

Full text: In the spring of 2004, a small United Nations team meeting in Geneva faced a big challenge: Convince the world's largest investors to care more about responsible business practices.
Organizations had tried for years to get Wall Street to hold companies accountable for their performance on the environment, social issues and corporate governance. It would help, the U.N. team thought, if that wordy, three-pronged philosophy could be distilled in a snappy name or acronym.
Environment, the sexiest and most tangible category, should be at the forefront, Paul Clements-Hunt, the leader of the team, recalls thinking. Governance could fortify the end. That, fittingly enough, left social issues smack in the middle.
A white paper the team produced afterward, "Who Cares Wins," is often credited with giving birth to the ESG moniker that has since become a central issue in boardrooms worldwide.
In the nearly two decades since that meeting, ESG has become part of the vernacular of investing -- and an increasingly divisive political issue. But the ideas behind it reach back centuries to religious groups harnessing their financial power to bring about change, and, more recently, legal scholars debating the role of corporations in society.
Here is a history of how we got to what is today known as ESG.
1700s
Religious sects confront an industrializing economy that expands financial opportunities for better and for worse. Methodist leader John Wesley advises congregants against "any sinful trade," while some Quaker leaders condemn the practice of slavery.
1930s
The Great Depression prompts many to question corporate responsibility. A.A. Berle and E. Merrick Dodd's debate in the Harvard Law Review marks a seminal public discussion of how companies balance duties to shareholders and society, says Elizabeth Pollman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.
1953
Howard Bowen helps popularize the idea of corporate accountability in his book "Social Responsibilities of the Businessman." But the concept runs up against the rise of institutional investors and Milton Friedman's shareholder theory, which argues that a firm's responsibility is to boost profits.
1971
Two United Methodist ministers opposed to the Vietnam War launch the Pax Fund, among the earliest mutual funds to consider companies' social and environmental performance. "They didn't want to invest in weapons or weapons manufacturers," says Joe Keefe, president of the company now known as Impax Asset Management.
1999
U.N. Security General Kofi Annan urges business leaders to adopt socially responsible policies amid rapid globalization. "The spread of markets outpaces the ability of societies and their political systems to adjust to them, let alone to guide the course they take," he says at the World Economic Forum.
2000s
A U.N.-commissioned report helps put forth a legal case for ESG by establishing a link between corporate actions around it and financial performance. Soon after, several companies join the U.N. in developing Principles for Responsible Investment, a pledge to incorporate ESG factors into business strategies.
2015
Amid mounting research and public concern about climate change, roughly 200 governments sign the Paris Agreement to set goals on fossil-fuel emissions and slow global warming.
2017
BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink tells corporate chiefs in his annual letter that ESG helped guide the world's largest asset manager in evaluating firms for investment. Other Wall Street mainstays make similar statements.
Today
Republican politicians slam ESG as "woke capitalism" that sidelines the goal of creating shareholder value, pulling asset managers and corporate executives into the country's culture wars. BlackRock's Fink says in June that he believes in "conscientious capitalism," but no longer uses the "weaponized" ESG term.

Full text: KKR has added three senior executives to help build a new climate-investment strategy aimed at backing companies that fall between early-stage technology developers and mature renewable-energy generators.
Charlie Gailliot recently joined the New York-based firm to lead the strategy alongside Emmanuel Lagarrigue, who joined late last year, the firm said. Both were named partners and global climate co-heads and are based in New York. KKR also has hired Neil Arora as partner to oversee its climate-focused investments in Asia out of its Singapore office, according to the firm.
During the past decade, KKR said it committed more than $13 billion to infrastructure investments related to the shift to clean energy, including in renewable-power company NextEra Energy and Viridor, a U.K.-based waste-management operator. The private-capital firm is forming a dedicated investment strategy because it sees untapped opportunities in areas that are less risky than the new clean-energy technologies typically backed by venture-capital investors but also not as mature as operating solar and wind power assets, said Raj Agrawal, KKR's partner and head of global infrastructure.
"There's extraordinarily high-risk, high-impact and ordinarily low-return, low-risk approaches to climate investments," Agrawal said, adding that there is a dearth of capital focused on companies that fall between the two approaches. "Our strategy is to attack the middle."
The three newly hired executives' backgrounds are well suited for the types of infrastructure businesses KKR's climate strategy targets, Agrawal said. He cited as examples operators of proven but still expanding technologies, such as battery systems, biofuels and electric transportation, as well as renewable-energy developers and companies that help reduce carbon emissions in traditional infrastructure assets.
For example, Lagarrigue served as chief strategy, chief sustainability and chief innovation officer at France-based Schneider Electric, which supplies products that help companies use energy more efficiently, such as light switches, electric-vehicle chargers and home-automation systems.
Lagarrigue's experience includes looking at "heavy emitting companies to find out what were the sources of carbon emissions and how you then attack the sources to bring carbon levels down," Agrawal said.
He added that Gailliot's previous experience leading private-capital deals in the broader clean-energy industry at investment bank Goldman Sachs would help KKR find opportunities beyond the crowded renewable-power sector. Arora, in turn, would act as a "regional specialist" in Asia, Agrawal said. Arora previously worked at infrastructure investor Macquarie Group, where he focused on renewable-energy projects in the Asia Pacific region.
Like other firms that invest in infrastructure, KKR has created a separate strategy to back businesses that seek to reduce carbon emissions because the firm sees potential for higher returns in such investments compared with conventional infrastructure operators, despite higher risks, Agrawal said. Some of those risks include supply-chain bottlenecks, delayed permit processes, power-grid congestion and community resistance to renewable-energy projects, as well as uncertainty over how quickly relatively new sectors such as electric vehicles can expand, according to fund managers and industry attorneys.
"There is definitely a different risk-return profile on clean-energy strategies compared to traditional infrastructure," said Sarah McLean, a partner at the private equity and mergers and acquisitions practice of Shearman & Sterling who also leads the law firm's U.S. energy group. "I'm not talking about wind and solar power because those are pretty mature sectors, but the new technologies."
Agrawal said KKR will seek to mitigate the uncertainties by extending to its climate strategy the same approach it has adopted for its other infrastructure investments. For example, KKR will focus on businesses that benefit from long-term contracts, while for now largely avoiding fledgling sectors, including carbon capture and hydrogen fuels.
"There is a reward for being able to step into those uncertainties. When you get it right, you will have the potential to get three, four, five times your investment." Agrawal said of climate-related deals. "It's very hard to do that with classic infrastructure investments."

Full text: Montana must do more to protect the state and its residents from climate change, a judge ruled Monday in a landmark decision that cited a state constitutional right to a clean environment.
State District Judge Kathy Seeley ruled in favor of a group of youth plaintiffs and invalidated legislation prohibiting state agencies from considering the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions.
"The degradation to Montana's environment, and the resulting harm to Plaintiffs, will worsen if the State continues ignoring GHG emissions and climate change," Seeley wrote.
The case, brought by more than a dozen Montana residents who were between 2 and 18 years old when it was filed in March 2020, is among a wave of similar suits brought by young people across the country who argue that future generations will bear the consequences of a warming planet. It was the first of its kind to go to trial, which took place in June.
A 1972 provision in Montana's constitution explicitly guarantees the right to "a clean and healthful environment," but the clause had largely gone unenforced. The plaintiffs argued the state's reliance on fossil fuels and their production was at odds with that constitutional guarantee.
The judge didn't lay out specific steps for the state to take in response to her ruling. Instead, her order opens the door for state officials to consider climate impacts in future policy decisions, including on energy and mining projects, or efficiency and emissions standards.
"Today, for the first time in U.S. history, a court ruled on the merits of a case that the government violated the constitutional rights of children through laws and actions that promote fossil fuels, ignore climate change, and disproportionately imperil young people," said Julia Olson, chief legal counsel and executive director for Our Children's Trust, the organization representing the plaintiffs. "This is a huge win for Montana, for youth, for democracy, and for our climate."
The state opposed the suit largely on procedural grounds, arguing the challenge was overly broad. It also argued that Montana's specific contribution to global greenhouse-gas emissions couldn't be identified and therefore wasn't a state responsibility to regulate.
The Montana attorney general's office said it planned to appeal, saying that Monday's ruling was "absurd" and that the trial was a "weeklong taxpayer-funded publicity stunt."
"Montanans can't be blamed for changing the climate -- even the plaintiffs' expert witnesses agreed that our state has no impact on the global climate. Their same legal theory has been thrown out of federal court and courts in more than a dozen states. It should have been here as well," said Emily Flower, spokeswoman for Republican Attorney General Austin Knudsen.
The plaintiffs included outdoor enthusiasts, athletes, Native American youth and children of farmers, who cited climate harms including extreme heat, poor air quality and damage to crops and livestock.
Similar cases are moving forward in other parts of the U.S.
Montana's Republican-majority legislature has supported fossil-fuel infrastructure in the resource-heavy region, and passed a new law this session that explicitly prohibited the analysis of greenhouse gases and climate effects in environmental-impact reviews by state agencies. That law was blocked by Monday's ruling.
Global greenhouse-gas emissions reached record levels in 2022.

Full text: SAO PAULO -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has positioned himself as a global leader in the fight against climate change, pledging at a summit of South American leaders this week to fight deforestation as part of "a new Amazonian dream."
There is a significant contradiction, environmentalists say.
Da Silva also backs plans by state-controlled oil company Petrobras to open up the Amazon to oil exploration to position Brazil as one of the world's biggest oil producers.
As other countries have tried to transition from fossil fuels, Brazil, which has 15 billion barrels of proven reserves and an economy reliant on fossil fuels, has in recent years tapped oil in the Atlantic, passing Kuwait to become the world's ninth-biggest producer, according to the Energy Institute's Statistical Review of World Energy.
By opening up new fields in the Amazon and elsewhere, the government says it hopes to make a country that is the largest producer in Latin America the world's fourth-biggest in the next decade. Of the 30 biggest global oil and gas projects approved last year or expected to get the green light this year, Brazil is home to five, ranking only below Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to Rystad Energy, a Norwegian consulting firm.
In a country that characterizes itself as a leader in the fight against deforestation, Brazil's energy ambitions raise questions about its role in heading off global warming. Like other developing countries, Brazil is struggling both with international demands to protect the world's biggest rainforest and the needs of its own people, who want economic development and prosperity.
The two-day summit of the countries that share the Amazon came to an end Wednesday in the Brazilian city of Belem without any agreement over deforestation targets. Participants also failed to reach a consensus on oil exploration, while Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whose government has stopped issuing new oil-exploration licenses, has called for a moratorium in the Amazon.
Brazilian officials say the country's future prosperity is tied to oil and gas production.
"Brazilians have the right to see the country reach its potential," Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira said on Monday before the summit. He argued that Petrobras should be allowed to prospect for oil in Brazil's Equatorial Margin, which includes the mouth of the Amazon River.
The Equatorial Margin could contain 30 billion barrels of crude and oil equivalent, matching about 70% of total U.S. reserves, the Brazilian government estimates.
Still, Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, in May rejected a request from Petrobras to drill near the mouth of the Amazon River, citing incomplete information in the company's environmental study of the area.
But da Silva said in an interview this month that Petrobras was tweaking its application to gain approval. The president said he hopes oil production will create jobs in the poor north and northeastern regions.
Environmentalists and members of da Silva's administration have expressed strong misgivings. "Even if we manage to reduce deforestation by 100%, if the world does not halt the emission of fossil fuels, we will damage the Amazon all the same," Brazilian Environment Minister Marina Silva said on Monday.

Full text: July was Earth's hottest month on record, surpassing the global monthly average temperature record set in July 2019, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a European Union-funded scientific agency. The heat blanketed parts of North America, Asia and Europe as wildfires blazed in Greece and Canada, hitting economies. Water shortages and humidity affected parts of the Middle East. Residents in China contended with both extreme flooding and a heat wave as the country set a new national temperature record. All this came on the heels of the world's hottest June on record.
Parts of the U.S. experienced record-breaking heat as well. July was the warmest month on record for states like Arizona and New Mexico, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday. Agency data also shows that more than 3,000 daily temperature records were broken or tied across the country last month. Even cities in typically colder areas like Alaska experienced unprecedentedly high temperatures.
July is always, on average, the hottest month of the year annually, but these temperature records represent merely the newest iteration of what has become a notable pattern over the past decade. The world experienced the eight warmest years on record globally from 2015 to 2022, the World Meteorological Organization reported earlier this year.
The global ocean, too, is part of this pattern: Roughly, the last 10 years were among the ocean's warmest since at least the 1800s, and the Copernicus agency, a division of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, found that global sea-surface temperatures remained at record high levels last month.
"What seems unprecedented this year now will just be normal a few years from now," said Tapio Schneider, a California Institute of Technology climate scientist.
Heat waves have become quotidian problems in the summer. And this year, much as in 2016, a powerful El Nino weather pattern developing in the Pacific has liberated heat from the ocean depths, redistributing it into the atmosphere, amplifying the effects of climate change driven by fossil-fuel emissions.
The Wall Street Journal looked at some of the cities around the world that are among those affected in different ways by rising temperatures.
Phoenix
Excessive heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service. Phoenix residents endured a record stretch of it in July, when daytime temperatures hit 110 degrees or above for 31 consecutive days -- the hottest month ever in a U.S. city. Phoenix also clocked a record 16-day stretch when the temperatures didn't go below 90 degrees at night. That nighttime heat has been responsible for a growing number of heat-related deaths.
So far this year, Maricopa County has recorded 39 heat-associated deaths and is investigating another 312, according to the most recent weekly report from the public-health department.
There were a record 425 heat-associated deaths in 2022, a 25% increase from the previous year, according to Maricopa's public-health department.
Sonia Singh, spokeswoman for Maricopa's public-health department, said it is hard to pinpoint exactly what caused the jump because so many factors can play into a heat-associated death, including a person's housing situation, substance use and access to healthcare.
"This is a lot more than we're used to," Singh said of the recent and unusually long spate of extreme temperatures. "Everybody needs to have a plan for where they can go to escape the heat."
Even places like Arizona that routinely experience extreme heat have struggled to get people to pay attention to the risks, according to Kristie Ebi, a professor who researches health risks in a changing climate at the University of Washington's Center for Health and the Global Environment.
"You talk with people who say, 'Oh, I can remember heat waves from a couple of years ago . . . I was fine,'" she said, adding, "Today's hot isn't hot five years ago -- it is a different hot and that is not easy to communicate."
Heat-related deaths in the U.S. have been on the rise for the past five years, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. The agency, on average, has recorded some 1,200 deaths each year from 2018 to 2022. The agency said that better reporting may be a factor, particularly as people have become more aware of how heat can contribute to death cases. In contrast, heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., sees hundreds of thousands of deaths recorded each year by the agency.
Ebi said the number of heat deaths is "massively underestimated," and that the real number is closer to 10,000 when factoring in people who died of things like heart issues brought on by heat.
New York
Heat has an outsize impact on urban areas. In cities like New York, where asphalt, cement and buildings absorb heat, it will not only feel hotter during the day, but also at night, when a lot of that heat is released, according to Ebi, of the University of Washington.
The compact, built-out environments of densely populated cities help create pockets known as heat islands, which experience temperatures that can be several degrees higher than surrounding rural areas. Many elements of city life contribute to this effect, including traffic, industrial facilities, and the heating and cooling of buildings.
"Think about people who have window air conditioners, and you know the way they work is they take heat from the inside and they dump it outside," Ebi said. "Air conditioners can make cities hotter as well."
More than two-thirds of residents in New York City experience at least 8 degrees Fahrenheit more heat due to the effect, according to the New Jersey-based nonprofit Climate Central.
City data on the relative risk from extreme-heat events shows that residents of the south Bronx, upper Manhattan and central Brooklyn are the most vulnerable. In Brooklyn, Borough President Antonio Reynoso said the vulnerability is largely concentrated in communities of color.
Athens
Tourists saw their vacations soured by heat waves and wildfires across the Mediterranean last month. Greece experienced a 15-day heat wave -- its longest on record, according to Lagouvardos Kostas, meteorologist and research director at the National Observatory of Athens. Temperatures as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit fried the capital, prompting city officials to intermittently close outdoor archaeological sites like the Acropolis.
"It is an open space. It is very exposed to the sun, you have to work to climb to go there too," Kostas said of the Acropolis. "It's not an easy task to do it even in fine weather."
Officials encouraged tourists and residents to limit their time outside. Some workers were given the option to telecommute rather than risk developing health conditions like heat stroke, he added. Spain and Italy were among other Mediterranean countries experiencing extreme heat -- Catania, in Sicily, saw temperatures exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit midmonth.
Europe experienced a similarly scorching and deadly summer in 2022.
There were more than 61,000 heat-related deaths on the continent between the end of May and beginning of September last year, according to a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine.
Tehran
Taps are running dry in Tehran as millions in Iran and neighboring Iraq face water shortages that are being compounded by the effects of rising temperatures.
"In Iran they are wrestling over the available water," said Charles Iceland, director for freshwater initiatives at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit. "They have been overexploiting groundwater, and they are actually using it faster than it is replenished."
Unsustainable use and management of water resources -- to sate a growing population and economy -- and inefficient irrigation practices have contributed to scarcity, Iceland said. Roughly 80% of water use goes to agriculture, according to Soroosh Sorooshian, a University of California, Irvine, professor of civil and environmental engineering, who grew up in Iran.
Farmers generally flood their land using open-air canals, and much of the water is lost to evaporation. And as temperatures continue to rise, Iceland said, more of that irrigation water will be lost to evaporation. He added that mid-latitude regions including Iran and Iraq are projected to get less rainfall over time as the Earth continues to warm.
A combination of high heat and humidity is an additional issue for the region's beleaguered population. While temperature highs haven't exceeded those of Europe and the southern U.S., researchers say subtropical regions near warm water, including the Middle East, are less hospitable even at the same temperatures. High humidity levels make it more difficult to sweat out excess body heat.
Beijing
In recent weeks, residents in China's capital and surrounding areas have been hit by a one-two punch of extreme heat and deadly flooding from record rainfall following Typhoon Doksuri.
The occurrence, intensity and duration of such events, research shows, are affected by climate change. Rising temperatures result in increased precipitation. Ultimately the unpredictability of these events makes it harder to manage water, energy and other critical resources in a heavily urbanized country where people and valuable assets are densely clustered, according to Scott Moore, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist and director of China programs and strategic initiatives at the university.
"There is a good argument that, of the world's large economies, China is the most vulnerable to climate risk," Moore said. An April study published in the journal Nature Communications identified the area around Beijing as being among the most at-risk for high-impact heat waves.
The aftermath of Doksuri forced more than a million people in Beijing and surrounding areas to evacuate. Meanwhile, consistently high temperatures strained electrical grids and exacerbated water shortages.
A July report from China's National Climate Center showed the rate of the country's temperature rise has been higher than the rest of the world's since the beginning of the 20th century. Extreme high temperature events have increased in frequency and intensity in about the past six decades, as well as a per-decade increase in China's average annual precipitation during the same period. Indeed, the biggest threat to Beijing, Moore said, is extreme rainfall that overwhelms the capital's drainage system.
Utqiagvik, Alaska
Even the Arctic isn't immune to rising temperatures.
The U.S.'s northernmost city, Utqiagvik -- formerly known as Barrow -- north of the Arctic Circle in Alaska just experienced its hottest July on record. Typically, summer temperatures hover between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, but on July 23, the daily average temperature hit a record high of 63.5 degrees. That record was just broken again, as the average temperature there on Saturday hit 66 degrees, according to Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist at the National Weather Service Alaska region headquarters.
"It used to be normal to have a couple inches of snow up there in July," he said of Utqiagvik. Other cities around the state, like Northway, also had their warmest months on record in July. "The last two months have really been kind of big steps up" in a long-term, ongoing warming trend worldwide, Brettschneider said.
Not only does data show Alaska is the fastest warming state due to climate change, but its North Slope is among the fast-warming areas on Earth, Brettschneider said. "It is safe to say the Arctic warms at least twice as fast as the rest of the world," he added.
Loss of surrounding sea ice due to rising surface and ocean temperatures has decreased surfaces that act like a mirror for incoming heat from the sun, reflecting solar energy back into space, Brettschneider said. Now more of it is absorbed by the ocean, which further heats up and contributes to more ice melt as part of a feedback loop. Such ice melt can affect global ocean circulation, and the additional heat filters into the atmosphere, where it gets transported to lower latitudes, affecting sea levels and weather systems.
"Warmth in Alaska doesn't stay in Alaska," he said.

Full text: SAO PAULO -- The Latin American countries that share the Amazon rainforest embarked on a two-day meeting Tuesday in the Brazilian jungle city of Belem with an aim to halt the deforestation that many scientists blame for accelerating climate change.
Brazil, home to 60% of the world's biggest rainforest, held a meeting for presidents and top officials from countries that are home to the rest of the Amazon: Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Guyana and Suriname. The summit is the first in 14 years for the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, a group that arose from a treaty Amazonian nations signed in 1978 to promote harmonious development of the region. France, which oversees French Guiana on South America's northeast shoulder, was represented by the French ambassador in Brasilia.
The meeting comes as Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva seeks to position his country as a leading voice in the global fight against deforestation, and facilitator of cross-border environmental cooperation on the continent through the 45-year-old treaty.
"It's never been more urgent to resume and widen this cooperation -- it's the challenge of our era," said da Silva in his opening speech Tuesday.
Other countries with large tropical forests, such as Indonesia, Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, were expected to join the meeting along with Norway and Germany, which contribute to deforestation programs. The United Arab Emirates, which will host this year's United Nations climate summit in Dubai, was also to attend.
Twice the size of India, the Amazon rainforest has long absorbed more carbon than it releases, acting as a vital brake on global climate change. But with close to 20% of the original forest now gone, scientists tracking the forest say the Amazon could now be close to its so-called irreversible tipping point, at which it would dry out and eventually become savanna. The effects could be global. Climate scientists have blamed forest loss for contributing to global warming, which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said explains why heat waves in countries such as the U.S. are becoming more common.
Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon has hit its lowest level in four years since da Silva's administration started in January, dropping about 34% in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, according to preliminary data from Brazil's National Institute of Space Research, known as INPE. While da Silva has vowed to bring jungle destruction down to zero by 2030, he has argued that this can't be done at the cost of the livelihoods of the some 30 million people who live in Brazil's Amazon.
Instead, Brazil must build a new green economy in the Amazon with financing and investment from abroad, da Silva argues, as well as developa regulated carbon market. Brazil relies on foreign donations to help operate its underfunded environmental enforcement agencies, which use helicopters, drones and other equipment to monitor illegal deforestation across the vast area.
"What we want is to tell the world what we're going to do with our forests and what the world has to do to help us," da Silva said. He said he plans to pressure wealthy nations to fulfill the pledge they made during the 2015 Paris climate accord to provide $100 billion a year to help developing countries fight climate change.
Such a summit seemed a distant possibility just a year ago, when da Silva's right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro was president. Bolsonaro, who jokingly referred to himself as "Captain Chainsaw," cut funding for environmental enforcement and bristled at attempts from foreign nations to influence his stewardship of the Amazon even as he called on them to fund deforestation efforts.

Full text: TEHRAN -- Neighborhoods across Iran's capital fell quiet Wednesday as temperatures topping 100 degrees bore down on the city.
Many residents stayed home after the government declared an emergency two-day shutdown, closing banks, exchange shops and government offices, and calling on private businesses to follow suit. In the north, roads leading out of the city to cooler regions were clogged with people seeking relief from the heat.
The national holiday, announced Tuesday, is an unusual response to the increasingly frequent heat waves hitting the country, which in the south have pushed temperatures above 120 degrees.
The health ministry advised children, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions to stay indoors. Other government departments pleaded with people to consume less electricity and refrain from using power-hungry devices except in the morning and late at night to ensure there was enough power to go around for Iran's nearly 90 million people.
Residents with holiday homes in the hills north of the capital and along the Caspian Sea bundled into cars after the two-day special holiday was announced. Grocery stores, restaurants and shopping malls largely stayed open, though traffic within Tehran was less than usual.
In a region scorched by global warming, Iran is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is dominated by an arid and semiarid climate, marked by low rain and snowfall.
While U.S. sanctions to some extent hamper Iran's ability to mitigate the impact of global warming, successive governments have failed to invest in climate initiatives such as solar energy or more efficient agricultural technology. In the winter, when a lid of cold air captures the smog, Tehran is enveloped in a yellow haze emanating from antiquated cars belching exhaust.
Iranian authorities have warned that the western lake of Urmia, which was once the Middle East's largest lake but has been shrinking since the mid-1990s, is at risk of fully drying up if dam construction and other agricultural projects aren't halted. The Iranian government has dug a 20-mile tunnel to transfer water into the lake from a nearby basin.
Iran faces a conundrum, however, with dams and irrigation projects vital to assisting a struggling agricultural sector that has lost billions of dollars to the shocks of climate change.
In a climate zone like Iran's, each one-degree increase in temperature can reduce crop production by 10%, according to the United Nations.
The rest of Iran's economy -- hampered by U.S. sanctions -- is ill-equipped to adapt. In the year to March 2022, power outages cost the country $7 billion to $8 billion in non-oil exports, according to the country's Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture.

Full text: EBRO DELTA, Spain -- So much seawater is seeping into the paddy fields of this rice-growing region that Montserrat Servulo is considering replacing at least some of the crop with seaweed and clams.
"There is too much salt here," said the 56-year-old farmer, standing on the edge of a field where she grew rice until last year. It is now filled with patchy grass and mud. "Last year wasn't a good year, but at least we had something."
Rising sea levels, dry spells and heat waves are disrupting food production in the Mediterranean, a region whose diet is regarded as a cultural treasure.
This year, prolonged drought and the scorching heat have hit agricultural production especially hard, wreaking havoc from the olive groves of Spain to the wheat fields of Algeria, reducing yields and pushing farmers to consider switching to hardier crops.
The recent heat wave has affected food production in other ways, too. Cows are producing less milk and bees are less willing to forage for pollen, with honey production down 70% compared with last year in Italy, according to Coldiretti, the country's agricultural trade association.
The climate is changing faster in the Mediterranean than in most places on Earth. Average temperatures here have risen by about 1.5 degrees Celsius since the dawn of the industrial age, more than in all other regions except the Arctic. The problems farmers face in the Mediterranean offer a preview into the challenges of feeding a hotter planet.
The Ebro Delta, where paddy fields are spread over about 20,000 hectares, is so vulnerable because it is coming under the pressures of rising sea levels and drought. Seawater from the Mediterranean is reaching deeper inland than it used to, and there isn't enough freshwater from the Ebro River to flush out the excess salt from the fields. Because of a prolonged drought, the river was running so dry this year that, for the first time, the water supply to the delta was interrupted for long periods.
The result is what some farmers here say is shaping up as the worst harvest they have seen. "If we manage to harvest 30% of what we did last year, it will be a lot," says Servulo, who grows rice varieties used to make beer, breakfast cereal and paella.
Short-term solutions include processing more wastewater and covering up canals to limit how much water evaporates. Creating buffer zones to counter coastal erosion, such as through artificial beaches, also could help. But that won't solve the problem everywhere.
Scientists aren't optimistic. The latest report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the effects of global warming in the Mediterranean Sea's coastal countries are likely to intensify in the coming decades.
Scientists at IRTA, the Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology of Spain's Catalonia region, are helping farmers adapt to climate change, including by studying fish, seaweed and clam varieties best suited to replace paddy fields in the Ebro Delta wetlands.
"We are developing the technology so that when there is need, we can easily transfer it. We need to have data from two-three years of production cycles to show [farmers] it's a credible, feasible opportunity. If not, they will abandon these areas," said Enric Gisbert, who oversees the aquaculture division of IRTA. "What is happening here will probably happen in other deltas of the Mediterranean."
In Algeria and Morocco, fields of wheat, barley and other staple crops along the country's Mediterranean coast have turned yellow well before harvest time, dried out by a persistent lack of rainfall.
"There is no water. We can't work," said Mohammed Bahout, 80, whose family grows wheat and barley west of Algiers.
Some are trying to make the most of the changing climate. In southern Italy, farmers are growing tropical fruit such as mangoes. The cultivation of fruits such as bananas, mangoes and avocados has increased threefold in Italy over the past five years, and now covers some 1,200 hectares of farmland in Italy's southernmost regions of Sicily, Calabria and Puglia, according to Coldiretti.
In the Languedoc wine country in southern France, vineyards have been stifled by months of drought and now a heat wave.
"We have rarely seen a period this long without rain," said Christophe Bousquet, president of Languedoc's wine growers group. "The grapes aren't very pretty."
Languedoc wine growers are searching for ways to protect their livelihood from the growing impacts of climate change. Bousquet, who owns a vineyard in La Clape, a territory on the Mediterranean, is allowing the grass to grow around his vines to hold more moisture in the soil when it does rain. They also are looking into planting different grape varieties that can better withstand drought and heat. That is a risky change, Bousquet said, and new vines take years to grow -- time he says they don't have.
"The problem is, time is against us," he said. "The evolution of the climate in the Mediterranean is happening much faster than anticipated."

Full text: Roads, bridges and train tracks built to the design standards of the 20th century are buckling from extreme heat gripping the globe. Power grids, buildings and cooling systems are under strain.
Design standards have failed to keep up with a warming climate, say engineering and construction experts who are pushing their clients to invest in solutions to make existing buildings cooler while factoring in the cost of future heat waves.
"The U.S. isn't prepared for what we've had so far, let alone more of it," said Adam Jaffe, senior materials engineer at Arup, a global design and architecture firm, about extreme heat.
Throughout July, record-setting temperatures have broiled the southern half of the U.S., southern Europe, central China and eastern Asia. The heat has caused scattered power outages in several countries and buckled roads in Utah, Louisiana and Wisconsin, according to local news reports. In Texas, a section of Interstate 10 in Houston and a six-lane state highway south of the city ruptured during 100-plus-degree heat in late June.
As roadways absorb heat, asphalt -- which is used on more than 90% of U.S. roads -- begins to melt and deform, forming bumps and ripples on the road surface. This leads to a rougher ride, more fuel consumption, more emissions and higher vehicle-maintenance costs, according to Imad Al-Qadi, director of the Illinois Center for Transportation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
On concrete highways, steel joints designed to allow the surfaces to expand to prevent cracking can fail if the roadway gets too hot.
Buckled roads are relatively easy to spot and fix, but the effects of heat on buildings, pipes and electrical structures are less evident. Extreme heat wears down buildings over time and can lead to big repair bills, according to Elaine Gallagher Adams, an architect and net zero facilities solutions leader at Arcadis, a design and consulting firm.
Sealants, glues and other polymer-based adhesives that hold together pipes, windows and structural joints are the materials most vulnerable to heat, she said. When they crack, it can lead to water leaks.
Temperatures experienced by polymer sealants might be substantially higher than the air temperature. For example, if it is 120 degrees outside, certain building facades exposed to sun might reach 180 degrees, and the sealants will likely be somewhere in between, said Jaffe.
Extreme heat also poses risks to metal and concrete materials used during construction.
In Phoenix, three weeks of 110-degree plus temperatures are expanding steel plates and iron girders used in building projects across the region, according to Reymundo Hernandez, a field representative for the Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers Local 3, which represents trade union workers in Arizona and New Mexico.
That makes it more difficult for workers to set beams into concrete blocks and walls, and could lead to problems later on, Hernandez said. "When you are setting beams into concrete, and it's so hot right now that they swell more, then you get cracks in the walls."
The extreme heat has led some builders to add buckets of ice to concrete and mortar to help it set properly. They schedule pours at night, when the temperature gets down to the mid-90s, according to Matt Gilliland, risk manager for Phoenix-based Willmeng Construction. "We are adapting," he said.
Joints that hold bridges together also expand during heat, making construction and repair work tricky. "Those things can move a couple inches on the weather," Gilliland said. "You may fit it up in the morning, and when the time is ready to set it, you may have a problem in the afternoon."
Architects say glass-and-steel skyscrapers are particularly unsuited to cope with rising global temperatures. They are often poorly insulated and require massive cooling systems that will need to be upgraded as outdoor temperatures rise.
Glass-facade buildings also reflect sunlight and contribute to the urban heat island effect, a phenomenon where buildings, roads and other surfaces absorb and re-emit the sun's heat.
To keep air conditioners running during future extreme heat events, researchers say the systems will have to become more energy-efficient.
Adapting to climate change leaves businesses, utilities and property owners with some tough and expensive choices, according to George Karagiannis, an expert in engineering and critical infrastructure at Resilience First, a business network based in London.
One recent study found that increased extreme heat across the U.K. and Europe could boost yearly operational and maintenance costs to roads and rail systems up to $5.4 billion by 2100, depending on how much the atmosphere warms.
Karagiannis said it would be too expensive to update all the infrastructure that isn't equipped to deal with extreme heat and other threats posed by climate change. Instead, he said, policy makers and companies will have to build better systems for responding to and recovering from weather emergencies while giving priority to the most urgent retrofits.

STUDY PINS EXTREME HEAT ON CLIMATE CHANGE
The extreme heat blanketing the southern regions of the U.S., Mexico, and Europe would have been nearly impossible without the warming effects of human-induced climate change, according to a study released Tuesday by a group of European scientists who carry out rapid assessments of extreme weather events.
The study by World Weather Attribution found that three separate heat waves in July across the Northern Hemisphere were made much worse because of decades of fossil-fuel emissions that have raised the planet's average temperature by 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century.
"It's something that we definitely will see more of in the future," said Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute in London.
The study hasn't been peer-reviewed, considered the gold standard for validating research findings; however, it is based on peer-reviewed methods the group published in 2020.
The scientists ran a dozen climate models comparing temperatures observed this month with projections of a similar world without climate warming. They concluded that without human-induced climate change, the extreme heat in China would have been about a 1-in-250-year event, while the heat in the U.S., Mexico, and southern Europe would have been virtually impossible.

Full text: Under cover of darkness, several climate protesters made their way onto a golf green in southern Spain earlier this month and filmed themselves pouring cement into a hole.
They targeted 10 golf courses in all, notoriously large consumers of water in the arid climate. Some protesters planted flowers and vegetables. Others unfurled signs reading "Golf closed for climate justice" or "Water is a common good."
After years of petitions and rallies, rising numbers of climate activists are turning to direct action, sometimes flouting laws or sparking safety concerns as they put across their message that governments need to do more to cut emissions as temperatures creep up toward record highs this summer. Many risk jail.
In England, they have disrupted sports events such as Wimbledon and the snooker world championships by leaping onto courts or tables to fling orange confetti or powder, disrupting play. Two women threw cans of Heinz tomato soup across Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers" at the National Gallery in London. (It was protected by a layer of glass.) At the Open championship on Friday, American golfer Billy Horschel helped remove a protester at the 17thhole of the Royal Liverpool course.
Greta Thunberg was detained protesting a coal mine in Germany earlier this year, while climate activists in the U.S. have turned off the valves on gas pipelines from Canada and climbed the smoke stacks of coal-fired power plants in New England to shut them down.
This week, an heir to the Disney fortune, Abigail Disney, was arrested in the Hamptons with several other activists for blockading an airfield used by private jets.
Among the more unusual groups is the Tyre Extinguishers, who have made it their mission to sneak up on fuel-hungry SUVs around Europe and let the air out of their tires to discourage people from buying them. More than 10,000 vehicles have been disabled in this way, at least temporarily.
These vigilante tactics have triggered a debate among environmentalists over whether such protests might be doing more harm than good by antagonizing the people they need to bring on board -- something academics call the activist's dilemma.
Swedish university professor Andreas Malm, whose book "How to Blow Up a Pipeline" was recently adapted into a movie, first began deflating SUV tires with other activists in 2007. He thinks the trend is clearly toward bolder, brasher stunts in a bid to shock people out of their complacency, and that in many instances acts of sabotage are justified.
"Among younger climate activists there is a feeling that what we've done so far isn't enough," he said.
There is a fine line to tread, however. Blocking roads and other indiscriminate action irritates people who simply need to get to work or home, Malm said.
When activists blocked the M25 motorway that circles London two years ago, causing huge traffic delays, a poll conducted by the U.K.'s YouGov found 59% of respondents opposed the protest. Larger campaign groups such as Extinction Rebellion have mostly turned their focus away from direct action toward mobilizing large demonstrations as groups such as Just Stop Oil and the Tyre Extinguishers come to the fore with their commando-style tactics.
Heather Alberro, a lecturer at Nottingham Trent University in England, argues that history shows that sometimes radical movements can help advance more-moderate protest campaigns. Militant suffragettes, by destroying property, made the suffragists' campaign to grant women the vote seem less alarming in comparison.
Protesters, for their part, increasingly risk jail time to make their point.
In April, an English court sentenced Morgan Trowland, a civil engineer, to three years in prison and activist Marcus Decker to two years and seven months for climbing up the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge spanning the River Thames to unfurl a "Just Stop Oil" banner.
Before sentencing, Trowland said he and Decker were taking a stand against any new oil or gas wells being drilled. "I will not be complicit in that," he said.
New laws restricting protests in England, described by Home Secretary Suella Braverman as a necessary measure to counter what she called the "tofu-eating wokerati," suggest more protesters could end up in prison.

Full text: TAIPEI -- Beijing's warm embrace of Henry Kissinger this week sent a pointed signal to the Biden administration: Stop trying to contain us.
On Thursday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping welcomed Richard Nixon's secretary of state to Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, lavishing gratitude on the 100-year-old for his role in normalizing diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China half a century ago.
Video footage from China's state broadcaster showed the pair meeting in the same building where, in July 1971, Kissinger first met China's then-Premier Zhou Enlai for secret talks to discuss re-establishing diplomatic ties. Xi praised the "splendid strategic vision" of that past diplomatic effort, adding: "We'll never forget our old friend."
Kissinger's reception in Beijing, which included a meeting with China's defense minister who snubbed his current American counterpart this summer, was markedly different from that of the White House's climate envoy, John Kerry, who was seeking to revive cooperation on climate change.
Kerry, himself a former secretary of state under Barack Obama, was, like Kissinger, described by senior Chinese officials as "an old friend." Unlike Kissinger, he didn't get a meeting with Xi.
Instead, Xi attended a separate forum on climate change, where he said China would pursue its own climate goals "free from outside interference."
"We were aware that Henry Kissinger was traveling to China," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told a news briefing on Tuesday. "He was there under his own volition, not acting on behalf of the United States government."
The Kissinger trip, and its contrast with Kerry's sojourn, highlights the two-pronged approach Beijing has taken when it comes to repairing badly fractured ties with the U.S. While accepting Washington's entreaties to re-engage, it is pushing to do so on its own terms, with Americans that it regards as trustworthy.
In June, as the U.S. and China were gearing up to revive high-level contacts cut off after President Biden ordered a suspected Chinese spy balloon shot down, Xi met in Beijing with Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Xi told Gates, whose company has a long history in China, that he was the first American he had seen that year. A Chinese official said Xi, who would meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken days later, wanted to ensure he met with a friendlier American beforehand.
During Thursday's meeting with Kissinger at Diaoyutai's Villa No. 5, Xi said relations between the U.S. and China had -- five decades after Kissinger's first visit -- once again reached a crossroads.
"I hope you and other insightful Americans will continue to play a constructive role in bringing U.S.-China relations back on the right track," Xi told Kissinger.
According to a Chinese state-media account, Kissinger emphasized the importance to Beijing of what it calls the "one-China principle," referring to Beijing's claim over democratically self-ruled Taiwan -- and indirectly rebuking the Biden administration for tightening ties with the government in Taipei.
Potentially more consequential was Kissinger's meeting on Tuesday with Li Shangfu, China's defense minister. The meeting came about a month after Li bluntly declined a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at an annual security forum in Singapore, despite a U.S. push to improve military-to-military communication with China.
The U.S. has argued that better communication is necessary to avoid a catastrophic misunderstanding between the militaries. China has dismissed the request as insincere. It also pointed to sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Li since 2018, when he ran the Chinese military's armaments departments and purchased combat aircraft and missile equipment from Russia.

Full text: VENEZUELA
Ex-Spy Chief
Is Sent to U.S.
Hugo Carvajal, a former Venezuelan spy chief long wanted by the U.S. on charges that he collaborated with narco-terrorists to traffic cocaine, was extradited on Wednesday to the U.S. from Spain, according to the Justice Department.
Carvajal, a confidant of President Hugo Chavez until the former leader's death in 2013, could provide U.S. prosecutors with information on figures in Venezuela's authoritarian regime involved in cocaine-smuggling, corruption and money laundering, people familiar with his case say.
Carvajal, 63 years old, known as "El Pollo," or "The Chicken," because of his long neck, has repeatedly denied the U.S.'s allegations, calling them politically motivated. He is expected to appear before a magistrate court at the Southern District of New York on Thursday and plead not guilty, said his defense lawyer, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma.
Since 2019, Carvajal had been in Madrid fighting extradition proceedings after breaking from Chavez's successor, President Nicolas Maduro.

CHINA
Kerry Winds Up
Climate Talks
John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy on climate, concluded talks in China that pushed forward the two powers' tentative effort to reset fraught ties and tested Beijing's willingness to find common ground on fighting climate change.
Kerry saw a parade of high-level Chinese officials and spent long hours in closed-door meetings with his counterpart during his three days in Beijing.
Both sides came away citing a readiness for future discussions on climate change after nearly a year of little contact due to Beijing's anger with Washington over Taiwan, technology and other issues.
"We came here to unstick what had been stuck," Kerry told reporters Wednesday. "And indeed, we did succeed."
While both sides agreed to future collaboration, Kerry said, they couldn't finalize all the details. Nor did he get an audience with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who instead attended a conference on environmental protection and sent a signal on Beijing's limits for engagement.

Full text: SINGAPORE -- Temperatures in a Chinese village hit a searing 126 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest ever recorded in the country, on the same day that U.S. climate envoy John Kerry arrived in Beijing to try to revive stalled cooperation on climate change between the world's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide.
The record was set Sunday in Sanbao, a remote township in China's northwestern Xinjiang region, according to state media.
Heat waves have been ravaging the globe in recent days. Last week was the Earth's hottest week on record, and followed the hottest June on record. China is particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures as climate change accelerates, Chinese officials have warned. Annual temperatures in China rose by an average of 0.16 degrees Celsius every decade since the start of last century, faster than the global average, says this year's Blue Book on Climate Change of China published by China's Meteorological Association this month.
Chinese media haven't reported any human deaths from this heat wave but said more than 4,000 chickens and 462 pigs perished in the heat last week after power failures.
The Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting global warming since the preindustrial era to well under 2 degrees Celsius and preferably to 1.5 degrees. Climate experts warn that it is likely global temperatures will breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold, and that mitigating the worst effects of climate change will require the U.S. and China to work together.
Climate talks between the U.S. and China stopped after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan last summer but were revived three months later. Kerry is expected to spend three days in Beijing in an effort to reboot climate cooperation between Beijing and Washington on several pressing issues, including the reduction of coal use and emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that escapes during gas and oil production. The two sides also are expected to discuss technical issues to prepare the ground before the next climate summit, in Dubai at the end of the year.
Some experts say the recent heat waves might stem in part from El Nino, a climate pattern caused by warming of ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, which could lead to a surge in global temperatures and disruptive weather and climate patterns.

Full text: Heat waves stretching across large parts of the globe are straining power grids and shutting businesses that can't keep their workers cool. Some of the hardest-hit areas will face hotter temperatures in the coming days, forecasters say, adding to risks that infrastructure will fail.
More than 100 million Americans are being affected by the heat barrage, according to the National Weather Service. A streak of 110-degree days is frying Phoenix, and an unrelenting heat wave is punishing Texas and other parts of the South.
Extreme heat swept across Southern Europe, with temperatures hitting triple digits in Italy, Spain and Greece. More than a dozen Italian cities, including Rome and Florence, have been put under a red alert for extreme heat, and authorities in Athens closed the Parthenon as temperatures topped 100 degrees.
Researchers studying the impact of recent heat waves found they can cut economic growth.
There are "pretty clear signals that the warmer years are associated with lower output," said Derek Lemoine, an economist at the University of Arizona who studies the economic consequences of climate change. Excess heat hurts labor productivity and can harm learning capabilities in school since "people aren't using their brains as well in the heat," he said.
A 2018 study of the impact of rising temperatures on the U.S. economy published in the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking found that a one-degree Fahrenheit increase in the average summer temperature can reduce the annual growth rate of a state's output by 0.15 to 0.25 percentage point.
So far there have been few indications of catastrophic breakdowns in the power grid or elsewhere, an indication authorities had been able to manage through the extreme temperatures. The burden is falling on small businesses and individuals.
In Burger Fresh & More in Conroe, Texas, the air conditioner broke in June with the arrival of triple-digit heat. The temperature soared to 118 degrees in the kitchen. Workers relied on cooling towels and fans with misters to stay open while a new system was installed at a cost of $12,450.
"We had to get a small-business loan to cover it because we're just a little bitty company," said manager Karen Swearingen.
Governments are trying to limit the human toll of the heat. But they are constrained by the hot weather itself, which limits the ability of workers to help people in need.
The heat wave is testing the aging U.S. electric grid, which is being asked to deliver more power for running air conditioners without much of a break for routine maintenance. A forecast from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a nonprofit that monitors the health of the bulk power system, says large portions of the U.S. could face blackouts this summer.
"Power lines can carry just a certain amount of current through them, and it's basically heat limited," said Kyri Baker, assistant professor of architectural engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. "If they heat up too much they start to sag. If they sag they can do things like touch a tree and cause a short, in addition to just being less efficient and having more losses."
The National Energy Assistance Directors Association estimates home energy bills will rise 11.7% to an average of $578 this summer, up from $517 last summer.
Mary Swindell, who runs outdoor dog-training classes in Boyd, Texas, said she has had to cancel at least half her lessons because many of the dogs can't handle heat. "Emotionally they shut down because they're too hot and too uncomfortable to work and focus," she said.
Swindell estimates her business, Dancing Dogs, has lost around $3,000 in revenue from the canceled classes, which is about half of what she had expected to make.
For the past few years, the average global temperatures have been moderated by the cooling effects of a three-year La Nina weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean. Now the Pacific is switching to its opposite pattern, known as El Nino, which brings warm water to the eastern Pacific and influences weather patterns across the globe.
Last month was the world's hottest June in the 174-year global climate record tracked by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. Early July saw the world's warmest days on record, according to daily temperatures NOAA and the University of Maine began tracking in 1979.
Extreme heat can trigger irrational behavior that can add up economically, said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School and author of "Climate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet."
"Car crashes go up, road rages go up, domestic violence and assaults go up," he said.
Tamy Jaramillo had to close her Blanding, Utah, restaurant after she spent too long working at the grill and got overheated.
Even with the air conditioner blowing, the kitchen at her restaurant, Yak's Cafe, can become unbearable, she said.
"It kicks your ass," she said.

Full text: The Environmental Protection Agency is launching a national green bank, starting the process of doling out $27 billion in funds from last year's climate law to help low-income communities address climate change.
The funding is a little-noticed but important piece of the climate law because it is one of the only programs explicitly directing money to poor communities that are some of the most vulnerable to climate change. This cash is seen as critical for funding key areas such as battery storage, electric-car charging and building upgrades that often struggle to attract private-sector funding, particularly in low-income areas.
"This money will ensure that those who have not been able to participate will now be able to participate in the clean-energy transition," EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in an interview. The EPA is racing to award the money by September 2024, its deadline for allocating it.
Green banks aren't actually banks. They are government-backed investment funds that work with the private sector to finance clean-energy projects. They typically use loans, loan guarantees and other forms of debt financing to attract outside investors. Some of the biggest winners from the program could be private financiers that will get to invest in climate projects that are less risky thanks to the government funding and other subsidies.
The EPA is preparing to award $20 billion in green-bank funding to a few national nonprofits that will distribute it to a network of local groups, the agency said Friday. The remaining $7 billion will be awarded in a state solar program targeting poor communities announced last month.
States such as New York have had green funds for years, crediting them with kick-starting projects such as community solar arrays -- which allow a city's residents to buy solar power from centrally owned panels -- until Wall Street was comfortable funding them. The U.K.'s green fund was so successful that Australian bank Macquarie bought it for nearly $3 billion in 2017.
Because the funds have the freedom to pick what projects to finance and use loans that are repaid with interest to grow their cash over time, they are some of the most open-ended programs created by the climate law.
One of the favorites to receive some of the cash is the Coalition for Green Capital, which operates as the American Green Bank Consortium and has advocated for green funds for more than a decade. It recently helped set one up in Minnesota and has about 40 state and local green funds in its network. Others who have said they would apply include the Justice Climate Fund, which is led by organizations representing minority communities.
Skeptics of the green fund program say it isn't necessary on top of the tidal wave of tax credits, loans and grants created by recent laws. Proponents say it is critical because the other programs won't go to poorer Americans.

Full text: Insurers are caught in the crossfire of an escalating battle over climate change.
The biggest U.S. insurance firms are facing pressure from three sides. They are raising premiums and are cutting back coverage because of more-damaging storms and wildfires, made worse by climate change. They insure the fossil-fuel producers whose products are blamed for causing climate change. And, as big investors, they fund these same companies. Most try to promote their climate bona fides.
This is a recipe for making lots of powerful people unhappy. Texas lawmakers want to ensure that insurance companies "do not hinder" oil companies. Connecticut lawmakers want the opposite.
Republican state attorneys general accuse insurers of going too far in the fight against climate change. Democratic senators are asking if the companies are going far enough.
"We're caught right in the middle between these very different agendas," said David Sampson, head of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, an industry group. "What we're seeing is the weaponization of the business of insurance . . . to [try to] achieve certain public policy objectives."
Adding to their stress, many insurance companies are struggling with losses because of severe weather, inflation, supply-chain bottlenecks and other factors.
They are pushing up rates significantly for some types of coverage.
Public Citizen, a consumer group, called Farmers Insurance's move this week to restrict sales of homeowners policies in California and Florida a "prime example of the insurance industry's hypocrisy on climate change."
Activists say insurers are giving priority to short-term profits from fossil fuels over their concern for the planet. "The claims by the insurance industry that they are addressing climate change is like tobacco companies saying they care about peoples' health," said Tom Swan, executive director of Connecticut Citizen Action Group.
Insurers counter that they shouldn't be forced to deny coverage to legitimate companies, said Sampson of the industry group.
The reasons for the pullback from home insurance are more complicated than simply an increase in bad weather driven by climate change, he added, saying there is "runaway lawsuit abuse" in Florida and a regulatory "dysfunctional marketplace" in California.
A Farmers spokesman declined to comment.
Allstate, which recently stopped offering new home-insurance policies in California, says climate change poses three main risks for it as a company: higher losses, a drop in the value of investments in exposed sectors such as oil and gas, and reputational risk. "Climate change matters deeply to internal and external stakeholders," the insurer's website says.
Eric Francia, chief executive of the Philippine energy company ACEN, said insurance costs for its former coal plant more than quadrupled over the past four to five years.
ACEN in November sold the plant in a deal that commits to cutting its 50-year operating life in half. Since then, "We are getting significantly more interest from insurers," he said.
Many overseas insurers are restricting coverage for oil and gas projects, although few U.S. insurers apply such curbs. An exception is Chubb's demand this year that oil and gas producers cut methane emissions.
Such initiatives are coming under criticism from the campaign by conservatives against financial firms' use of environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, criteria.
The campaign began against mutual funds that used these criteria to pick stocks. For insurers, the situation is more complicated since the risks they face are more concrete.
A new Texas law bars insurers from charging different rates based on ESG factors alone. But it still allows them to charge more where there is a higher risk "that may be tied to climate," such as locating an oil refinery on the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast, said Tom Oliverson, the Republican chair of the Texas House Insurance Committee.
Some blue states appear headed in the opposite direction.
A Connecticut bill this year proposed a 5% surcharge on "any premium payments from any fossil fuel company" to any insurer licensed in the state. The proposed legislation hasn't gone to a vote.
California holds a unique place in the debate. The state is a leader in addressing climate change, but insurers say that distinction has made it hard for them to raise rates to address the risk of wildfires. Several major insurers have quit the state after suffering big losses.
Michael Soller, deputy insurance commissioner, says California "recognizes the impact of climate change" and is spending billions of dollars to try to reduce the wildfire risk.

Full text: Jia Tolentino writing in the New Yorker, July 10:
It may be impossible to seriously consider the reality of climate change for longer than ninety seconds without feeling depressed, angry, guilty, grief-stricken, or simply insane. . . .
A couple of years ago, reading a climate report on my phone in the early hours of the morning, I went into a standard-issue emotional spiral thinking about it all. I woke up my boyfriend, seeking consolation; he took in my frenetic wheel-spinning and went back to sleep. The next morning, he drew up a list of thirty action items for us to consider, ranging from phone banking to ceasing international travel to committing eco-sabotage. There were tasks on the list that we had been doing for years -- composting food waste, buying secondhand -- but many that we had never considered. We had also recently had a baby, whose carbon footprint likely already exceeded that of entire villages in Burundi. I was playing whack-a-mole with my consumer desires. Every day, I felt like a self-serving piece of s -- .
...I also spoke with psychologists, activists, and others about what are sometimes called "climate emotions," in an effort to consider the principles of climate therapy. I was drawn to the idea that the right kind of therapist could channel such emotions in a way that prompted serious and sustained efforts to combat climate change. I was also wary of the possibility that a therapist would simply dispel those feelings, helping me to feel more calm about a world on fire. If the goal is for the planet to remain habitable into the next century, what is the right degree of panic, and how do you bear it?

Full text: Business insurance has been roiled by severe weather and inflation, the same forces disrupting home insurance markets in catastrophe-prone areas of the U.S., with companies facing tougher conditions as they try to insure their properties against disaster.
The problem of how -- or even if -- properties can be insured in areas at risk of wildfires, hurricanes and other damaging weather has come to the fore as several insurance companies have in recent weeks stopped writing new home insurance policies in California and elsewhere. The U.S. Treasury Department last month warned that climate risk poses a major challenge to the insurance industry.
Insurers face similar headwinds in trying to cover businesses in those areas, and companies are facing mounting costs and more onerous questions at policy renewal time. Kilroy Realty, a developer, has had to turn to about 40 separate insurers to try to cobble together sufficient coverage for its portfolio of office buildings, said Scott Ritto, a vice president at the company.
"The insurance increase is something that is incredible," said Ritto, who also serves as president of the Los Angeles chapter of the risk professional society RIMS. "It's definitely a very volatile situation."
The size of policies that insurers are willing to write for businesses is lower than it has been for decades, and companies are having to take extra steps to try to win over insurers by touting their efforts to mitigate against loss, said James "Chip" Stuart, leader of the real-estate specialty practice at broker HUB International.
Educational institutions with their often sprawling campuses are also major insurance buyers. Colleges in southeast Louisiana are facing "severe pressure" with costs related to flood insurance, said Peter Waggonner, the public policy director for economic development agency Greater New Orleans Inc.
The cause of the trouble facing Kilroy, the colleges and other organizations is relatively straightforward. "Losses are going up," said Steve Bowen, a meteorologist who serves as chief science officer at reinsurance broker Gallagher Re. "Events are becoming more intense, and it's combining with more and more people moving into higher-risk areas."
Losses from natural disasters in the U.S. totaled about $165 billion in 2022, according to professional-services firm Aon, more than 140% higher than the median annual loss since 2000. Private and public insurers covered about $99 billion of that amount, Aon said.
Continued inflation, which makes it more costly to rebuild after a loss, is another factor. Reinsurers, which write insurance policies for insurance carriers to backstop them, also have raised their rates in the face of losses, said Liz Henderson, the head of the climate risk advisory team at Aon.
The problem is most visible in states such as California, Florida and Louisiana, where severe weather is relatively common. But weather such as thunderstorms and tornadoes, though often less damaging than hurricanes, for example, can still cause large losses and occur in a swath of the country.
Climate scientists tend to be reluctant to pin any given weather event on climate change, but some have linked a general warming trend to a pattern of more intense natural disasters. Henderson said areas that are prone to certain kinds of severe weatherare changing. Tornadoes, for example, seem to be shifting to the southeast of their traditional zone, she said.
Many observers have expressed hope that the tough market may yet turn a corner. In the U.S., June 1 and July 1 are major dates for insurance companies to renew their policies with reinsurers. Observers say that the market for reinsurance looks to have, if not cooled down, at least heated up less quickly. Though rates for property catastrophe reinsurance jumped between 25% and 35% in the most recent round of renewals, the level of increase is slowing, according to Aon.

Full text: PRINCETON, N.J. -- The federal government is spending billions, maybe trillions, of dollars to address climate change. A small group of researchers at Princeton University has played an outsize role in figuring out where that cash should go and what its impact could be.
The group's estimate last year that the spending would help cut emissions by about 43% by the end of the decade and that much of those gains were dependent on upgrading the power grid was widely cited by the White House and media organizations.
Led by Prof. Jesse Jenkins, the group was deeply involved in the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act. Its REPEAT, or Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit, project influenced the development of the legislation.
"Our ability to do rapid analysis of the legislation was a key part of the ecosystem that helped Senate staff target their most bang-for-the-buck provisions," Jenkins said. REPEAT is a collaboration between ZERO Lab and the consulting firm Evolved Energy Research.
When Jenkins's team determined that the Inflation Reduction Act would be a failure unless huge changes were made to the electric grid, John Podesta, the White House's clean energy adviser, called him out by name. "Jesse Jenkins at Princeton, I think maybe a little overstated, said we'll get 20% of the benefits of the IRA if we can't fix particularly this transmission problem," Podesta said in May at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C. A spokesman for the White House declined to comment.
Jenkins's ZERO Lab has become an important place for data and analysis of the energy transition. The climate law, which directs billions of dollars into clean-energy technologies, was tailor-made for the ZERO lab's skill set.
Jenkins, 39, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton's Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, studied computer programming at the University of Oregon and got his Ph.D. in engineering, with a focus on energy systems, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
A course at Oregon with physics professor Gregory Bothun "opened my eyes to all these challenges that would be fun to solve and societally important," Jenkins said in an interview.
Jenkins moved to Princeton in 2019 along with his wife and two children. Over the last four years, his lab has landed nearly $6 million in funds from nonprofit foundations, federal agencies, Bill Gates's Breakthrough Energy and corporate giants.
Jenkins worked closely with lawmakers during the crafting of clean-energy components for President Biden's Build Back Better act, which was scuttled when it couldn't get enough votes in the Senate. Then he worked on the climate bill, but that looked doomed to failure, too.
Last summer, Jenkins spent two weeks on vacation thinking that all his efforts of the past few years were dashed. In late July, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) announced an agreement on the Inflation Reduction Act.
The lasting impact of Jenkins's research may be the importance of upgrading the power grid. Jenkins raised an alarm in September when he warned that if the pace of certain improvements to the grid didn't double compared with last decade, emissions from the power sector could be worse by 2030 than if the Inflation Reduction Act hadn't passed. That shift will likely require federal legislation, he said.
The reason: Provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act will increase electricity demand through incentives for electric vehicles, heat pumps and other electronic devices. Without a huge increase in transmission capacity to move power from solar and wind farms to areas that need it, much of that new demand will likely be powered by fossil fuel plants, Jenkins found.
Sen. John Hickenlooper (D., Colo.) and Rep. Scott Peters (D., Calif.) earlier this year proposed a bill, called Big Wires, that would speed up transmission construction and require the nation's big power regions to be able to transfer at least 30% of their peak electrical loads to other regions.

Full text: Heat records are being set around the world, fueled by greenhouse gas emissions and El Nino, scientists say
Global temperature maps have turned dark red as rising temperatures culminated in the world's warmest day since record-keeping began in 1979, while last month was the hottest June, according to new data from U.S. and European scientists.
The global average atmospheric temperature on both Wednesday and Tuesday was 62.9 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the previous record of 62.6 degrees on Monday, according to data collected daily by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and compiled by the University of Maine.
In a separate assessment Thursday, the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a division of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, found that June 2023 was the hottest June registered, with an average temperature of 61.7 degrees.
Climate scientists at the Copernicus weather service, a scientific agency funded by the European Union, say the record temperatures are the result of industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that have accumulated in the atmosphere over decades and a powerful El Nino weather pattern -- a natural phenomenon -- that has developed in the Pacific Ocean.
"This is what we expect to happen with global warming progressing and having an El Nino on top of that," said Robert Rohde, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, an independent climate data organization, not involved in either report. "Now we're hitting the highest temperatures we've ever seen."
The heat has reached all corners of the planet, from record temperatures in Northern Europe to record-low sea ice cover in waters around Antarctica, say scientists from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, who based their findings on temperature data collected from satellites, weather stations and oceangoing instruments.
Last month, the global atmospheric temperature was 0.95 degree Fahrenheit above the 1991-2020 average, beating the previous record in June 2019. Europe experienced an even higher temperature anomaly, reaching 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit above average, according to the service. June 2023 was the hottest June on record, the report said.
The Copernicus report noted record temperatures were felt across northwest Europe, parts of Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Asia and eastern Australia. Cooler-than-normal temperatures presided in June over western Australia, the western U.S. and western Russia.
Texans felt the heat more than most, as hundreds of people got sick and more than a dozen died from heat-related causes. Floods, hail and tornadoes compounded the misery and caused power outages for hundreds of thousands of customers.
In the U.K., last month was officially the hottest June since 1884, and experts said conditions were made worse by a marine heat wave that surrounded the British Isles.
"Provisional findings from the Met Office suggest this marine heat wave in turn amplified land temperatures even further to the record levels seen during the month," said Segolene Berthou, scientific manager of the Met Office, which is the UK's lead weather agency.
June 2023 was also the hottest June for global ocean temperatures since record-keeping began in the 1970s, and followed a similar monthly record set in May 2023, according to the Copernicus report. The average ocean temperature as measured between latitude 60 degrees north and 60 degrees south reached 69.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
Ocean scientists are concerned that rising ocean heat is affecting marine life over the long term by changing migratory patterns of fish and marine mammals, increasing ocean acidity levels, and damaging coral reefs, mangroves and wetlands that protect coastal communities from storms and sea-level rise.
"This is an extremely rare event that we're living through right now, in terms of global temperatures in the ocean," said Benjamin Kirtman, director of the Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Miami. "There are a number of different factors that may be contributing to that, but we don't know for sure exactly what's going on."
Kirtman, Rohde and other scientists who study the interplay between the ocean and the atmosphere say factors beyond climate change and the Pacific El Nino are also influencing ocean temperatures, but they haven't been able to pinpoint the exact cause of the record heat.
Rohde says sea and atmospheric temperatures aren't expected to cool anytime soon."I think we are set up for a record-warm July," he said.

Full text: Jigar Shah is living an investor's dream, one with more strings attached than a symphony orchestra.
Shah has $400 billion of government funds to pour into businesses touting green-energy projects. But he has to do it under the eye of critical lawmakers, cautious bureaucrats and the White House, which has already clashed with him on the politics of his lending juggernaut. Losses are likely and will be frowned on by Congress.
The line for Shah's cash stretches to 150 companies seeking $127.7 billion in loans, ranging from new companies with unproven products to giants such as General Motors and PG&E, the California utility blamed for deadly wildfires. Funneling that much money to climate startups in a short time would be near impossible. Shah has begun writing bigger checks, including a record $9.2 billion commitment to a Ford joint venture making batteries in Tennessee and Kentucky.
The source of Shah's financial firepower is the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office, an overlooked piece of the Biden administration's strategy to address climate change. Largely quiescent for almost a decade, the office is designed to finance businesses that are important to the country's energy transition but unable to borrow from traditional lenders, often because their technology is seen as too risky or because the terms are too onerous.
"We would absolutely look at investing alongside them," said Jehangir Vevaina, a managing partner at Brookfield Asset Management who helps oversee the private firm's $15 billion energy transition fund. That fund, one of the largest of its kind, typically invests in a company's equity, which can become less risky when government loans give businesses a stamp of approval, as well as lower borrowing costs than commercial banks.
Climate-related provisions in last year's Inflation Reduction Act gave Shah's office a windfall, multiplying its lending capacity 10-fold. That pile of cash is at least 20 times as big as most private green-energy funds, giving Shah and the Loan Programs Office a major role in shaping the American energy landscape.
That is how Shah found himself in early 2021 calling hundreds of clean-energy executives to pitch the loans his office could provide. Primary targets were clean-energy startups that had raised at least $100 million in equity financing. He also wooed big businesses with the resources to pay back large loans.
Some were reluctant to apply, worried about the complicated approval process and the risks of taking a government loan. Shah, eager to get funds out the door, can be impatient. In September, he pressed a startup company that has a plan for recycling batteries to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government to construct a plant.
The company's chief executive, Ajay Kochhar, was hesitant, unsure how quickly it could repay. "Get your ass to Pittsburgh," where a clean-energy conference was about to start, Shah told the executive, according to people familiar with the conversation.
At a coffee shop soon after, Shah told Kochhar, of Li-Cycle Holdings, that its recycling plant could easily generate enough revenue for repayment. Five months later, the two announced a $375 million federal loan.
Shah's office is "the clean-energy bank of the United States," said Peter Davidson, who led it from 2013 to 2015. With its burst of funding, "the floodgates have really opened," he said.
The loan program is part of the reason the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits and spending represent one of the largest outlays of taxpayer-financed industrial stimulus since the 1930s New Deal.
In early June, Shah's office committed $850 million to startup battery maker Kore Power. The loan would fund what the company calls the KOREplex, a giant battery manufacturing facility in the desert about 35 miles west of Phoenix.
Shortly after, the Loan Programs Office announced the record commitment to the Ford battery venture. The $9.2 billion agreement is bigger than the $5.9 billion Ford borrowed from the office starting in 2009, when it was struggling through the financial crisis.
Hanging over the Loan Programs Office's every move is what Shah called "Solyndra PTSD." Despite the office's successes, which include backing Tesla, it remains dogged by a busted loan to solar-panel startup Solyndra.
Solyndra failed in 2011 after China flooded the market with low-price panels. In addition, an investigation by the Energy Department's inspector general found Solyndra had misrepresented facts and omitted key information in getting the loan. The $535 million loan that went sour made staffers cautious, borrowers nervous and critics of the program aggressive.
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has called the expanded funding "Solyndra on steroids" and said the Inflation Reduction Act's new spending and lending "has heightened the risk for waste, fraud and abuse." She said her committee is in regular contact with the loan office.
Shah's first loan deal after taking over in 2021 was a $1 billion commitment to Monolith, a company that aims to produce hydrogen from natural gas. The company's technology will capture the carbon that the process yields and turn it into a material for everyday products such as tires. Clean hydrogen is an alternative to oil and gas.
Several members of Shah's staff worried the deal was too risky, people familiar with the matter said. Shah argued it was safe because it required Monolith to set aside revenue and meet rigorous requirements before getting the money, such as showing its production process would work at scale. Monolith hasn't yet met them.
Last summer, Monolith raised more than $300 million in equity from investors including BlackRock and NextEra Energy, the most valuable power company in the U.S.
Staff members raised concerns about a potential loan to a company called Syrah Resources, a producer of graphite, which is used in rechargeable batteries, people familiar with the matter said. Raw material for its Louisiana processing facility would come from a mine in Mozambique, the scene of terrorist attacks, raising concerns that disruptions would threaten Syrah's project. Shah pushed ahead, on the grounds that the program was protected in the deal and the U.S. needed to lessen its dependence on China for graphite. The office issued a $102 million loan last summer.
When Shah supported granting a loan for an Occidental Petroleum project, White House officials told him it could backfire. The project involved removing carbon from the atmosphere via a new technology, then injecting it into the ground to extract more oil. Administration officials worried about a backlash from environmentalists, a person familiar with the discussion said.
Shah argued it was worth exploring as a way to develop carbon-removal technology. The loan application is still working its way through the office. Occidental's first big carbon removal plant is under construction.
Despite having lived for decades around Washington, D.C., Shah seems more like a creature of Silicon Valley's high-tech culture than a Beltway denizen. He co-founded a solar-energy company, SunEdison, in 2003 with a home-equity line of credit. It revolutionized the way businesses and homeowners paid for rooftop solar panels. Under its financing concept, which Shah drew up for a business-school class project at the University of Maryland, the panels are typically paid for over a 20-year stretch, in part with buyers' savings from generating their own power, making the panels almost free in the long run.
Installations exploded, and SunEdison became North America's largest rooftop-solarprovider. Shah left in 2008, the company was sold in 2009. Years later it went bankrupt after an aggressive growth strategy backfired.
Shah co-founded clean-energy investment firm Generate Capital about nine years ago. His effusive personality and list of contacts helped build Generate into one of the largest clean-energy investment firms. At Generate's San Francisco office he would hold court in a cavernous space known as the "Jigar-torium."
When approached by the Biden transition team about leading the Loan Programs Office, Shah was reluctant. On a podcast he used to co-host called, "The Energy Gang," he once called the office "irredeemable" because it was doing so little.
Patti Poppe, now the CEO of PG&E, listened to the podcast in the mornings while exercising on her treadmill. "It would make me run faster because he'd make me mad," she said. Shah often criticized utilities for moving too slowly. Poppe eventually invited Shah to talk to the management team at her previous job in Michigan and became convinced the industry needed to be more aggressive.
At PG&E, she is seeking a roughly $7 billion loan to upgrade and bury the utility's outdated power lines, to reduce wildfire risk and keep up with rising electricity demand driven by electric vehicles.
Before Shah took the job, his Generate colleagues told him accepting was a dumb idea unless he could make the office more efficient, he said in an interview at his Energy Department office, clad in his blue fleece vest and Stan Smith tennis shoes.
He outlined his demands, including provisions that would make it easier to lend to companies in the electric-vehicle supply chain. On a call with DOE officials, they agreed to all of his conditions, he said. "I was like, 'Damn you!' " he recalled.
He tripled the agency's staff to roughly 250 and recruited debt experts from banks.
"If anyone can crack through some of the red tape, it's a force of nature like Jigar," said Scott Jacobs, who co-founded Generate Capital with Shah and one other person. "Yet I'm not sure anyone can get through all of the bureaucracy."

Full text: PARIS -- The leaders of wealthy nations want private investors to send a flood of capital to poorer countries to lift them out of poverty and bankroll the response to climate change. Instead, those investor funds are drying up.
Rising interest rates and financial stress have choked off finance to the world's poorest countries, leaving them with debt burdens that are larger than they have been in nearly three decades. The market turmoil and the aftereffects of the global pandemic have pushed these countries deeper into poverty, reversing years of income gains and undermining their transition to cleaner energy, one of the rich world's top development priorities.
The gap between advanced economies and poor ones on wind and solar deployment is so large that the Netherlands, one of the rainiest countries in Europe, generates more solar electricity than all of sub-Saharan Africa, said the International Energy Agency.
World leaders -- from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Chinese Premier Li Qiang to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen -- are gathering in Paris on Thursday and Friday to find ways to entice global investors to developing countries.
French President Emmanuel Macron, the host, has billed the meeting as a summit to agree on "a new global financing pact." French officials say it should update the mission of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, created by the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944, to include fighting climate change and protecting biodiversity.
"We simply can't address modern issues with institutions which were created for a very different world nearly 80 years ago," said Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados.
Among the financing ideas under discussion: Creating a new global tax on shipping, helping investors hedge against currency risk and repurposing the IMF's special currency, known as a special drawing right, that is allocated to wealthy nations for the benefit of poor ones, according to people involved in the talks.
Ajay Banga, who started as the World Bank's president this month with the backing of President Biden, rolled out a series of measures for responding to climate disasters on Thursday. The World Bank will now allow countries to pause debt payments after hurricanes and other disasters and repurpose funds toward recovery.
Banga also launched an initiative Thursday for improving the World Bank's own financing structure to better work with private firms. The moves come in addition to roughly $5 billion more in annual lendingthe World Bank will offer by lowering its equity-to-loan ratio to 19% from 20%.
Largely absent from the talks is the possibility that the U.S. could directly offer more financing to the World Bank and IMF. Such moves often face stiff opposition in Congress, where Republicans skeptical of foreign aid control the House.

Full text: The Panama Canal is going through its driest spell in more than a century, and an extended lack of rainfall could saddle global supply chains with delays and higher fees to move cargo.
The government agency that manages the artificial waterway implemented travel restrictions in May to avoid ships running aground, and since then some large vessels have had to reduce container loads by roughly one-quarter.
Further restrictions could go into effect in late June, authorities say. Meteorologists have warned that the water levels in Gatun Lake -- located in the center of the canal -- could hit record lows in July with the occasional climate event El Nino bringing higher temperatures and less rain.
Canal officials hope the second half of the year brings some relief. Panama is one of the world's wettest countries, but in the first five months of the year accumulated rainfall in the area around the canal was 47% below the historical average, according to the Panama Canal Authority. The canal opened to traffic in 1914.
The Panama Canal, whose daily water use is triple that of New York City, relies on rainfall. More than 50 million gallons of water are lost to the sea every time a ship moves through the locks. That water is replenished from a reservoir, which is in turn filled up when it rains. If there isn't enough rain, as was the case during droughtsinthe late 1990s, a number of ships could avoid the passage, according to canal executives.
Officials have spent years planning for more extreme weather events to preserve the canal's role as a vital trade route and avoid supply-chain bottlenecks like the grounded vessel that clogged the Suez Canal in March 2021. The large containership Ever Given blocked the waterway for six days, causing a backlog of more than 400 vessels and costing billions in trade.
Meanwhile, shipowners and charterers are adjusting their operations to meet the lighter-load requirements and areweighing the costs of routing shipments elsewhere.
Disruptions in the canal's operations would hurt Southern Hemisphere exporters and importers in the north. Brazilian meat, Chilean wines and bananas from Ecuador are routinely shipped across the canal, along with copper from Chile and liquefied natural gas from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The isthmus connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and handles about one-third of Asia-to-Americas seaborne trade.
Any issues also could upend the Panama Canal Authority's effort to boost business. It spent $5.4 billion for a new set of locks that accommodate larger containerships, aiming to be more competitive with Egypt's Suez Canal. Routes through the Panama Canal shorten the one-way trip by sea from Asia to the U.S. East Coast by roughly five days.
The canal hauls in more money from larger ships crossing the newer locks, which are now responsible for about half of its business. About 10 ships a day move through the newer locks, and about 27 smaller vessels travel through the older locks.
"The rainfall volume has been consistently falling over the past 20 years," said Ricaurte Vasquez Morales, the Panama Canal Authority administrator. "We are dealing with a climate crisis when we are at peak capacity, and we have to find new sources of water to store in our lakes."
The Panama Canal is the country's biggest foreign-revenue generator, responsible for more than $3 billion from tolls last year.
In addition to cutting cargo loads, shipowners are adjusting to Panama Canal restrictions by moving containers to trains to ensure safe passage through locks. In some instances boxes are unloaded from ships on the Pacific Ocean side of the canal, moved by rail and returned to ships before they continue their voyage through the Atlantic Ocean.
The Panama Canal Railway has had a 20% increase in volume in recent weeks from carriers affected by the drought, said Thomas Kenna, president of the railway.
Carrying larger amounts of cargo can help improve the economics of operating along shipping routes. The ship operators will likely reroute to avoid the canal if they face prospects of carrying fewer boxes in the summer, industry executives and analysts said.
"If the canal is seen as having limitations, it's not good for anybody," Mr. Kenna said. "The cargo will always find the most efficient way."
Shipowners are also responding by charging customers an average $600 more a box on vessels crossing the canal. The daily freight rate from Asia to the U.S. East Coast was $2,400 a container in May, according to the Freightos Baltic Index, but it is expected to rise in June, in part, because of the Panama Canal drought surcharge.
For now, A.P. Moller-Maersk and other liners such as Germany's Hapag-Lloyd and China's Cosco Group have no plans to divert ships away from Panama, but executives said it could happen if drought conditions persist.
"The low water levels at the Panama Canal are a clear example of the effects of climate change, which causes a ripple effect through the supply chain," said a spokeswoman for Maersk, the world's second-biggest liner in terms of capacity.
Vasquez Morales said extreme rain or drought conditions are more frequent occurrences than in the canal's earlier years of operation. That issue presents a challenge for the Panama Canal Authority, which supplies water to about 2.5 million people, or about half of the country's population.
The canal has hired the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the original canal builder, and earmarked $2 billion over the next 10 years to divert as many as four rivers into the waterway in addition to the three that already feed it.
"We would have done the same over a 25-year period if the weather stayed normal, but now it has to be done in 10 years," Vasquez Morales said.

Full text: WHITESBURG, Ky. -- In nearly four decades living here, Kasey Wright had never seen the North Fork of the Kentucky River flood her neighborhood at the water's edge. Then last July, thunderstorms unleashed a deluge, sending a torrent of water 6 feet high through her home.
Nearly a year later, Wright, her husband, John, and their 12-year-old son are in limbo. The family is crammed into her parents' house a mile away, awaiting word on whether their application for a Federal Emergency Management Agency buyout of the property is approved. They are leaning toward moving to Tennessee, prodded by their town's longstanding economic challenges, which the flooding compounded.
"You wonder what's going to be left here," said John Wright, 41 years old. "I think a lot of people will leave."
The unprecedented storms in the mountains of eastern Kentucky last summer illustrated a growing and often overlooked threat that scientists say is exacerbated by climate change: severe flooding across swaths of the inland U.S.
By one measure, Letcher County, Ky., where the Wrights live, has the largest hidden flood risk in the U.S.
The storms last summer dumped as much as 16 inches of rain over a five-day period, according to the National Weather Service, causing flooding that resulted in at least 44 deaths and swept away homes, bridges and other infrastructure. Scientists said it was a 1,000-year storm, or one with a 0.1% chance of occurring in a given year.
Just as stronger hurricanes are changing the economic and demographic profile of some coastal communities, the mounting risks of extreme weather in parts of the country's interior are poised to reshape regions like Letcher County. They are confronting residents with an existential question: Can they afford to stay and protect themselves against the threat, or do they need to relocate to safer ground?
Because of the way FEMA analyzes flood hazards, the agency underestimates risks in some areas, especially in central Appalachia, said Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street Foundation, a nonprofit research group known for quantifying climate risks, including flooding.
In determining so-called special flood-hazard areas, FEMA focuses on variables such as coastal storm surge and large rivers, not accounting for factors including precipitation and small streams. Yet those factors -- which First Street includes in its model -- are the main causes of flooding in Appalachia, where the mountainous topography sends rainfall streaming down hillsides and into networks of small waterways, Porter said.
"There are only varying degrees of flood risk, and if you currently reside outside a [special flood-hazard area], you are still at risk for flooding," a FEMA spokesman said. He added that the agency is moving toward a graduated depiction of risk that can better capture potential flooding scenarios.
While some climatologists and floodplain managers consider First Street's approach a useful complement to FEMA's, they caution that it isn't a replacement for the agency's maps.
First Street's model, developed with researchers at other institutions such as Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found parts of Appalachia have the biggest hidden flood risk in the U.S. -- defined as the gap between First Street's risk assessment and FEMA's.
Letcher County, which has a population of about 21,000, has the nation's largest risk, along with Virginia's Buchanan County, according to First Street. Among the 20 counties in the U.S. with the most hidden flood risk, eight are in eastern Kentucky.
The region is poorly equipped to deal with the problem. Eastern Kentucky has experienced decades of population loss due to the decline of the coal industry and the dearth of business investment to fill the void. With a meager tax base and limited state and federal funding, officials lack money for infrastructure such as flood walls and elevated roads. Few homeowners can afford to safeguard a housing stock with many old and vulnerable structures.
The Wrights' neighborhood, known as Upper Bottom, has long been one of Whitesburg's most attractive areas, with tidy, well-appointed homes. The flooding engulfed every property along four streets.
On a recent visit, debris from the disaster remained piled high in front of some homes. Several damaged houses were torn down, leaving empty lots. Some were in varying states of reconstruction, while others sat empty and ruined.
Ashley Cornett and her boyfriend and two children fled the home they rented in the neighborhood as the water rose last July, destroying virtually all their belongings. Weeks later, they moved to Lexington, Ky., about 150 miles away, in part so her older son, whose school was damaged by the flooding, could enroll in classes for the fall.
Cornett, 39, had been saving money to buy a house in Whitesburg, which had limited housing options even before the storms. "The flood obviously killed any potential for that," she said. "There's still nowhere to live back there . . . We will likely just stay in central Kentucky."
Down the street from Cornett's old rental, Libby Honeycutt and her husband own two properties. Honeycutt's sister, who is partially incapacitated, lived in one of the houses and had to be rescued by kayak during the flooding as the water rose to her chest.
Her sister suffered two heart attacks amid the stress, and after receiving treatment at a hospital, moved to Mississippi to stay with one of her daughters, Honeycutt said, adding that her sibling has no plans to return.
Honeycutt and her husband tore down the home where her sister lived but are rebuilding their own, which took on more than 5 feet of water, she said. They gutted the downstairs and replaced flooring, drywall, cabinets and appliances. They are largely financing repairs themselves, since they had no flood insurance -- which they didn't buy because the area hadn't flooded for as long as they could remember. A FEMA disaster-assistance payment of $37,500, along with smaller sums of aid, covered only a fraction of the costs.
"This 1,000-year flood could happen again," said Honeycutt, 67. "We're having a lot of weather that we never had before."
Though weather patterns fluctuate, the trend line over decades is clear: greater annual precipitation and stronger storms that are unloading more rainfall, said Austin Pearson, a climatologist at theMidwestern Regional Climate Center, a program between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Purdue University.
A federally funded study showed a dramatic increase in the rain falling in major storm events from 1901 to 2016 in both the Midwest and the Southeast.
"There's still a lot that we don't know, but data that we are seeing now points to this being linked to climate change," Pearson said.
Kentucky, Indiana and Tennessee have experienced among the largest increases in precipitation, according to NOAA.
The increased flooding risk confronts not only poor areas of Appalachia but also parts of eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina and Virginia that have been drawing affluent retirees and others.
In eastern Kentucky, several days of heavy rain in 2021 generated the worst flooding some areas had experienced in more than 50 years, according to the National Weather Service. That was followed by last year's downpour, which caused the North Fork in Whitesburg to blow past the previous flooding record of nearly 15 feet in 1957 and reach 21 feet before the flood gauge failed. Another bout of flooding hit Letcher County in February.
Amid steep, hilly terrain, most homes in Letcher County sit in flatlands beside creeks now more prone to swell. Many buildings aren't sufficiently elevated to ensure their safety in the event of a flood.
More than 2,100 homes in Letcher County -- about 25% of the total occupied housing units -- were damaged in last year's flooding, according to a study by the Ohio River Valley Institute and Appalachian Citizens' Law Center. Only about 4% of the damaged homes in the county had flood insurance, said Eric Dixon, one of the report authors. Many residents find the cost -- roughly $1,200 a year on average in Kentucky, according to the report -- too steep, and long considered it unnecessary since most homes lie outside flood-hazard areas.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development pledged nearly $300 million in disasterrecoveryfunding for affected areas. The state of Kentucky has allocated more than $200 million for housing, infrastructure repairs and other needs.
Homeowners in Letcher County filed 146 applications for FEMA property buyouts, yet many are awaiting approvals from the agency. The property buyouts are part of a FEMA program that provides funding to relocate people out of flood zones and turn the property into greenspace.
Homes, a nonprofit housing developer, has drawn on foundation grants and other funding to kickstart rebuilding, said executive director Seth Long. It completed 10 homes and has another three under construction in Letcher County, and is employing flood-mitigation measures such as elevating structures. Yet those projects address only a small fraction of the area's needs.
Hattie Joan Reed and her husband, whose home at the edge of the North Fork took on 5 feet of water, initially thought of moving away, but didn't want to leave their adult children. They looked for other homes, but couldn't afford what few offerings they found.
So they decided to rebuild their place, putting about $90,000 into the effort, mainly through a combination of FEMA disaster assistance and credit-card debt. They couldn't afford the $30,000 to $40,000 cost of elevating their home, nor the $30,000 it would take to reinforce the river bank on their property, which is steadily deteriorating each time it rains.
"Seeing how the erosion is coming up so fast, we think we probably made a bad mistake," said Reed, 72.
Local officials in Whitesburg are struggling to pay for repairs. FEMA provides disaster assistance, but the town has to pay up front for projects, then seek reimbursement -- a challenge for a cash-strapped government.
Whitesburg has shelled out roughly $500,000 to remove debris, put in new culverts and replace damaged water and sewer pipes, among other work, said Chris Caudill, the city administrative assistant. It will cost another $400,000 to re-asphalt roads, requiring the city to take out a loan, he said.
Among the mitigation measures local officials say the pledged government funding could cover: a housing initiative, backed by Gov. Andy Beshear, that includes building a multi-unit subdivision on flat, higher ground in Letcher County.
Some flood-prone areas may have to be declared uninhabitable, said Jeffery Justice, executive director of Pine Mountain Partnership, an economic-development organization for Letcher County. "We have to make some tough decisions," he said.
The town of Fleming-Neon, also in Letcher County, is grappling with the ravages of the flooding. A wall of water surged through downtown and damaged businesses, some of which remain boarded up. The flooding decimated Fleming-Neon's sewer system, sending wastewater into many residents' yards. The city has made emergency repairs, but the system needs a complete overhaul to become fully functional.
James Hall, whose trailer home at the edge of a creek was totaled, is trying to rebuild with $22,000 he received from FEMA. A friend gave him a beat-up trailer that he put behind his old one, farther from the creek, and he is using his carpentry, electrical and plumbing skills to fix it up. He plans to elevate it about 3 feet -- roughly the height floodwaters reached in his previous place -- by jacking it up on concrete piers.
Hall, 53, hasn't considered leaving. "I love this place," he said. "Ain't nothing here, but it's home."

Full text: NEW YORK -- Shell's new CEO said the London energy giant will ratchet back low-profit clean-energy investments while pumping out more fossil fuels, a pivot from a period when European majors emerged as enthusiastic champions of renewable-energy sources.
Investors on both sides of the Atlantic in recent months have rejected a string of climate pushes. Instead they have preferred the gushers of cash generated by record profits that have been fueled in part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
That thirst for cash has coincided with continued strong demand for fossil fuels, emboldening Shell and London-based rival BP to defend oil production and dial back aspects of the clean-energy focus they embraced with fanfare just a few years ago.
"This is a fundamental culture change," Shell Chief Executive Wael Sawan said in a presentation Wednesday on Wall Street designed to woo investors, particularly those in the U.S.
Sawan said Shell will shift more resources to the fossil fuels that drove its record 2022 profits. At the same time, it will abandon some previously set targets for low-carbon energy production and be more ruthless in demanding strong returns from all businesses.
"We are making choices, questioning projects and assets," Sawan told investors. He later told reporters that Shell isn't copying the models of U.S. oil companies that have stuck more with their traditional businesses. Rather, Shell is focusing on strengths like liquefied natural gas and trading while also developing profitable low-carbon businesses, he said.
"We're not an oil-and-gas-only investment case, and we're not a renewables-only investment case," he said.
Shares of Shell closed higher by less than 1% in London Wednesday.
Despite its record profits last year, Shell's share price relative to its earnings has trailed its biggest U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Since taking over the company at the start of the year, Sawan has made clear that he wants to address that discrepancy.
As part of that effort, the company said Wednesday it would share billions of dollars more of its profits with investors through increased dividends and buybacks. It also is promising to cut companywide costs and spend less cash on its businesses.
On the strategic front, Sawan reinforced the company's commitment to production of oil and gas, pleasing investors who have complained it was sinking too much cash into renewables and other businesses that have yet to produce the same returns. On the flip side, that direction will frustrate critics who have called for Shell to more aggressively invest in lower-carbon energy in part to combat climate change.
Shell had previously said it expected to reduce its oil production by 1% to 2% annually through this decade. After reaching targeted multiyear cuts sooner than anticipated, the company said Wednesday it now plans to keep oil flowing at a steady rate through 2030.
Sawan has laid the groundwork for this position in recent months by arguing that the world's continued thirst for fossil fuels has changed the pace at which it can adopt cleaner energy without cratering economies.
That stance has drawn criticism from low-carbon-energy advocates who say now is the time to kick fossil-fuel habits.
"Record profits off the back of the energy crisis should be boosting up green investment," Jonathan Noronha-Gant of nongovernmental organization Global Witness said in a statement.
Shell said on Wednesday that it plans to spend $10 billion to $15 billion by 2025 on low-carbon solutions, including hydrogen, biofuels and electric-vehicle charging. It said it was reiterating its commitment to long-range climate targets, including net-zero emissions by 2050.
Shell warned that its success depends on governments and companies doing more to help the world meet emissions targets -- and buying more low-carbon alternatives so that they become more profitable.

Full text: BERLIN -- As war rages on NATO's eastern edge, Germany's new national-security strategy focuses not just on more military spending but also on climate change and feminism.
The 76-page document, the first such government strategy in Germany's post-World War II history, marks Berlin's response to mounting global threats, from armed conflicts and pandemics to broken supply chains and cyber espionage.
"It is not just about defense and the army," Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday. "It marks the start of a process that will see government, business and society cooperate to strengthen our security."
Work on the strategy predates Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but the attack, which caught Berlin largely unprepared, gave the initiative considerably more urgency. The war cast light on Germany's depleted military after years of underinvestment and highlighted its dangerous reliance on Russian energy supplies and global trade flows.
Before the attack, Russia accounted for more than half of German natural-gas imports and Germany's largest gas-storage facility was owned by Russian state-controlled giant Gazprom. As Russia began to throttle supplies, Berlin rushed to buy expensive liquefied natural gas from others, contributing to a spike in energy prices.
Thanks to the measures outlined in the strategy, future governments would make sure such situations never occurred again, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.
Billing itself as an "integrated security strategy," the paper encompasses concrete measures not just to diversify raw-material supplies, build national food, medicine and energy reserves and improve cyber defenses, but also to combat climate change, promote biodiversity and better target development aid.
"Our security is linked to the security and stability of other regions of the world," the document states. "The government will pay special attention to the interests of women and disadvantaged groups as part of its feminist foreign and development policies."
Security also meant reassuring citizens that their private communications weren't being spied on by China or that the water they used was monitored for safety, Baerbock said.
On defense, the strategy repeats Germany's commitment to raise spending to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's target of 2% of gross domestic product a year. Last year, Germany spent 1.5% on defense.
A 100 billion euros, equivalent to $108 billion, five-year special defense fund created just after Russia's attack should help the government reach the goal in the short term. But based on current spending trends, the Cologne-based German Economic Institute forecast in December that Berlin would fall back under the 2% target from 2026.
Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said the strategy encompassed lessons from the conflict in Ukraine, for instance, stressing the need to expand and strengthen Germany's air defenses.

Full text: A first-of-its-kind climate trial is set to kick off Monday in Montana, where a judge will determine whether the state's constitution obligates public officials to do more to address global warming.
The case, brought by more than a dozen Montana residents who were between 2 and 18 years old when it was filed in March 2020, is among a wave of similar suits brought by youth across the country who argue that future generations will bear the consequences of a warming planet.
The plaintiffs argue that Montana's constitution, which has since 1972 explicitly guaranteed the right to "a clean and healthful environment," requires effective action protecting water, wildlife, public lands and the atmosphere.
The state's reliance on fossil fuels and their production, the youth argue, is at odds with that guarantee. They are asking the court to declare it unconstitutional, which could require state officials to consider climate impacts in future policy decisions, such as fuel and mining permit approvals, or efficiency and emissions standards.
The case is the first to get a full airing after previous attempts at the state and federal level over the past decade were tossed, usually on procedural grounds. A bench trial in Helena is expected to last two weeks and would likely include significant scientific argument over the impact of fossil-fuel production and use on the environment.
"Depending on how this trial goes, maybe Montana will push the bounds of climate leadership. It could show what it means to take responsibility for future generations seriously as Montana's constitution requires it to do," said Cara Horowitz, director of the environmental-law program at the University of California, Los Angeles law school.
The state has opposed the suit on procedural grounds, arguing in court documents that the constitutional challenge is overly broad. Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen's office didn't return a request for comment.
"There are no relevant facts to find, and there are no existing Montana laws or policies for the District Court to interpret, apply, or attempt to fashion some form of relief," attorneys for the state wrote in an unsuccessful attempt earlier this month to pull the case up to the state's supreme court.
Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit records in 2022 and are projected to continue their upward trajectory, according to a March report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The plaintiffs -- children of farmers, outdoor enthusiasts and athletes, as well as young members of Native American communities -- detailed the effect of rapidly shifting climates on their daily lives. They cited everything from wildfire smoke keeping them indoors or away from sports training, to unpredictable weather damaging crops and killing livestock, as evidence that the Treasure State's constitutional protections weren't being met.
They are represented by Our Children's Trust, a nonprofit public interest law firm that has led many of the climate cases for more than a decade.
"The constitutional law that we're using is 50 years old, and some of the provisions in the Montana Constitution are as old as the founding of the state," said Julia Olson, the group's chief legal counsel.
Montana's Republican-majority legislature has supported fossil-fuel infrastructure in the resource-heavy region and passed a law this session that explicitly prohibits the analysis of greenhouse gases and climate effects in environmental-impact reviews by state agencies.
Judge Kathy Seeley has previously stated she wouldn't issue a ruling that narrowly laid out what next energy steps the state should take, if she rules for the plaintiffs. Instead, a win for the youth would comprise an order finding the state of Montana had violated its own constitution.
Similar cases are moving forward in other parts of the U.S. Proceedings in a long-dormant federal case filed in Oregon are heating up after a judge this month allowed the plaintiffs to file an amended lawsuit. That case is also expected to go to trial. In Hawaii, plaintiffs seeking similar relief under that state's constitution are preparing for a fall trial.
The Montana case will be a harbinger of what's to come, according to Rebecca Bratspies, director of the CUNY School of Law's Center for Urban and Environmental Reform.Even a loss for Montana's plaintiffs could set important precedent and hold lessons for future climate-litigation strategies and the breadth of climate-science evidence allowed by the court, she said.

Full text: Insurance companies are pulling back on homeowners' policies in vulnerable areas nationally out of fear of floods, storms and fires made worse by climate change and soaring costs of rebuilding.
American International Group is planning curbs on home-insurance sales to affluent customers in some 200 ZIP Codes across the U.S. at high risk of floods or wildfires, people familiar with the matter said. The states affected include New York, Delaware, Florida, Colorado, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, the people said. AIG has already restricted new business in California.
In a little-noticed pullback, Farmers Group earlier this year stopped offering new home-insurance policies in hurricane-prone Florida. A spokesman said that "with catastrophe costs at historically high levels and reconstruction costs continuing to climb," the pause was designed to help Farmers more effectively manage its risk exposure.
State Farm and Allstate, meanwhile, are pulling back from California's home-insurance market. The shift is making it hard for some home buyers to get insurance and is sparking fierce wrangling over what is most to blame: climate change, inflation or regulations.
Insurers in California said regulatory curbs on pricing mean they can't recoup an inflation-driven surge in rebuilding costs, as well as rising losses from wildfires.
Payouts on claims to California homeowners more than doubled in 2019 through 2022, while premiums increased by only around a third, according to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, an industry group.
Consumer advocates accuse the major insurance companies of using their market power to push back on policyholder protections. "They're trying to bully their way out of oversight," said Douglas Heller, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America. "They're exploiting the moment to get something they've always wanted."
State Farm and Allstate declined to comment on the suggestion that they are trying to pressure regulators.
The insurers' moves leave homeowners with fewer choices or, in some cases, no choice at all, according to insurance brokers.
In California, State Farm and Allstate were "the only game in town" for multimillion-dollar homes in wildfire-exposed areas such as Lake Tahoe or Carmel, according to Jim Tolliver, a San Francisco-based broker with Woodruff Sawyer.
The decision by insurers to stop writing new home-insurance policies means properties including a Beverly Hills mansion that Tolliver is trying to find coverage for might not be insurable, he said. Allstate and State Farm are two of the five biggest insurers in the state. California has an insurer of last resort, the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, but that is expensive and offers bare-bones coverage of at most $3 million.
"California is a broken insurance system," Tolliver said. "It's a ticking time bomb."
Ricardo Lara, the state's insurance commissioner, disagrees, saying insurers in the past have paused and restarted writing policies. Lara, an elected official, added that the pullback won't deter his staff from scrutinizing insurers' pricing strategies "to prevent unjustifiably high rates."
California hasn't been a consistently bad place for companies to sell home insurance in recent years. The average loss ratio, which measures claims in relation to premiums, on these policies was better in the state than in the U.S. as a whole in six of the 10 years through 2022, according to the ratings company AM Best.
But wildfires, increasing in severity and frequency owing to climate change, have taken a toll on insurers' earnings. Since the start of 2017, seven of the eight wildfires with the highest insured losses have occurred in California, according to the insurance brokerage Aon. Reinsurers, which companies use to take on some of the risks of the policies they sell, have reacted to escalating losses on catastrophes by pushing up their prices.

Full text: Wildfires like those ravaging Canada are becoming bigger and more frequent as forests around the world increasingly dry out amid the warming climate.
Some of the biggest fires are breaking out in the boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere such as most of the ones in Canada. That is because the Arctic region has warmed nearly four times as fast as the rest of the world, said Carly Phillips, a Boston-based research scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
In the boreal areas -- mostly conifer forests with long winters and short summers -- of Canada and Alaska, she said the annual area burned has nearly doubled in the past 60 years, along with an increase in the frequency of large fires. Russia's vast Siberian forests have been consumed by giant fires, too. Phillips said this year's outbreak, while unprecedented in size, is just following the trend.
"I don't know if it's a tipping point, but what this underscores is that the climate crisis is here and now," Phillips said.
Nathan Gillett, a research scientist for Environment and Climate Change Canada, has published several studies on the link between a warming climate and the risk of wildfire. He said he's concerned but not surprised about the fires currently burning across Canada.
"The acreage burnt is more than 10 times the average," Gillett said. "But it is consistent with long-term trends that we are already seeing and projecting."
Wildfires are also spreading in other parts of the world. Firestorms ravaged Australia in 2020. Massive blazes swept through Greece in 2021 and Portugal in 2022. California became so dried out following years of record drought that even some of its giant sequoia trees -- famed for their resiliency against millennia of fire -- succumbed to infernos last year. California's wildfire threat, like in many other parts of the American West, has been compounded by an overabundance of trees due to decades of fire suppression.
As in the case of the Canadian fires, wildfire smoke from blazes in California and other parts of the West shrouded cities from Seattle to San Diego -- infamously turning the skies over San Francisco a Martian orange at one point in 2020. This year, by contrast, much of the West is experiencing a slow start to its fire season after an unusually wet winter and cool spring.
"What these fires have made very clear is this is no longer a regional problem," said Matt Weiner, chief executive officer of Megafire Action, a nonprofit started last year to try to direct policy solutions.
Canada's wildfire season is off to a blistering pace this year, with nearly 10 million acres of land already burned by early June, according to the country's natural resources department. In a typical fire season, about 600,000 acres would have been burned by this point.
Half of forest fires are caused by humans, mostly accidental such as from campfires, while the other half are ignited by lightning strikes, said Piyush Jain, an adjunct professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, and a research scientist at the Canadian Forest Service. "Overlaying all of that is climate," he said.
He added that last month was the hottest May on record in western Canada, where about 5.5 million acres of forest have burned so far this season, causing some energy companies to temporarily curtail production.
Jain said what is unusual about this fire season in Canada is that both the western and eastern sides of the country are burning at the same time, when normally it would be one or the other.
That is because a high-pressure ridge has parked itself across much of Canada, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "It's very warm, it's very dry and there's been very profoundly favorable conditions for the spread of wildfires," Swain said in a YouTube post this week.
Jean-Philippe Begin, a meteorologist for Environment Canada, said climate change is supercharging wildfires, although he hesitated to predict they would become more frequent in the future. Begin noted that Quebec only had half the moisture it usually gets over the past 35 days, while heat and sunshine added to the fire conditions.
"A warming climate can only amplify things when there's a setup like we've seen," Begin said.
Climate change is making the forests in the eastern part of the U.S. more susceptible to wildfire, too, scientists say. Michigan, for example, is experiencing extremely dry conditions, which has put the state in an unusual state of fire danger for this time of year according to Kerry Heckman, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Natural Resources.
"We're used to it in the spring before it greens up," she said. "It's really rare for us to be in this situation this time of year."
The state has already had a major fire. The Wilderness Trail Fire burned for days and consumed more than 2,400 acres before being put out on Tuesday. Firefighters have put out more than two dozen fires over the past week, and the state is no longer issuing open burn permits.

Full text: With the rise of ChatGPT and other artificial-intelligence chatbots, AI is everywhere, from your doctors office to your brokerage account. It's also poised to shake up another hot sector of the economy: clean energy.
Among those tracking this closely is Amy Francetic, co-founder of Buoyant Ventures, an $81 million venture-capital fund founded in 2020 focused on digital applications, including AI, for climate technology.
Her journey to climate technology started off in an entirely different arena: children's software. At Hasbro in the 1990s, she helped produce software for Mr. Potato Head and Candy Land games. She later founded a children's software company that she sold to Lego.
Now, Francetic is focusing on digital technology used for clean energy. About half of the companies Buoyant invests in use some form of artificial intelligence, she says. From Raptor Maps, which uses AI and drones to more efficiently manage farms of solar panels, to ReelData, which uses AI to optimize the growth of fish (think cameras in giant tanks), Buoyant's portfolio features cutting-edge startups that could help shape the energy transition.
We recently caught up with Francetic to ask her about what she sees for AI's future in climate tech.
WSJ: Can you tell me how you went from designing software for Mr. Potato Head to investing in AI for climate change?
A: It wasn't an immediate next step. I've always been comfortable at the intersection of business and technology. Early in my career, I founded a high-tech company called Zowie and sold it to Lego. Then I did some work at Stanford on fuel cells. I had a health scare and thought to myself, I wanted to work on something that meant something to me, that had some purpose and would make the world a better place.
That led me to clean energy. I started a technology accelerator called the Clean Energy Trust and ran it for seven years. That informed my point of view of how to make money in this space. And that's what led me to software [for clean energy]. That's what I know. I'm not a battery scientist, I'm not a chemist. I'm a digital-technology expert.
WSJ: What are some qualities in companies Buoyant looks to invest in?
A: We're looking for companies that have some measurable climate benefit. We have to be convinced that they can deliver that. About half the companies in our portfolio use AI to some degree.
WSJ: When people think about taking on climate change, they typically think of big physical infrastructure and gear like solar farms, windmills, geothermal and electric vehicles. How does AI fit into the climate-solution puzzle?
A: A lot of what makes that infrastructure work well is software and digital solutions -- whether that's stitching together the infrastructure or making it more cost-effective. That's the opportunity for software and AI to create efficiencies on top of that infrastructure.
WSJ: Your career in clean energy has spanned several cycles, from the brief heyday of the late 2000s to the drought of the early 2010s. Can you talk a bit about that journey and how it's perhaps changed in the past few years?
A: It wasn't fashionable. Now it's fashionable. A number of things have happened since the late 2000s. Back then a lot of these companies that were being funded were the kind that took a lot of capital. There wasn't a lot of capital to fund those companies in the later stages. The businesses were dying before they could get to commercial success. We've also had global consensus around climate change. The effects of climate change are so widely felt. That has created more of a global market for a lot of these technologies as well as global funders. There's a record amount of capital invested in climate. This is the go-go time. It's a great time to be making money in this space.
WSJ: A wave of cash is coming from government programs such as the Inflation Reduction Act. How is that affecting the investment environment?
A: The funds being deployed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles are really exciting. It creates more opportunities for software to figure out where to site infrastructure, where to put the chargers, how to manage the payments across different types of cars. We're excited about fleet management more than passenger vehicles. There can be tremendous emission reductions if you start to transition those fleets to electric.
WSJ: Tell me about Raptor Maps, which says it helps solar farms operate more efficiently. How does it do that and how does AI fit in?
A: They began as drones that flew over solar farms. The way this used to work, solar farms had to be inspected, and it had to be done on foot. When you think about how large these solar farms have gotten, you can see how long that would take. Now you can fly a drone over the farm in a day and take video. The cameras and sensors on the drones can determine which panels may be underperforming. They've created software products that will help manage the maintenance of the panels.
WSJ: One of the companies in your portfolio, ReelData, has a unique approach to fish farming. How does that work?
A: We've overfished our oceans. The way that people farm fish, they farm salmon in pens off the coast in the ocean. That creates a lot of environmental problems, hurts biodiversity and creates pollution.
Land-based aquaculture is a new way to produce fish. They use these giant pens in warehouses. The biggest cost of producing fish in these pens is food. ReelData uses AI and cameras installed in the pens to figure out how to optimize the feeding of the fish. It reduces the food cost. A lot of farmers are overfeeding the fish. Their AI is making these systems more profitable. They're using facial recognition for fish! They can track the growth of that fish and say, it's time to harvest.
WSJ: So-called virtual power plants, in which household energy resources can be tapped to power the grid, are getting a lot of chatter. Can you talk about what they are? One of your companies, Shifted Energy, seems to fit.
A: If you have solar panels on your home, if you've got a battery backup system, if you've got a heat pump, you can use that as a resource for the grid. You might be able to smooth out your demand profile. You might be able to use that solar power when energy prices are high. If you have extra energy, you can put that energy back into the grid. You could use your EV as an energy source. You have a bidirectional relationship to the grid.
Shifted Energy is [managing supply and demand] for homeowners who have electric water heaters. They're heating when renewable energy is available and when the price is cheapest. Their technology is also applicable to electric vehicles. It started in Hawaii where electricity prices are high and renewables have a high penetration. This innovation was fine-tuned to serve lower income families. Now they're deploying in California, Colorado, the Southeast.

Full text: Agriculture faces some daunting challenges from a changing climate in coming years, scientists project. Heavy rainfall is expected to become more frequent, with resulting erosion of soil decreasing available nutrients. Growing conditions are forecast to change regionally -- with some places seeing a potentially longer growing season, but others seeing drier, colder ones. Disease-causing pests and insects are expected to expand their range.
Growers soon could turn to new technological solutions to help cope. Here are a few of the latest.
'Wearable' Plant Sensors
A network of sensors for plants might helpextend the life of farmers' crops. Small, flexible sensors placed on plants' leaves could monitor how a crop is coping with environmental stressors, from hot, dry spells to a lack of nutrients due to soil elements washed away in heavy rain, says Yong Zhu, a mechanical engineer at North Carolina State University.
Zhu is part of a team that built and demonstrated sensors that can gather information such as hydration and temperature in plants and their immediate environment, as well as chemical hormones released by the plant in response to infection or environmental stress.
Made of silver, gold, and carbon nanomaterials embedded in a flexible polymer, the sensors were able to detect infection in tomato plants within four days, the team reported in a study published in the journal Science Advances in April.
Such sensors could provide a personalized report plant-by-plant to a farmer, allowing for precise delivery of water or fertilizer only when a plant needs it, says Qingshan Wei, a chemical engineer at NCSU who worked with Zhu.
The current design is limited: The polymer hardens when exposed to the sun, and the setup is connected by wires to a computer and juiced by an external power supply.
Future versions could be made of cheap, hardy, biodegradable materials that are solar powered, and wirelessly transmit environmental data, the team says.
Self-Planting Seeds
Wildfires have become bigger and more frequent as the climate has warmed, sometimes leaving hard-to-reach mountainsides razed of vegetation. As a possible solution for bringing slopes back to life, scientists envision tree seeds dropped by drone.
Lining Yao, a mechanical engineer and materials designer at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a team of scientists have come up with a surprisingly low-tech device to help make sure that seeds dropped by drone germinate into saplings.
These seed carriers with curved tails and a tightly coiled stem are made of paper-thin sheets of wood and attached to a seedpod. When rainwater touches the tails, the material swells, propping up the seed carrier with its point facing into the soil. Seeds with tails had at least 80% success rate burying into soil in lab tests, Yao and her colleagues showed in a studypublished in February in the journal Nature.
The researchers tested seeds of different sizes, including those of the whitebark pine, a high-altitude conifer that grows in regions of Western U.S. where wildfires are expected to increase. The team has had conversations with groups interested in aerial seeding, and is looking for partners for mass-manufacture and pilot tests.
"The bottleneck is to really scale up the manufacturing side of things," Yao says.
Robot Fruit Harvesters
As growing seasons shift with climate change, fruit may be ready sooner than growers expect.
Enter the robots. Tevel, based in Israel, has created a swarm of fruit-picking robots that could lend a few spare hands when fruits ripen unpredictably soon and risk spoiling on the tree, according to Ittai Marom, U.S. general manager at Tevel.
A platform on wheels serves as the base for a group of eight robots, which each have a picking arm ending in a gripper.As the platform rolls through an orchard, the robots fly up to tree branches, identify ripe fruit, pick it from the tree, and deposit them on a platform. There are cameras on the robot and Tevel's software identifies ripe fruit after analyzing the color and size.
"Somebody who is today a team leader of a picking crew, in the near future might find themselves monitoring a robotic picker from the convenience of an air-conditioned pickup truck," Marom says.
As part of a handful of collaborations, the robots have harvested apples in Italy and Chile, and peaches, nectarines and plums in California. There's room for improvement on speed -- for now people are still faster at gathering fruit off the trees, Marom says.
High-Tech Hives
Farmers reap big rewards when their crops are pollinated by bees. But pollinator populations are declining, while climate change is shifting the bloom seasons that bees depend on to shore up food stores through the cold season, and causing harsher winters. When temperatures drop, bees retreat to the hive and rely on their stored food, but if they run out, or cluster in a corner of the hive too far from the store, they can starve to death. A team of roboticists in Europe hopes to change this.
The team has built a device that monitors bee colony temperatures during the winter within wooden boxed hives used in agriculture. Thermal sensors and heating elements are built into a beehive frame, and covered in a wooden layer with a hexagonal pattern coated in melted beeswax to encourage bees to build on it.
Researchers warmed the bees when they becamestatic and gathered in a cluster duringwinter, and directed them to a food source at a different location by heating that section of the hive,the team reported in a March study published in Science Robotics. It was a partial success, says study author Rob Mills, a roboticist studying animal behavior at EPFL in Switzerland: Though the queen didn't survive, worker bees survived two months longer than she did that season.
The hives aren't ready for prime-time. For one, they are expensive to build outside a lab facility, and need an external power source to keep them humming.
Vertical Growth
In soaking humidity or searing heat, growers in over 40 countries are farming produce in high-tech containers made by the Boston company Freight Farms. Leafy greens like lettuce and kale, and roots like turnips and radish grow in specially designed vertical rows, lighted with LEDs, and monitored closely for nutrition, water acidity, temperature, and more, according to David Harris, the company's director of crop research and development.
Over two-thirds of all freshwater used globally goes to farming. In many places, climate change is expected to keep water in short supply even as demand increases. In a twist, growing plants in water instead of soil -- what's known as hydroponic farming -- could ease the crunch because it uses less water overall.
Compared with field lettuce grown in Arizona, lettuce in the containers uses about 0.3% of water per head, the company estimates. And Harris says the farms use almost zero added water in humid regions like Puerto Rico. But the energy used to run the containers is a hurdle to wide adoption, Harris says. The units on average use about 170-270 kilowatt-hours of energy per day, more than 5 times the amount used by the average American consumer. It's currently cheaper to grow some plants like corn in fields, Harris says.
"In 20-30 years, if we started to see some industrial scale corn farming in hydroponic systems, that would not surprise me at all," Harris says as higher temperatures begin pushing farming in some places indoors.

Full text: ELIZABETH, N.J. -- Giant cranes overhead were stacking thousands of containers on a 1,200-foot cargo ship, but a pair of engineers were looking down, examining storm drains and asking where water flowed during rainstorms.
The engineers from Zurich Insurance are trying to prevent serious damage from storms at A.P. Moller-Maersk's terminal at the Port of New York and New Jersey. The shipper and its insurer are aiming to mitigate risks made worse by climate change.
Zurich and some other insurers with big fleets of engineers, including Chubb and FM Global, are advising companies on how to fortify their properties against expected higher sea levels, storm surges, fiercer wind storms, wildfires and more intense rainfall. This was the latest in a series of visits to Maersk's shipping operations worldwide by Zurich engineers.
The terminal, which sits behind an IKEA store and across the New Jersey Turnpike from Newark Liberty International Airport, was closed for a week in 2012 due to flooding from a storm surge caused by superstorm Sandy. Storms like Sandy are expected to be more frequent and more intense, Zurich's analysis for Maersk indicates.
Many insurers and businesses had a wake-up call on climate change in 2017 when California wildfires and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria made it one of the costliest years ever for the global property-insurance industry. According to the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index, U.S. commercial-property rates have risen consistently for the past 22 quarters. In recent ones, inflation has been a factor.
Zurich offers its engineers' advice on current risks to its commercial-insurance customers. It sells longer-term climate analysis through its two-year-old Zurich Resilience Solutions unit to both companies it insures and those it doesn't. Maersk, a Zurich insurance client, sought analysis out to 2060.
In an earlier part of the Maersk assignment, Zurich's engineers had focused on the impact of wind to those tall cranes, including reviewing the company's plans for shutting them down. Their attention turned to where torrential rains and storm surge might cause future problems.
During Sandy, berths and piers were damaged in the port, and saltwater intrusion knocked out electrical equipment and power transformers, leaving the terminal without power.
So Nicolette Botha, Zurich Resilience Solutions' senior risk engineer, was trying to understand where water from a surge, or rainfall, would flow. She asked workers where rainwater puddled and where crucial equipment was stored. She took pictures of storm drains, electrical switchgear, transformers and computer servers.
She also climbed onto the flat roof of the building where the servers are housed to check its condition and drainage. She took note of how securely heating and ventilation equipment was installed.
Even if a policyholder is fully covered for a loss, "it is much better to prevent the claim to start with," said Zurich Insurance Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco. Zurich Resilience Solutions "is one of the highest-growth businesses we have," he said. The unit currently has more than 800 engineers.
In general, increased resiliency can help companies get better pricing than otherwise, insurance executives and brokers said.
Copenhagen-based Maersk said it hired Zurich for the climate-change analysis after the shipping company concluded that physical damage and business-interruption costs due to extreme weather were among its biggest risks.
At the New Jersey location, Botha said that her team expects to recommend such things as elevating certain equipment, adding flood barriers to keep water from entering buildings and replacing the roof she climbed onto to protect against "wind uplift."
Climate activists have been targeting banks and insurers to cut off financing and insurance coverage for fossil-fuel companies as a way to reduce carbon emissions and slow the effects of climate change.
Many insurers say a wholesale quitting of sales to oil-and-gas producers would put the world's economy at risk, because renewable energy isn't ready to pick up the slack.
Sierra Signorelli, CEO Commercial Insurance at Zurich, said that the carrier over the past decade has reduced its market share as a provider of insurance to the fossil-fuel industry, and it restricts insurance for certain fossil-fuel businesses while expanding offerings for the renewable-energy sector.

Full text: The biggest U.S. bank is making one of the biggest bets ever to remove carbon from the atmosphere as a way to fight climate change.
JPMorgan Chase has agreed to invest more than $200 million to purchase credits from several companies in the nascent industry, company officials said. The money and JPMorgan's endorsement are a boost to businesses that have removed only small amounts of carbon so far.
JPMorgan is making the purchases to neutralize the bank's environmental footprint. It is also attempting to score new business by becoming a leader in a burgeoning clean-energy industry. The bank helped carbon removal startup Climeworks raise $650 million from investors last year and has fielded questions from big corporate clients about carbon removal.
"We're jumping in the pool all in," Brian DiMarino, JPMorgan's head of operational sustainability, said in an interview. "This is us putting our weight and our capital behind something we believe is truly important to bring to market now."
Carbon removal is gaining increasing attention as it becomes clear that the transition away from fossil fuels is moving too slowly to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions enough to limit climate change. Scientists estimate billions of tons of removal will be needed annually by midcentury to avoid the worst effects of global warming. Critics say carbon removal could allow fossil-fuel producers to continue with business as usual.
As the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan is also among the largest financiers of both fossil fuels and clean energy. Its relationship with oil-and-gas companies has prompted criticism from climate activists. The bank also has been criticized by Republicans for giving priority to environmental, social and corporate governance -- or ESG -- factors. West Virginia banned JPMorgan from doing business with the state last year, arguing that ESG amounted to a boycott on the state's coal industry. JPMorgan said the move was "disconnected from the facts" and "anti-free market."
The bank will purchase credits tied to the removal of 800,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from several startups including paying more than $20 million to Climeworks, a Swiss company that recently delivered the industry's first verified carbon removals through a process called direct-air capture, which sucks carbon out of the air using giant fans so it can be buried underground. Climeworks will remove 25,000 metric tons over nine years.
Getting support from a financial powerhouse is validating after much of the sector's initial support came from technology companies, carbon-removal executives said.
"It's a big shot in the arm for us to go scale up our operations," said Peter Reinhardt, chief executive of startup Charm Industrial, which turns plant waste into a carbon-rich liquid that can be injected underground. Reinhardt said JPMorgan's purchases should help Charm raise money and reduce costs. The company has removed about 6,000 tons to date.
JPMorgan is buying nearly 30,000 tons of removal from Charm over five years.
The bank is also committing to match its operational emissions from directly consuming natural gas and other fuels with equivalent carbon removals by 2030, one of the first such pledges by a major company.
JPMorgan is aiming to reduce those emissions 40% by 2030 from 2017 levels. Big companies use a combination of emissions reduction and carbon removal to meet their climate goals.
Carbon-removal companies are attracting billions of dollars in government funding. The U.S. is expected to announce the recipients of $3.5 billion in funding for direct-air capture hubs around the country this summer. Climeworks has three applications in for that funding as part of a recent U.S. expansion, chief marketing officer Julie Gosalvez said.
Last year's Inflation Reduction Act includes tax credits for direct-air capture that Goldman Sachs analysts estimate could cover nearly half the cost of certain projects.
JPMorgan's commitment to fund about 800,000 tons of removal is the second-largest purchase in the market's history, according to data provider CDR.fyi. It would neutralize the annual emissions of roughly 160,000 passenger cars.
In the sector's largest-ever deal, Microsoft said last week it would pay for about 2.8 million tons of removal through a wood-chip-fired power station in Denmark operated by energy firm Orsted. When trees and plants grow, they naturally absorb carbon. Capturing that carbon, then permanently storing it, is one form of carbon removal.
By agreeing to pay years in advance, companies like JPMorgan and Microsoft hope to accelerate the industry's growth. They are willing to pay hundreds of dollars per ton for each removal credit to get the certainty that they are helping fight climate change. They also want to secure the credits they need to hit emissions targets.
Removal credits can cost 100 times more than conventional carbon credits, some of which don't benefit the planet. JPMorgan will still use some traditional credits, DiMarino said.
The bulk of JPMorgan's commitment -- about 450,000 tons -- is a preliminary 15-year agreement to purchase from CO280, a startup. The company's removal plans are roughly similar to those of Orsted in that it aims to capture carbon absorbed by plants when biomass is used in industrial processes. If CO280 fails, the bank will pay for removal from other companies, DiMarino said.
