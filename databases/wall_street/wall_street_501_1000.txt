Full text: There is a financial tug of war in the clean-energy sector, with a fear of rising rates and slowing economy competing with lucrative government funding designed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
The winner could determine whether the country meets the Biden administration's ambitious climate goals.
Cash poured into companies focused on renewable energy, batteries, electric vehicles and hydrogen producers when interest rates were low. Many were unproven and unprofitable, making them less attractive when rates went up. This year, the funding gusher slowed.
The failures of Silicon Valley Bank, a financier for a large number of clean-energy startups, and First Republic Bank, have sparked concerns that a source of financing for the sector is drying up.
"Every venture industry has been affected, and climate is no exception," said Amy Francetic, co-founder of Buoyant Ventures, a Chicago investment firm focused on clean energy that banked with First Republic.
At the same time, a wave of impending government funds, including tax credits, subsidies and low-interest loans for clean-energy companies is providing hope that the sector can successfully power through the doldrums.
The iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund is down about 5% this year, compared with a 9% gain by the S&P 500. Startup electric-vehicle makers such as Lucid Group, Fisker and Rivian Automotive have seen some of the sector's sharpest declines, their shares tumbling this year as the companies scramble for market share in an increasingly competitive market.
Peter Davidson, chief executive of climate investment firm Aligned Climate Capital, said his firm struggled to get other investors to put cash into BoxPower, a California solar microgrid startup. A $5 million investment by Aligned accounted for more than half of a recent financing round for the company. "There's never as much capital as you think," he said.
Davidson, who ran an Energy Department program that provides loans to clean-energy companies during former President Barack Obama's second term, said he remains optimistic about the sector. One reason, he said, is that consumers are increasingly making decisions based on climate change.
Another reason for optimism is the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, as well as state and federal regulations pushing industries and utilities to decarbonize. The Biden administration's recent proposal of new rules to reduce greenhouse gases from coal- and gas-fired power plants could help boost investments in renewable power sources such as wind and solar.
"Capital is very much still flowing into quality companies," said Shayle Kann, a partner at Energy Impact Partners, a $3 billion venture-capital firm that invests in clean-energy companies.
The Inflation Reduction Act is expected to provide some $1 trillion worth of incentives for clean technologies, driving trillions more in investments. Another slug of cash was channeled to clean energy from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure package, with funds dedicated to building charging networks, nuclear and clean hydrogen, among other things.
A growing boom in EVs and the lithium-ion batteries that power them is unlikely to slow soon. Global EV sales are expected to grow 35% in 2023 from the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency.
Some 47 major EV projects in the U.S. adding up to an estimated $49 billion in capital investment have been announced since the measure was passed in August 2022, according to Jay Turner, an environmental policy professor at Wellesley College who tracks the battery supply chain. EV charging companies are trying to keep up. Public charging ports are expected to increase 60% this year from 2022, according to J.P. Morgan research.

Full text: Bozeman, Mont. -- Sariel S. was 17 when she and 15 other youth plaintiffs sued the state of Montana for violating their "inalienable right" -- as set out in the state's constitution -- to "a clean and healthful environment." She lives on the Flathead Indian Reservation, and the suit alleges that climate change "is threatening Sariel's culture, which is already in jeopardy." The harm being done by climate change to "her community" is having "a profound emotional and psychological impact" on her.
Mika K., 11 at the time the suit was filed in March 2020, witnessed a forest fire the year before that came within a mile of his house in Missoula. Mika is "anxious," the suit alleges, that "as the climate crisis worsens he will lose his family home to climate disruption."
The 16 plaintiffs (the youngest of whom is now 5) attribute the perceived dangers to their culture, homes, health and natural environment to the "dangerous impacts of fossil fuels." These, they allege, result from the reckless energy and economic policies of successive state governments. In effect, they're saying that the promotion of fossil fuels (and perhaps even their use) is unconstitutional in Montana.
The lawsuit in question is Held v. Montana -- the case name derives from Rikki Held, 21, the oldest plaintiff and the only one not represented at the start by a guardian. It goes to trial on June 12 in Helena after unsuccessful attempts by the state to have the case thrown out on grounds that the plaintiffs lack standing.
The case replays Juliana v. U.S. (2020), in which a group of juvenile plaintiffs argued in federal court that they had an unenumerated right under the U.S. Constitution to a "stable climate system," a right that could be vindicated only by a court-mandated reduction in national fossil-fuel emissions. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the suit, to no one's surprise: The remedy the plaintiffs sought was flagrant progressive overreach.
But Held in Montana is different, resting as it does on clear words in a state constitution, not on fanciful appeals to unenumerated obligations. If successful, the suit could be contagious. There are other states with constitutional provisions that resemble Montana's. Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts and Hawaii all hold out to their citizens some form of comparable right. In Massachusetts, "the people shall have the right to clean air and water." In Illinois's case, it's a right to "a healthful environment." Likewise in Hawaii, where the constitution refers also to "the protection and enhancement of natural resources." A suit much like Held is before the Hawaiian courts, proof that the Montana lawsuit offers -- in the eyes of its activist backers -- a road map for future climate litigation in states across the U.S.
That is the avowed mission of Our Children's Trust, a "non-profit public interest law firm" -- to quote from its website -- "that provides strategic, campaign-based legal services to youth from diverse backgrounds to secure their legal rights to a safe climate." The firm is funding the Montana suit and boasts it is "the first ever constitutional climate trial and first ever children's climate trial in U.S. history."
This is its second legal salvo in Montana. It tried -- and failed -- to force the state to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in 2011. The state Supreme Court dismissed its petition that year. But if the plaintiffs succeed in Held, "we should expect to see a flurry of such Greta Thunberg lawsuits," says Terry Anderson, citing the Swedish ideologue who has made climate militancy such a feature of underage politics in the West.
An emeritus professor of environmental economics at Montana State University, Mr. Anderson is an expert witness for the state. He believes the allegations of public harm from fossil fuels are baseless. "Montana contributed 0.07% to global greenhouse-gas emissions in 2020," he says. "The state's policies have virtually no effect on global climate change, and no effect on the welfare of Montana's citizens, other than the contribution that fossil-fuel production makes to the state's economy, and that effect is a benefit to Montana's citizens." He also points out that "over the period of time they're claiming this harm occurred, people are living longer and their air and water is better."
The office of Austin Knudsen, Montana's attorney general, says in an email that "this entire lawsuit is a meritless publicity stunt [by Our Children's Trust] to increase fundraising for their activism at the expense of Montana taxpayers." Our Children's Trust is "a special interest group that is exploiting well-intentioned Montana kids to achieve its goal of shutting down responsible energy development in our state."
Philip Gregory, an attorney for the plaintiffs, is adamant that the suit is necessary to "constrain the state from engaging in further conduct repugnant" to constitutional limits. He tells me that "the state of Montana is scared of going to trial" against the 16 youth plaintiffs. "Since the suit was filed three years ago, the state has tried six times to have the constitutional case dismissed and to avoid trial."
The attorney general's office scoffs at this sort of assertion. "Unable to implement their policies through the normal processes of representative government," it tells me, "these out-of-state activists are trying to use liberal courts to impose their authoritarian climate agenda on Montanans."

Full text: When plans for the SunZia project -- a massive power line and wind farm in the Western U.S. -- were first laid in 2006, Taylor Swift had just released a debut album and George W. Bush was president.
The project finally received a crucial permit this week.
That 17-year process underscores why some in Washington say there is a pressing need for an overhaul of the country's rules for approving infrastructure projects.
The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management gave the green light on Thursday for a high-voltage power line. The permit allows the developer Pattern Energy to build the country's largest wind energy project across three counties in rural New Mexico and deliver that electricity to large markets in Arizona and California.
Developers first applied for federal approval in 2008; environmental reviews started in 2009. In 2011, the project was "fast-tracked" by the Obama administration.
David Getts, general manager of Phoenix-based Southwestern Power Group, the original developer of SunZia, said that when the project was conceived in 2006, the company thought it would receive its permits in about five years.
"We didn't honestly know enough to know what we were getting into," Getts said. "And of course, here we are 17 years later."
President Biden and U.S. lawmakers are now making another run at streamlining the federal permitting process, with the issue becoming a central topic in ongoing negotiations to raise the debt ceiling.
Most agree the system is flawed. The labyrinthine state, local and federal permitting processes are often drawn out for years, require duplicative paperwork and generate thousands of pages of government analysis. The average federal environmental review, for example, takes 4 1/2 years, according to a 2020 White House report.
But vast divides on energy policy between Republicans and Democrats have stalled efforts thus far to change the system.
A deal negotiated last year by West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin as a companion to the Democrats' energy and climate-spending law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, would have helped speed energy projects from wind- and solar-power development to pipelines for oil and gas, in part by streamlining federal permits and limiting court challenges. It failed to secure enough support to pass Congress, as some Democrats balked at weakening environmental protections, while some Republicans rejected easing the way for renewable projects.
Another effort could revive portions of the legislation, either as a stand-alone bill or as part of the debt-ceiling talks. Meanwhile, the White House last week issued recommendations for executive and legislative changes aimed at speeding up the approval of transmission projects such as SunZia.
John Podesta, a top Biden climate adviser who has worked in several Democratic administrations, said he was surprised to discover when he returned to the White House last year that a transmission project that came across his desk during the Obama administration still hadn't been approved. "That's unacceptable," he said at a recent event.
Podesta is spearheading the administration's efforts to overhaul permitting rules. New guidance issued by the White House directs agencies to complete permitting decisions and environmental reviews for transmissions projects within two years and allows companies to petition the president directly if the government misses permitting deadlines.
Democrats and Republicans have differing visions for changes in permitting. For many Democrats, it is largely about speeding up the country's transition to renewable energy to better position the U.S. to tackle climate change. Many Republicans want to ease the approval of oil and gas projects.
Environmental groups worry that efforts to accelerate permitting could weaken protections for vulnerable communities.
Opponents of the SunZia project say the yearslong saga can't solely be blamed on bureaucratic paralysis, adding that the project altered part of its route.Southwestern Power sold SunZia last year to Pattern Energy, which said it takes time to work with federal, state and local governments, as well as stakeholder and environmental groups, to determine the best route.
"SunZia is not the hapless victim of excessive red tape," said Peter Else, the head of a local conservation group who has challenged the project in court. "They are the victim of their own poor land-use planning."
The 3,500-megawatt wind farm and transmission line, along with a parallel line being developed by Southwestern that also received approval on Thursday, are intended to complement the abundance of solar-energy projects across the region. Pattern Energy expects to start construction this year.
Some White House officials worry that red tape could delay projects funded by the infrastructure and climate legislation that Biden recently signed into law.
"The White House doesn't have a prayer of implementing the infrastructure bill or the [Inflation Reduction Act] without permitting reform," said Rep. Garret Graves (R., La.), a lead Republican negotiator in the debt-ceiling talks. "And anyone who's actually out there trying to build things will tell you that."

Report Warns of
Record Temperatures
Global temperatures are likely to surge to record levels during the next five years and breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement, scientists said in a new report.
Warning that the world could be entering a new phase of climate change, researchers at the World Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency, said there was a 66% likelihood that annual average global temperatures would exceed the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2027.
"This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years," WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said Wednesday. "However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5 degree Celsius level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency."
Warming at those levels could have profound implications for health, food security and water management, he said.
The Paris agreement in 2015, signed by more than 190 countries, set a goal of containing the rise in global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to no more than 1.5 degrees.

NIGERIA
Attack on American
Convoy Leaves 4 Dead
The State Department on Wednesday said it was scrambling to account for dead and missing embassy personnel in Nigeria a day after an attack on a U.S. convoy killed at least four people.
The State Department said that the motive for the attack was unclear and that it didn't have any indication that the U.S. mission was deliberately targeted. Nine people were traveling in the two-vehicle convoy, which was visiting a U.S.-funded aid project in the Anambra region.
"The assailants killed at least four members of the convoy, and U.S. Mission personnel are working urgently with Nigerian counterparts to ascertain the location and condition of the members of the convoy who are unaccounted for," the State Department said.
The attack comes amid heightened security concerns in Nigeria. Africa's largest economy and most populous nation has suffered years of debilitating economic and security crises and escalating insecurity caused by militant groups.
The surge in violence has included Islamist terrorist attacks, mass kidnappings and clashes between farmers and herders. Last year, rampant theft and costly fuel subsidies meant that Africa's largest producer of crude barely benefited from high global oil prices.

ITALY
Heavy Rains Kill 8,
Cancel Grand Prix
Exceptional rains Wednesday in a drought-struck region of northern Italy swelled rivers over their banks, killing at least eight people, forcing the evacuation of thousands and prompting officials to warn that Italy needs a national plan to combat climate change-induced flooding.
The heavy rains also forced Formula One to cancel this weekend's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix to not overtax emergency crews that were already stretched thin in responding to the rivers of mud that have torn through the region, wreaking havoc on infrastructure and homes.
Days of rainstorms stretched across a swath of northern Italy and the Balkans, where severe floods, landslides and evacuations were also reported in Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia.
The deputy governor of Emilia-Romagna, Irene Priolo, said eight people were killed and others unaccounted for in flooding that forced the evacuation of more than 10,000 people.
On Wednesday evening, authorities in the province of Ravenna, a tourist town famed for its Byzantine-era mosaics, about 14,000 people were ordered to leave their homes as a precaution because of fears that three rivers could overflow their banks.

Full text: Larry Fink co-founded BlackRock in 1988 and has spent 35 years nursing it into the world's largest asset manager. Now, half a lifetime later, he has one big task left: deciding who will take it over.
"That's the No. 1 priority," Mr. Fink said in a recent interview. At 70 years old, he is the only person to ever hold the title of BlackRock CEO.
He and Rob Kapito, 66, BlackRock's president and a fellow co-founder, have been training five key leaders for years, a contest that some inside the company call "The Great Race."
Among the contenders are Mark Wiedman, who runs the global commercial business; Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein; and Chief Financial Officer Martin Small. Rachel Lord, who is head of the Asia Pacific business, and Salim Ramji, the head of ETFs and indexing products, round out the list.
Whoever replaces Mr. Fink will lead a company that most Americans know little about. Yet it is widely perceived on Wall Street and in Washington as perhaps the most influential financial firm in the country, thanks to the stakes it owns in thousands of firms around the globe and its role in managing retirement accounts for over 35 million individuals.
The next CEO must manage the growth that has made the firm so large and successful, without running afoul of the increasingly complex and volatile politics of the U.S.
Mr. Fink maintains that succession planning is less about who will replace him and more about who will become the next group of leaders. After all, Mr. Fink and Mr. Kapito started BlackRock with six other co-founders. He said he would prefer to build camaraderie among the five, and not competition, in hopes they will continue to work together after just one is crowned.
When exactly that might be isn't clear. Mr. Fink states he has no imminent plans to retire. The only absolute he will share around timing is that he would prefer to not be at BlackRock in his late 70s. That means there is ample time for his plans to change.
The job of BlackRock CEO has grown more public-facing over the past several years, with the firm taking bolder stands in voting for shareholder proposals that involve social and climate issues. Since 2018, the firm has signaled that its portfolio companies should focus on having two women on every board, answer questions around gun safety and consider climate risk an investment risk.
Conservatives in Washington argue these are liberal causes, and people who let BlackRock manage their retirement plans never consented to supporting them. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle question BlackRock's size. The firm owns stakes in 13,000 companies and manages $8.6 trillion in assets.
BlackRock said it is driven by making sound financial decisions for its clients, and the asset-management industry is fragmented enough that its size isn't an issue.
"Where I got it wrong," Mr. Fink said, "was how quickly. . .we would become the next 'it' firm to be revered and hated."
Mr. Fink's potential successors said they would try to be more transparent about what the firm does, hoping that openness will cool some of the recent backlash.
Mr. Fink was supposed to be gone by now. When BlackRock signed a commercial lease agreement seven years ago in an unbuilt skyscraper at Hudson Yards, Mr. Fink told confidants that chances were slim he would be at the firm when the new headquarters opened. Today, Mr. Fink occupies a corner office facing 10th Avenue.
Mr. Fink said the pandemic slowed his process for choosing a successor. Some people close to Mr. Fink said he isn't ready to leave yet.
He has been traveling with his heirs apparent and sending them on trips without him. The goal, he said, is to see how they work together and how they represent the firm to clients.
In February, Mr. Fink traveled with Ms. Lord and Mr. Wiedman through Asia, visiting Hong Kong, Singapore and India in four days.
The next month, Mr. Fink sent a team of executives to Zurich as Credit Suisse Group was teetering. The group included Mr. Kapito and most of the potential successors. Their job was to assess whether they were needed for a rescue plan. They weren't.Mr. Fink called the excursion a "slam dunk" after hearing how his executives worked together in a fast-moving situation.
Recently, Mr. Fink has let Mr. Wiedman, 52, take the lead in speaking to clients about BlackRock's energy investments. Mr. Wiedman, unlike his boss, prefers to avoid the word "climate" when he can. Instead, he talks about the "transition to a low carbon economy."
"This isn't about whether you believe climate change is happening," Mr. Wiedman said. "We're in the business of taking your investment objectives and putting them to work."
Mr. Wiedman has spent much of the past eight months on the road. He visited Volvo's electric-truck testing facility in Sweden and toured a sustainable construction facility in Switzerland, among other stops, publishing videos on LinkedIn.
Mr. Goldstein, 49, helped take the lead on visits to Washington, D.C. Executives have been meeting with lawmakers, including Republican antagonists who criticized BlackRock's efforts in environmental, social and corporate-governance investing.
Mr. Fink told confidants that while he has strong relationships with financial regulators, he never had to pay much attention to legislators in Congress. Last year, BlackRock executives made more visits to Washington than ever before to meet with senators and representatives, The Wall Street Journal reported.
"You can make your own choice on whether you like us or don't like us," Mr. Goldstein said. "But at least know us and know the facts before you make that choice."
Like other asset managers, BlackRock typically votes on behalf of the investors who own the shares of portfolio companies. Critics say that allows the firm to wield an unusual amount of influence over American corporations.
BlackRock has made proxy voting available for some institutional investors. But only about a quarter of those investors elected to vote their shares.
Mr. Ramji, 52, said he would like to use technology to make voting choices simpler, which could get more investors to engage. "If Starbucks had put up a menu with 170,000 different choices, it would be an intimidating setup," he said.
He lists Germany, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore as markets where BlackRock will aim to expand its ETF offerings.
Ms. Lord, 57, has been tasked with navigating the regulatory hurdles and other challenges of doing business in China. In 2021, BlackRock became the first foreign asset manager to obtain a license from Chinese authorities to start a wholly owned onshore mutual-fund business.
But after years of Covid-containment measures, foreign businesses are now grappling with geopolitical concerns as U.S.-China ties sour.
BlackRock has 200 employees, mostly Chinese nationals, working in the Shanghai office. Ms. Lord splits her time between Hong Kong and London.
"Are foreign firms actually going to be able to build a business in China? It feels like they can, but that might change," said Ms. Lord. Still, she said it is an investment worth making.
Mr. Small, 47, became chief financial officer this year after leading the firm's U.S. wealth advisory business. He led the 2021 acquisition of Aperio, a Sausalito, Calif.-based startup that builds customized index funds for mostly high-net-worth clients.
In his new role, Mr. Small helps lead corporate strategy, which includes conducting annual reviews of each business unit and bringing those findings to the board for a yearly strategy refresh.
"There is this constructive anxiety here, a persistent phobia on whether we can be displaced," he said. "We don't want to become the firm that we set out to disrupt."
As for Mr. Fink, he doesn't think BlackRock will be his last job. He could become an adviser to early-stage companies, he said. There is also a chance he will stay on as chairman after he steps down as CEO, a scenario he had once ruled out.
"All I know," Mr. Fink said, "is that I'm not going to be sitting on a beach."

Full text: She might be one of the leads of 2018's surprise hit romantic comedy "Book Club," but Jane Fonda has never actually been in a book club. "I've had my books read at book clubs," said the actor and activist, whose most recent memoir, 2020's "What Can I Do?" is a call-to-action about climate change.
Opening this weekend, "Book Club: The Next Chapter" follows Ms. Fonda and her friends (played by Candice Bergen, Mary Steenburgen and Diane Keaton) on a raucous trip to Italy and, like its predecessor, showcases the Oscar winner's less serious side. Humor is a facet Ms. Fonda has explored in earnest over seven seasons of the Netflix series "Grace and Frankie" and in this year's comedy "80 for Brady," another box-office success that saw Ms. Fonda, Sally Field, Rita Moreno and Lily Tomlin head to the 2017 Super Bowl.
More than four decades after the release of her first blockbuster aerobics video, "Workout," Ms. Fonda still exercises daily. And after living in the spotlight for 60-plus years, the thrice-married-and-divorced actor has a sense of humor about life and love these days. She doesn't see another long relationship in her future, but that doesn't bother her. "I'm heading into 86. Nothing is going to be long," Ms. Fonda said from her home in Los Angeles. "I've made peace with that."
Here, she extols the virtues of yoga pants, kosher hot dogs, comfy shoes and taking it slow.
First thing in the morning, I play: Wordle. Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen got me into it. It's the only word game or puzzle I've ever done. I always get the word, but the other day I got it on the first try.
When you're 85, you have to: do things slowly or you'll get hurt. I work out everyday -- one day I work my arms, and the next I work the back of my body. I have a trainer who specializes in people over 50, and she'll come to the house two or four times a week. I have weights and attach resistance bands to my banister. If, 10 years ago, I'd looked at what I do today, I'd say, "Are you kidding me? What a wuss!" Yes, it's a lot easier, but it's keeping me healthy.
My closet is: big and organized by purpose. Shiny clothes go in one section. Going-to-lunch-but-not-dressed-up goes in another. Evening clothes go here. I've always been pretty organized.
Yoga pants are: great because they don't have buttons or zippers. You can just pull them on. I wear them with a sweatshirt when I'm home, grocery shopping or out for a walk. I like Athleta yoga pants, but most of mine were my costumes on "Grace and Frankie."
I've hardly bought any: new clothes in years. I wear the same things, and my size hasn't changed. It's better to get a few good things that hold up than a lot of cheap stuff. I've had the same coat for 40 years. It'll never wear out. It keeps me dry and warm. It's black and nondescript. I can disappear into it.
Every day I put on: a pair of Marco Bicego gold earrings. They're very simple, burnished and about the size of my thumbnail. It's the only jewelry I wear.
One of my best friends was wearing: the greatest perfume, so I got it too. It's Frederic Malle's Portrait of a Lady by Dominique Ropion. It's fabulous. There's definitely a musky, sexy pheromone.
My favorite shoes are: comfortable ones. I wore a pair of white, fake-alligator Freda Salvador shoes with a strap in the back during a recent photo shoot. They were so comfortable I bought them in black.
I read: about three books a week, and a lot of those books focus on climate. Occasionally, I'll read a novel. "Ministry for the Future," by Kim Stanley Robinson, is about the climate crisis. It's very intense, but it's hopeful. Also, "The Overstory," by Richard Powers, is a remarkable book.
I used to love: the Ritz in Paris. I loved the sheets, the beds, the service, the food, the smell, the bar. But I don't go there anymore. It's too expensive.
I recently binge-watched: "Love and Death" on HBO Max. I don't necessarily like true crime, but I was blown away by the acting.
At least once a day I: meditate. I've studied Zen Buddhism and Transcendental Meditation, but what I've settled on is a mantra I repeat for 20 minutes. Very often solutions to problems arise while I'm meditating. I can't tell you what the solutions are. They're too personal.
Before I go to bed, I take off: whatever is on my face, whether it's makeup or dirt. I'm always looking for makeup remover that won't make my eyes burn. I'm still researching. I had cancer recently, and nobody told me that chemo f**ks with your skin. I realized, My God, I'm growing barnacles. So I'm paying more attention to what I'm putting on my face.
If I drink: I'll have a vodka martini with Chopin vodka. I don't drink much because I want to use every day I have left. If I have even one martini, I have to write the next day off.
The best pizza is: at Pizzana in Brentwood, Calif. Yes, I eat pizza. I get a truffle pie. I love truffles.
It's heresy but: I love a really good kosher hot dog. I know they'll take a half-hour off your life. The ones at the stadium where the Kansas City Royals play are good, too -- but they're not kosher.
I ate so much: ice cream while filming in Italy. We all did. At home, I'll have a vanilla Dove bar with dark chocolate, and I love sea-salt caramel Talenti gelato.
Relationships are: hard. I never really knew what a good one was supposed to look like. I know what it takes, but am I capable of it? No, I don't think so. I was with some incredible men. I wish I had been able to hang in there longer. I also chose men who were challenging. I think I'm over romance, and I'm sad. I was with some gorgeous men in Italy, but I was not tempted.
I'd like to visit: Lapland in Finland. I would like to talk to the reindeer herders and watch them work and see what's happening to the melting ice and snow. And I'd like to see the Aurora Borealis. I've been thinking about that a lot.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration proposed new rules to drastically reduce greenhouse gases from coal- and gas-fired power plants -- measures that will cost billions of dollars but that officials say will curb emissions that are warming the atmosphere and harming human health.
The proposed rules by the Environmental Protection Agency will raise average utility bills by 2% by 2030, declining to less than 1% by 2040, officials estimate.
"We feel really good that we have a negligible impact on electricity prices, but a significant impact on public health and climate benefits," EPA Administrator Michael Regan said at a briefing Thursday.
The new rules are likely to be another point of partisan debate over regulations designed to fight climate change and implement other progressive initiatives. Many Democrats are pushing the administration to do more, while Republicans are fighting the administration's initiatives both in Congress and at the state level.
Critics say the proposed rules are too draconian and will hurt coal-mining areas such as West Virginia where the economy is tied to fossil fuels.
"The Clean Power Plan 2.0 announced today is the Biden administration's most blatant attempt yet to close down power plants and kill American energy jobs," said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.).
Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) also opposed the new regulations and said he would block votes on any EPA nominees who come before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which he is the chairman.
The Electric Power Supply Association, an industry trade group representing power suppliers, said the new rules come as rising demand, retirements of existing generating units and changing weather patterns are stressing the nation's electric grid.
"Aspirational policy is getting ahead of operational reality," said EPSA President and Chief Executive Todd Snitchler.
The proposed rules now undergo a two-month public comment period, in which changes could be made before final adoption.
Under the EPA's proposal, utilities would begin phasing in the lower air-pollution targets in 2030 and have until 2042 to fully comply with the proposed standards. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, the rules would also cut emissions of unhealthful nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide from coal-burning plants.
Mr. Regan said he expects to see some coal plants close down because they won't be cost-effective to operate under the new standards.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the rules don't go far enough to protect minority and low-income communities that it says have borne the brunt of air pollution because of their proximity to power plants and other industrial sources of pollution.
Other green groups praised the EPA. "Cutting carbon emissions from the power sector is essential to keeping our climate goals within reach," said Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, a San Francisco-based environmental organization.

Full text: Short selling is back in vogue on Wall Street, rewarding some who bet against banks while triggering a backlash.
Short selling, or betting that securities prices will fall, surged over the past year as many investors braced for market turbulence. The approach helped hedge funds beat major stock indexes last year for the first time since 2008.
Controversy erupted in recent weeks, with critics alleging that traders are spooking bank customers into withdrawing deposits all at once. Lawyers representing the banking industry called last week for regulators to ban short sales of financial-company shares.
The Securities and Exchange Commission isn't considering a ban, a spokesman for the agency said. A shorts ban enacted in 2008 by the SEC failed to stop the selloff and made it harder to trade in some stocks, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Short sales of financial stocks jumped about 11% in April without significantly moving share prices, according to stock data provider Ortex. The inverse held in May when shorts declined and regional-bank stocks lost about 10%.
Porter Collins, a co-founder of Seawolf Capital, said his fund opened short positions on banks such as First Republic Bank last year as interest rates rose, pushing down prices of bonds that the banks held.
"Anything and everything was right in front of you on the financial statements as to why these banks have failed," he said. "It was just a math equation."
Short sellers typically borrow securities for a fee and immediately sell them, planning to repurchase them at lower prices in the future, return them to lenders and pocket the price difference. Other short sellers buy options or swaps that will gain value if prices of stocks or bonds they reference decline.
When Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse failed in March, hedge funds such as Beach Point Capital Management, Converium Capital, ISO-MTS and Saba Capital Management LP benefited from trades they had previously made against European bank bonds, people familiar with the firms said. More recently, funds like Seawolf and Lake Cornelia Research Management have been profiting from short selling shares of U.S. regional banks.
The short interest, or percentage of shares sold short, has been highest for First Republic Bank and PacWest Bancorp, exceeding 15%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Short interest also jumped for a handful of others, including Metropolitan Bank, Bank of Hawaii, Zions Bancorp, Customers Bancorp and SouthState Corp.
Still, financials were one of the least shorted industries at the end of April, averaging 1.7%, or half the short interest on technology stocks, according to data from S&P.
Shorts on technology stocks and Treasurys, another popular bearish bet, soared in March as investors sought safety from the banking rout. Macro hedge funds that shorted Treasurys because they expected interest rates to continue rising took heavy losses.
"We're definitely seeing more activity on the short side than over the past decade," said Aaron Steinberg, head of prime services sales at Pershing, a Bank of New York Mellon unit that supports hedge funds.
Beach Point Capital Management fund manager Ben Hunsaker started buying derivatives about a year ago that would gain value if prices dropped on bonds from banks such as UBS Group and Deutsche Bank. He thought the banks were exposed to fallout from commodity inflation caused by war in Ukraine and from the potential collapse of Credit Suisse.
By early March, credit-default swaps on European banks comprised one-quarter of all short bets in his $3 billion asset-backed bond portfolio. The portfolio gained roughly 1% overall in March, after Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse failed, according to a person familiar with the matter. Hedge funds lost about 0.7% on average that month, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, as the bank turmoil caused stock and bond prices to swing wildly.
Hedge funds originally got their name for using shorts to hedge, or offset, potential losses from "long" bets that prices will rise. Such "long-short" funds gradually lost popularity post-2008, when low interest rates sent equity and debt prices mostly up and traders adopted aphorisms like "don't fight the Fed."
The meme-stock rally of 2020 added insult to injury. Amateur traders championed companies like GameStop and Eastman Kodak, punishing short-selling hedge funds that expected their stocks to fall.
Many investors who specialized in shorting scaled back or shut down their operations. Even when correct -- GameStop and Kodak stocks are down about 75% from 2021 highs -- their analysis was often overpowered by market ebullience.
Now that monetary policy is tightening, investors increasingly want shorts to cushion themselves against volatility caused by geopolitics, macroeconomics and global climate change. Hedge funds lost a modest 4% last year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, while the S&P 500 index fell 18%.

Full text: The booming market for carbon credits could go mainstream under a plan to make it easier for financial firms to create products such as exchange-traded funds.
State Street will begin providing its back-office services to clients that want to invest in carbon credits.
The giant custody bank and fund administrator says the move will make it easier for big investors to trade the products, a key step toward making them a mainstream investment accessible to individuals.
There are two main types of carbon investments: Mandatory markets in places such as Europe and California where polluters are required to buy carbon allowances to account for their emissions and voluntary markets where companies buy credits to effectively offset their own carbon footprints.
Voluntary credits are tied to funding projects that reduce emissions or remove them from the atmosphere such as new renewable-energy installations or forest preservation. The voluntary market is much smaller but growing quickly. It has been plagued by questions about credit quality.
Both types of credits have become more popular investments in recent years as prices in Europe's mandatory market have risen and big U.S. companies have turned to voluntary offsets to meet their climate goals.
Because there is no global carbon price, higher prices for allowances in mandatory markets and voluntary credits are seen as some of the best ways to force companies to reduce pollution and meet the world's emissions targets.
The total value of global carbon markets rose nearly fivefold in four years to hit roughly $950 billion last year, with Europe accounting for most of that total, according to data provider Refinitiv.
State Street says it will now provide its usual custody and fund administration work for carbon markets, including handling and valuing assets, gathering prices and maintaining investment records for both the mandatory and voluntary markets.
The company is providing the financial plumbing in response to client demand, executives said.
"The more you see the physical impacts of climate change, the more people will bet on the scarcity of these carbon allowances and voluntary credits and higher prices," Antoine Delporte, a product manager on State Street's asset services team, said. "We want to be ready for the demand we see emerging."
In addition to asset managers, State Street plans to work with hedge funds and private-equity firms that also want easy access to carbon-credit investments.
The largest Wall Street firms are under pressure to direct more money into the transition away from fossil fuels.
State Street is betting its experience overseeing some $38 trillion in assets under custody or administration will give clients confidence to invest in the space.
There are currently only a few investment funds in the carbon market including the KraneShares Global Carbon Strategy ETF and SparkChange Physical Carbon EUA ETC, both of which are heavily or completely invested in the European allowances.
The KraneShares ETF holds futures contracts offered by Intercontinental Exchange that are linked to the underlying allowances, while the SparkChange product holds allowances directly.
Futures contracts allow the holder to buy or sell at a specific date in the future and are used by speculators to wager on price movements and by companies to protect against disadvantageous price swings. They are critical to developing robust commodity markets.
State Street says it will support funds that hold either allowances or futures. It hopes to become a leading player in the voluntary market, which has been riddled by concerns about credit quality and a lack of transparency.
Exchange operator CME Group recently launched futures contracts tied to voluntary offsets and is working with registries that uphold project standards and certify offsets.
As with other commodities, carbon-credit prices are volatile. European allowance prices crashed at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and after Russia invaded Ukraine, then surged to 100 euros (about $110) a metric ton for the first time ever earlier this year.
Luke Oliver, head of climate investments at KraneShares, said many investors want carbon products even though reduced demand for risky investments has prompted short-term outflows from such funds. The firm's Global Carbon Strategy ETF has about $600 million in assets after launching three years ago, down from a peak of about $1.4 billion last year.
Proponents argue that carbon is attractive especially to those seeking to bolster their green credentials, because prices have to move higher over time to fight climate change.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The World Bank's executive board approved Ajay Banga as its next president on Wednesday, putting the India-born American businessman in charge of an effort to expand lending capacity and fight climate change.
Mr. Banga, who was nominated for the post by President Biden, is serving a five-year term starting June 2. He is succeeding David Malpass, a Trump nominee who is stepping down a year before his term ends.
The 63-year-old Mr. Banga is a former chief executive of Mastercard who also held leadership roles at Citigroup and PepsiCo.
He arrives at an institution trying to balance competing priorities. The U.S. and other wealthy nations have been pressing the bank to lend more money to programs that would fight climate change, but have been reluctant to contribute more funds.
They have pushed the bank instead to tolerate more risk by making additional loans with its existing funding.
Mr. Biden called Mr. Banga a transformative leader.
"Ajay will also be integral in bringing together the public and private sectors, alongside philanthropies, to usher in the fundamental changes in development finance that this moment requires," Mr. Biden said.
Many developing nations are cautious of the climate effort, worrying that it might result in fewer resources for alleviating poverty and other economic development programs.
Developing nations were hit particularly hard by the pandemic and higher food and energy prices, and they are struggling with ballooning debt loads. The pandemic increased the number of people living in extreme poverty for the first time in at least four decades, according to the World Bank.
In an interview last month, Mr. Banga endorsed the view of officials from the U.S. and other major nations who say the bank can spend more to fight climate change without compromising its core work to help the poor.
"My logic is that the climate aspect is not separated from development," Mr. Banga said.
Mr. Banga has said he supports the idea of having the World Bank take on more risk and leverage its existing assets to raise more funds. But he has also noted that, given the potentially trillions of dollars needed to address climate change, the lender must find ways to encourage the private sector to channel more funds to clean energy projects around the world.
"The World Bank can play a central role in this effort by using its resources and itspolicy know-how to more effectively catalyze private capital," he said during an April speech. "We need to getthe private sector to be a constructive player in this mission. "
The U.S., the largest shareholder of the World Bank, has traditionally nominated U.S. citizens as World Bank presidents. The practice has drawn the ire of developing nations, but Mr. Banga ran uncontested for president.
Russia abstained from voting to confirm Mr. Banga, breaking from the tradition of unanimous board support for a new president, according to people familiar with the situation. Mr. Banga is "starting off with full faith and confidence of the membership," a senior U.S. official said, noting that the support from the 25-member board was "very strong."
A Russian embassy spokesman didn't respond to a request to comment.
During the bank's semiannual meeting last month, member countries approved a plan to free up extra lending capacity of $5 billion a year by reducing the equity-to-loan ratio to 19% from 20%.
As it takes on that additional risk, the bank must also protect its triple-A status from credit-rating firms to raise funds at rock-bottom rates. Besides the capital it receives from member governments, the bank's primary sources of financing are the bonds it sells and interest it collects on loans.

Full text: NORFOLK, Va. -- This low-lying waterfront city rests in the most vulnerable place along the East Coast to rising sea levels, prompting billions in climate-infrastructure projects that have sparked debate about how best to protect neighborhoods.
To safeguard Norfolk, the city and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are leading a $2.6 billion, 10-year project that some other East Coast cities see as a model for pre-disaster coastal resilience. In nearby Virginia Beach, Va., residents in a referendum approved a $568 million bond to build tidal gates, pump stations and pipes to redirect water from heavy rainfall and tidal flooding. And communities are adapting their daily life in smaller ways, such as redirecting school-bus routes around tidal flooding.
"The alternative is to wait for the hurricane to hit us and then billions of dollars to get dumped in the community to fix it. That's the old model," said Kyle Spencer, Norfolk's chief resilience officer. "The new model is trying to get it done pre-disaster."
Officials in the southeast pocket of Virginia known as Hampton Roads, which includes Norfolk and Virginia Beach, are moving forward with the kind of multibillion-dollar projects that have stalled in cities such as Miami and New York. The flurry of activity -- along with local arguments over strategy and costs -- is expected eventually to be replicated along the East Coast.
Norfolk has the highest rate of relative sea level rise among Atlantic coastal communities, according to the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Its 235,000 residents are seeing more high-tide flooding, increasing bouts of heavy rainfall and the threat of a catastrophic hurricane storm surge.
The Army Corps plan in Norfolk is part of a broad push to fortify a region home to 1.8 million people and the world's largest Navy base. It calls for storm-surge barriers, about 9 miles of flood walls and levees, 11 tide gates and 10 pump stations.
Separately, the Navy is stepping up work to shield key infrastructure. At the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Va., crews recently completed a $48 million sea-wall project that officials say will defend a roughly 1,000-foot-long dry dock. Between 2000 and 2020, officials say, the shipyard was hit 42 times by water high enough to interrupt operations that include repairing submarines.
"These are some of the Navy's most critical assets," said Cmdr. Kendall Chapman, the shipyard's resident officer in charge of construction. "Extreme weather events put that at risk."
At Naval Station Norfolk, the Navy has elevated and expanded several piers where aircraft carriers and other warships dock. The base employs tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel, many of whom live in the area and periodically contend with flooded roads going to and from work.
"If we do nothing at all, 25, 50 years from now . . . a large portion of this base is going to be underwater," said Michael King, a Navy regional community plans and liaison officer.
The Virginia Beach referendum passed in 2021 with support from 73% of voters. The flood-control projects will cost the average homeowner $10 to $14 extra a month in taxes, city officials say.
On a recent morning, Bob Jennings watched construction cranes prepare the foundation for a new tidal gate he hopes will protect his suburban home. It is the first of 21 flood projects planned in Virginia Beach over the next decade.
Mr. Jennings, a 74-year-old retired operations manager, lost most of his furniture and personal belongings when remnants of Hurricane Matthew dumped 14 inches of water on Virginia in October 2016, inundating his home and forcing him and his wife to shelter upstairs for two days.
"We are worried it might happen again. These projects are going to give us options and time," he said.
Hampton Roads sits at the junction of three water bodies: Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries on the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and in the south, Back Bay, a watery finger of North Carolina's Albemarle Sound. The spate of climate-related infrastructure projects, under way and on the horizon, has made the region a leader in protective measures to lessen the impact of rising seas. Other East Coast cities, including Miami and Charleston, S.C., have been stuck in contentious debates on how best to protect their residents from the effects of climate change.
"We're about two years behind Norfolk," said Dale Morris, Charleston's chief resilience officer.
Jessica Whitehead, executive director of the Institute for Coastal Adaptation and Resilience at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, likens sea-level rise to a slow-motion disaster that can be hard to comprehend for residents and decision makers."It's the slow creep over time," said Dr. Whitehead, a meteorologist and lead author of the Northeast chapter of a congressionally mandated report on climate effects in the U.S.
Since 1969, sea levels at Norfolk's Sewells Point have risen at a rate of 0.2 inch a year, the fastest anywhere on the East Coast, according to a March report by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Some of the rise stems from the slow sinking of the ground from water withdrawals and geological processes, but climate researchers say warming ocean temperatures and changes in the Gulf Stream current are the main contributors.
Levels at the Norfolk tidal gauge have risen more than 18 inches since 1927 and are expected to go up an additional foot by 2050, according to NOAA.
Norfolk and the Army Corps outlined a coastal-resilience plan in 2019 after three years of study. At the time, the projected cost was $1.4 billion; it since has risen to $2.6 billion. The 2021 federalinfrastructure bill included an initial $400 million in construction funding, and that will reach $615 million when the city finishes assembling its 35% share. The city hopes the state of Virginia will pick up at least half its total $900 million-plus tab.
Many residents of the largely Black Southside neighborhoods are clamoring for more protection. They want structural barriers -- not the home elevations and basement fills the Army Corps settled on after applying a cost-benefit analysis.
"We don't want to be like the Ninth Ward was in New Orleans," said Sharon Hendrick, a civic league president.
On the other side of the Elizabeth River, Jim Gehman, 78, a retired architect who lives in upscale Ghent Square, backs the project but paused when asked if a sea wall's protections are a worthwhile trade-off if it means impeding someone's water views. "How you do it is going to be real important," he said.
His friend, retired surgeon Al Roper, said he didn't support the project in part because he isn't persuaded sea levels will keep rising.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court turned away appeals by oil companies seeking protection from potential liability under state laws for harms caused by climate change, a decision that at least for now allows a number of cases to move forward under state laws the industry sees as less favorable than federal environmental statutes.
Oil companies, among them Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell PLC, are facing lawsuits alleging varied environmental harms from greenhouse-gas emissions filed under state laws by Rhode Island and several local governments, including the city of Baltimore; Colorado's Boulder and San Miguel counties; Hawaii's Honolulu and Maui counties; and California's Marin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties.
The Supreme Court denied the industry petitions in a summary order Monday that as is typical contained no comment. Justice Samuel Alito didn't take part in the cases, likely because he owns shares in companies involved in the suits. In one case, Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc. v. Boulder County, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that he preferred to hear the appeal.
"This was the right decision, and it is time to prepare for trial," said Sara Gross, an attorney with the Baltimore City Law Department. "Since we filed this case nearly five years ago, the climate crisis has worsened, the costs to Baltimore taxpayers are skyrocketing, and the defendants have pocketed trillions of dollars in profits while trying to dodge accountability for their deception."
The Baltimore suit, filed in 2018 in state court, alleges that more than 20 energy companies promoted fossil fuels while concealing information about the harmful changes in climate they cause, including rising sea levels and extreme weather.
Theodore Boutrous, who represents Chevron in several of the disputes, said he was confident that the pending climate lawsuits would ultimately be dismissed.
"Climate change is an issue of national and global magnitude that requires a coordinated federal policy response, not a disjointed patchwork of lawsuits in state courts across multiple states," he said. "These wasteful lawsuits in state courts will do nothing to advance global climate solutions, nothing to reduce emissions, and nothing to address climate-related impacts."
An Exxon spokesman said the company would fight the suits, adding: "Today's decision has no impact on our focus to invest billions of dollars to leading the way in a thoughtful energy transition that takes the world to net zero carbon emissions."
"We do not believe the courtroom is the right venue to address climate change," a Shell spokeswoman said.
Since 2017, at least two-dozen lawsuits have been filed by states and local governments against oil companies. Lower courts largely have rejected industry motions to dismiss the cases or move them into federal courts the defendants believe may provide a legal advantage.
In 2021, the Supreme Court handed industry a procedural win when it ordered a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., to reconsider its decision to leave Baltimore's suit in state court. The appeals court in 2022 reaffirmed that ruling, which Monday's Supreme Court order leaves in place.
Also Monday, the justices agreed to hear a pair of cases over whether the First Amendment prohibits local officials from blocking individuals who posted critical comments from their social-media accounts. In 2019, a federal appeals court held that then-President Donald Trump couldn't block individuals from his Twitter account, but the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal as moot after his term ended in 2021.
The cases accepted Monday involve officeholders including school-board members from Poway, Calif., and the city manager in Port Huron, Mich.

Full text: European glaciers lost a record amount of mass over the past two years from a one-two punch of below-normal snowfall and warmer temperatures, said international climate scientists.
The retreating snowpack threatens supplies of freshwater to cities and farms throughout the Alps watershed, but it is also lengthening the region's summer tourism season.
The World Meteorological Organization, a scientific arm of the United Nations, said Friday that glaciers across Europe shrank from a combination of little winter snow and heat waves between May and September. In addition, dust blown from the Sahara in March 2022 landed on the snow, absorbing the sun's rays and increasing the amount of melting, the report said.
"Europe actually got hit hard both ways last year," said Blair Trewin, a climate scientist at the WMO and an author of the new report. "They had an unusually dry winter, which meant that you didn't have as much snow accumulating at high elevations as you normally would. But then they had a very hot summer as well."
For the first time since record-keeping began, no snow survived the summer melt season at some of the highest measurement sites. As a result, those glaciers lost their source of ice. Record temperatures were reported from the summit of Mont Blanc, which straddles France and Italy.
In Iceland and northern Norway, however, a cool summer led to more precipitation and a small gain in glacial mass, according to the report.
In 2022, Switzerland's glaciers lost 6% of their volume. Since 2001, those glaciers have shrunk by one-third, the report said.
In July 2022, a weather balloon launched from Payerne, Switzerland, detected air temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit at 17,007 feet, the highest altitude in the 69-year records have been kept and only the second time that the height of the 32-degree freezing line exceeded 5,000 meters (16,404 feet), the report said.
The WMO report found that concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gas reached record levels and contributed to warming of the land and ocean, melting ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels and acidifying oceans.
The WMO's data set of 40 reference glaciers throughout the globe for which there are long-term observations lost an average of 4.3 feet from 2021 to 2022. Since 1970, this group of reference glaciers have lost nearly 100 feet of thickness, according to the report.
Glaciers collect snowfall during the winter and release water during the spring and summer. Once the glacier is gone, residents lose a resource vital for drinking water, irrigation and the production of hydroelectricity, Dr. Trewin said.
This past winter, many European ski resorts faced a tough season because of the lack of snow.
For other businesses, the warming Alps mean a busier summer season. Euan Wilson runs mountain bike tours in some of the region's mountain passes.
Snow-covered trails that used to require waiting until August or September to be clear are now accessible in July.
"You can definitely see the difference," said Mr. Wilson, co-owner of H&I Adventures, based in Inverness, Scotland. "You can keep your guides busier and generate more income, but it comes with a massive downside, which is climate change."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Auto makers face steep challenges in transitioning the nation to electric vehicles to meet tougher tailpipe emissions standards proposed by the Biden administration on Wednesday -- with hurdles including consumer sentiment, supply-chain issues and an evolving network of public charging stations.
The Environmental Protection Agency's emissions proposal would apply to cars, sport-utility vehicles and pickups in the 2027 to 2032 model years, with the goal of jump-starting EV sales and phasing out internal combustion engines.
The proposal would be the nation's toughest-ever restrictions on car pollution -- and one of President Biden's most aggressive moves yet to combat climate change. He previously called for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric-powered by 2030.
Auto makers are already transitioning to EVs, but industry-group officials said meeting the new goals will hinge on a number of factors, among them consumer appetite for EVs.
"There's no question that's where we're going," said John Bozzella, president and chief executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the industry's top U.S. lobbying group. "How we get there, whether we have the necessary complementary conditions in the marketplace and in the industrial base to get us there are, I think, critical conditions that we need to continue to examine as we go through this rulemaking."
Republicans said many consumers can't afford the higher price of EVs.
In March, the average transaction price for an EV was $61,800, compared with $45,600 for vehicles with internal combustion engines, according to J.D. Power, an industry-research firm.
"The 'electrification of everything' is not a solution. It's a road to higher prices and fewer choices," said Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.).
Biden administration officials said the tougher pollution standards are needed to reduce the nation's dependence on fossil fuels that generate greenhouse gases.
"Time and time again, I think folks have bet against the ingenuity of American workers and American industry to continue to deliver products that will help us lead the world in the clean-energy economy," said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi in a call with reporters.
During the past two years of Mr. Biden's presidency, Mr. Zaidi said, the number of available EV models have doubled, as have the number of charging stations. At the same time, he said analyst projections for EVs were raised.
To help spur the transition, the U.S. is planning to spend $7.5 billion to expand the charging network as part of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed in 2021.
And next week, the U.S. plans to issue criteria for tax credits of up to $7,500 for consumers who buy qualified EVs, a measure funded by last year's Inflation Reduction Act.
The EPA's proposal Wednesday, which is expected to be finalized in the spring of 2024 following a public comment period, is designed to let auto makers meet performance-based standards and comply through a broad array of emission control technologies -- mostly electrification, administration officials said.
A separate proposal, covering medium-duty vehicles such as box trucks and school buses, is expected to electrify nearly half of those vehicles by the 2032 model year.
The EPA estimated the benefits of the proposals would exceed costs by at least $1 trillion, achieved through lower vehicle-maintenance costs, savings on fuel and by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
The proposal is expected to avoid 7.3 billion tons of carbon-dioxide emissions through 2055, EPA administrator Michael Regan said, which the agency said was the equivalent of eliminating all greenhouse-gas emissions from the U.S. transportation sector for four years.
Mr. Regan acknowledged concerns about the proposal but said the industry would have flexibility to achieve them. "We're giving the markets and the automobile industry and the private sector the options to choose on how we best move forward to reach these very, very, very ambitious climate goals that we must reach if we are to protect this planet," Mr. Regan said Wednesday.
But high costs remain a major factor for many buyers and polls show mixed results in consumer interest.
A Gallup poll released this week found 12% of Americans are seriously considering buying an electric car while 43% of U.S. adults said they might consider buying an EV. The poll found 41% unequivocally said they wouldn't.
Major auto makers have been charging forward to shift their vehicle lineups to include more battery-powered cars, powered by the success of EV leader Tesla Inc., and tougher tailpipe-emissions standards around the globe.
In 2021, General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Jeep maker Stellantis NV jointly agreed to target 40% to 50% of their annual U.S. vehicle sales to be electric by 2030, in line with the administration's goal at the time.
The revamped emissions standards were set in motion in a 2021 executive order from Mr. Biden, which set a target for electric vehicles, hydrogen-fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles to make up 50% of U.S. sales by 2030.
The executive order called for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to complete new corporate average fuel economy targets for model year 2027 and beyond no later than July 2024.
A NHTSA spokeswoman said the agency expects its CAFE rule to be proposed soon. The agency expects its proposed standards to align with EPA's emissions rules in terms of net effect to the industry, the spokeswoman said.

Full text: SYDNEY -- Northern Australia's tropical coast used to have a vast covering of lush rainforest that supported the cassowary, often called the world's most dangerous bird. Now, one organization is developing a program they say will encourage landowners to reforest the area and create a habitat for native species.
Their plan: Cassowary Credits.
"The idea of the Cassowary Credit was about bringing in the large-scale investment that's needed to really do that work to protect the valleys of the region from climate change," said Sarah Hoyal, biodiversity and climate leader at nonprofit environmental group Terrain Natural Resource Management, which wants to sell credits to investors that are valued by how much land is restored to its native state over time.
Australia's government has similar plans, albeit on a larger scale. On March 29, the government introduced legislation to create a nationwide market for so-called biodiversity credits, the first large advanced economy to undertake such an effort. Australia is betting that businesses will be hungry to buy credits as they face pressure from shareholders and customers to be more socially responsible. If the market flourishes, Australia could be a model for harnessing money from the private sector to reverse environmental losses, but the plan is facing skepticism from investors and industry groups questioning how the credits will be valued and what will drive demand for them.
"Until there is an economic return, you will not get investors coming to nature projects except on a philanthropic basis, or some early stage voluntary action," said Martijn Wilder, chief executive of Pollination, an advisory and investment company. The legislation is a good start, he said, but more needs to be done to show it can work.
Australia's government argues that the plan offers a way for companies to invest in managing the environment without having to buy land. The market will also give landowners extra income, overcoming one of the roadblocks to conservation, and create jobs for indigenous communities that become involved in restoring the land, said Tanya Plibersek, the country's environment minister.
Under Australia's plan, landowners would get a credit, in the form of a certificate, for conducting repair or preservation projects on their property. This credit can be sold on to businesses and individuals. To help these investors figure out how much each credit is worth, information such as how much land is being repaired or how long it will take will be disclosed.
The credits would be tracked via a public register and overseen by a regulator.
How Australia tackles these issues could offer lessons for other countries considering ways to prevent nature loss. The U.N.'s environmental arm estimates that $384 billion annually -- more than double current levels -- needs to be invested by 2025 to protect against climate, biodiversity and land degradation.
Australia's plan illustrates how some governments don't think they can fill the funding gap alone and want the private sector to step up. Conservation efforts have largely focused on national parks or wildlife refuges. But with more than 60% of land in Australia owned privately, officials say that is no longer enough.
"We live in the extinction capital of the world -- losing more mammals to extinction than any other continent," said Ms. Plibersek.

Full text: ATAFONA, Brazil -- Sonia Ferreira struggles to remember what this deserted fishing community near Rio de Janeiro looked like when she moved here some 50 years ago -- mostly because a good chunk of it is now at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.
The coastline is receding as much as 18 feet a year at the mouth of the Paraiba do Sul river in Atafona, home to 7,000 people, satellite images show. Between 1984 and 2016, some 550 feet have disappeared. Climate change has increased sea levels, scientists say, and most of the river's water has been diverted to nearby cities, farms and factories, thwarting its ability to push back the ever-higher waves that sweep away buildings, livelihoods and memories.
"You watch it happen in slow motion," said Ms. Ferreira, 78, surveying the rubble at the water's edge that had been the home where she raised three children. "You don't know when exactly your house will fall down but you know it will."
Atafona is an extreme example of the challenge that lies ahead in a country with some 4,600 miles of coastline, one of the world's longest. Environmental researchers say scores of other beachside communities face similar fates in Brazil, among the top 10 countries that will be most affected by rising sea levels, according to Climate Central, a research organization on climate science.
In tourist hot spots such as Joao Pessoa on the northeastern coast, hotel owners are begging the government to build artificial reefs to protect their beaches from higher tides.
In Sao Paulo state, rising sea levels combined with intense rains led to severe floods in February that killed more than 60 people and left thousands homeless, said Celia Gouveia Souza, a geologist and oceanographer at the government-backed Institute of Environmental Research.
"There was a huge amount of water trying to drain down the rivers into the sea just as the sea was rising to its highest point," she said.
In Atafona, the 2-mile-long stretch of beach south from where the Paraiba do Sul river meets the ocean resembles a war zone.
Atafona's problems have been compounded by manufacturing and agricultural development upstream. Decades ago, the Paraiba do Sul would thunder down the valley to meet the Atlantic, slowing the ocean's advance on Atafona.
But now, some two-thirds of the river's water is diverted upstream to supply the city of Rio de Janeiro, and by factories and farms along its 700-mile course. Deforestation to make way for nearby sugar-cane farms has damaged its banks, further reducing the river's flow.
"At the river's mouth, there has long been this battle between the river and the sea," said Eduardo Bulhoes, a marine geographer at Rio's Federal Fluminense University. The river -- now a slow-moving muddy stretch of water that is gradually getting saltier -- has lost.
Some 500 buildings have disappeared into the sea since the 1960s, said Andre Pinto, a historian and official at the Sao Joao da Barra municipality, of which Atafona is a district.
Ms. Ferreira's eyes welled up as she scanned the ocean's empty expanse for remnants of her past. "There used to be five blocks of houses that way . . . beautiful mansions, a church, places to eat crab and fresh fish where everyone would meet."
University researchers into coastal erosion have proposed everything from a giant stone wall to hold back the sea to an underwater blanket to hold the sand in place. There was also talk of adding to sand dunes and building 260-yard-long jetties out into the ocean.
"In the end, nothing was done," said Mr. Pinto, blaming Brazil's rigid environmental laws and infighting over which government entity would pay. He believes the best solution is to relocate people farther inland.
Marcela Toledo, environment secretary for Sao Joao da Barra, said the city hall was working with federal and state officials "to unify efforts," saying more needed to be done to address problems upriver.
Meanwhile, the municipal government has resorted to putting out more than a thousand sandbags every year to protect the most vulnerable properties -- a palliative measure Mr. Pinto said is about as effective as "trying to dry ice."
Some residents refuse to give up. Ms. Ferreira was recently hunkered down in an outbuilding she built behind her now-destroyed house. "Most people around here believe that this is all the will of God," said Ms. Ferreira. "I'm not one of those people, though," she said. "This was us, human beings, we did this."

Hackers Infiltrated Exxon Critics --- Charity of Rockefeller heirs, climate activists among those targeted by a for-hire campaign

Full text: In the midst of perpetrating what federal prosecutors say was a massive corporate hacking campaign, Israeli private detective Aviram Azari in 2017 received welcome news.
A group of hackers in India wrote him to say they had successfully infiltrated the email and social-media accounts of a group of environmental activists campaigning against Exxon Mobil Corp.
"On a happy note I would like to report some success below: Project Name Rainbow," the hackers wrote in electronic messages that were viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The messages included evidence of the successful intrusions, including screenshots of compromised email inboxes.
The messages along with court records reveal new details about the hacking campaign, including that thousands of individuals and companies were targeted and at least some of the attacks resulted in the hackers successfully gaining access to the private accounts of the victims and obtaining their passwords.
Among the targets was the Rockefeller Family Fund, a charity created by some of the heirs of John D. Rockefeller, who founded Exxon's forebear Standard Oil. The fund has for years been involved in campaigns arguing that Exxon hid from the public the full extent of what it knew internally about climate change and the role fossil fuels played in causing it.
Exxon has long denied those allegations.
An Exxon spokeswoman said the company "has no knowledge of Azari, had no involvement in any hacking activities and has not been accused of any wrongdoing. To be clear, ExxonMobil has done nothing wrong."
Mr. Azari pleaded guilty in April 2022 to participating in a hacking conspiracy, wire fraud and identity theft. After several delays, his sentencing was set for late March in federal court in New York, but was delayed once more last week at his request.
Federal agents arrested Mr. Azari in 2019 while he was on a family vacation in Florida. Since then, he has been held in a federal detention center in Brooklyn and the mystery has lingered about who Mr. Azari's clients were.
Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan haven't accused anyone of hiring Mr. Azari to hack the environmentalists and no one else has been charged publicly in connection with the case. In a court filing last year, prosecutors said his clients "included Israeli, European, and U.S. companies."
Last year, prosecutors notified some of the activist groups, including the Rockefeller Family Fund, that they were targeted or successfully infiltrated, according to documents viewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.
It couldn't be determined if the fund was successfully hacked. The hackers were able to access accounts belonging to employees of other groups that also have campaigned against Exxon, including Greenpeace, Public Citizen and 350.org, among others, according to the documents.
Mr. Azari's attorney, Barry Zone, said his client isn't cooperating with the investigation. The probe is ongoing, according to people familiar with the matter.
"My client accepted responsibility for what he did and he's sorry for the people who were affected," Mr. Zone said. "In terms of the level of magnitude of hacking, I consider my client to be a very small player in that realm."
Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, said he hoped Mr. Azari would disclose who hired him. "This defendant did not decide on his own to follow and target climate advocates in the U.S. from halfway around the world. He was clearly working for corporate actors in this country," Mr. Wasserman said.
According to court documents, Mr. Azari would provide the Indian hackers with information on the main targets for each hacking project as well as on individuals who were connected to the main targets, such as family, friends or co-workers.
The hackers would then send Mr. Azari periodic updates on their efforts. Through target lists and emails related to successful hacks obtained by investigators, prosecutors say they have determined Mr. Azari targeted thousands of individuals and entities.
In addition to climate-change activists, Mr. Azari also targeted hedge funds and other financial institutions.
Mr. Azari has admitted to prosecutors that one of his clients was the now-insolvent German payments company Wirecard, according to a person familiar with the case. The Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity group at the University of Toronto, said it found that hackers engaged in sustained targeting of short sellers, journalists and investigators working on topics related to Wirecard. In a previous statement, Wirecard said it "has at no time been in direct or indirect contact with a hacker group from India."
The government "does not know whether its information is complete," prosecutors wrote in a court filing. "Indeed, there are likely to be thousands of additional individuals and entities who were targeted during the course of the spearphishing and hacking scheme."
A common tactic of hackers, spear phishing is the use of phony messages designed to solicit personal information that can then be used to access private accounts.
The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office has focused some of its investigation on how a private email from Jan. 5, 2016, from one of the activists to other members of environmental groups, was eventually posted online, according to people familiar with the matter.
The email was sent to 16 people about a meeting that was to be hosted on Jan. 8, 2016, by the Rockefeller Family Fund to discuss efforts to sway the public that "Exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity (and all creation) toward climate chaos and grave harm."
The gathering was held as some of the groups were advising the New York attorney general on a lawsuit it later filed against Exxon in 2018 accusing the oil giant of misleading investors about the risks that climate-change regulations posed to its business.
Others who attended the meeting included climate activist and author Bill McKibben, a co-founder of 350.org, and representatives of Greenpeace and Public Citizen.
According to Citizen Lab, all of the email recipients were the target of spear phishing attempts shortly after the January meeting. The hacking attempts were conducted by an Indian company called BellTroX, according to Citizen Lab. BellTroX was also the firm hired by Mr. Azari, people familiar with the matter said.
The meeting was subsequently described in media reports, including in a Journal article in April 2016. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative media outlet, later published a copy of the private email about the January meeting on its website.
Recipients of the email told the Journal that they believed it was obtained through hacking and that everyone on the email had attested they didn't share it with a wider audience.
"We were pretty strict on who was joining and what we were sharing," said Jamie Henn, a co-founder and former communications director for 350.org who received the email and attended the January meeting. "We knew this was explosive material."
Eliana Johnson, the Washington Free Beacon's editor in chief, said in an email that the outlet stood by its reporting.
Exxon eventually cited the email on its website as evidence of "a coordinated campaign perpetuated by activist groups with the aim of stigmatizing ExxonMobil." Exxon's lawyers also have cited the email in briefings in court cases, arguing it demonstrated improper influence by the campaigners on prosecutors pursuing investigations into Exxon.
In his opening statement in the trial stemming from the New York attorney general's lawsuit, Exxon lawyer Ted Wells quoted the email and said it was part of a "vilification agenda."
"They want to talk about how they can get [activist groups] involved to advance that false agenda to try to perpetrate something false," said Mr. Wells, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, during the 2019 trial, in which a New York state judge cleared Exxon of fraud claims.
Mr. Wasserman, the Rockefeller Family Fund director, said Exxon has repeatedly used the email "to develop a convoluted and completely false story about how citizens working together to address climate change are somehow conspirators -- a fairytale meant to deflect attention from Exxon's internal corporate documents about the climate catastrophe they knowingly helped cause. It's like the arsonists trying to pin blame on the firefighters."
Exxon called Mr. Wasserman's statement "completely false."

Full text: UNITED NATIONS
Court Opinion Asked
On Climate Action
The countries of the United Nations led by the island nation of Vanuatu adopted what they called a historic resolution Wednesday calling for the U.N.'s highest court to strengthen countries' obligations to curb warming and protect communities from climate disaster.
The resolution was adopted by consensus and Vanuatu Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau called it "a win for climate justice of epic proportions." He reeled off a string of recent disasters including back-to-back Category 4 cyclones in his own country and record-breaking Cyclone Freddy that refused to leave southeastern Africa in recent weeks. "Catastrophic and compound effects like this are growing in number," he said.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday he hoped the opinion, when issued, would encourage nations "to take the bolder and stronger climate action that our world so desperately needs."
Vanuatu hasn't only faced the recent cyclones, it is also at risk of rising seas engulfing swaths of the islands.
Scientists say both extreme weather and sea levels have worsened because of climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The resolution specifically asks the court to pay particular attention to harms for small island nations.

PORTUGAL
No Terrorism Link
Suspected in Attack
Authorities in Portugal said Wednesday that the fatal stabbings of two women at an Ismaili Muslim center in Lisbon weren't being treated as a potential act of terrorism.
Investigators have found no indication the man detained in the knife attack was involved in extremist activities, Luis Neves, the head of Portugal's Judicial Police, said during a news conference.
"There is no sign whatsoever, not one, that suggests this person was radicalized," Mr. Neves said. "This is not being viewed as a terror crime."
Police said Tuesday they were investigating the stabbings as a possible terror act. At least one person was wounded along with the Portuguese staff members who died.
Local Afghan community representatives have identified the suspect as an Afghan refugee who was known to have psychological problems after his wife died at a refugee camp in Greece.
The man had integrated into Western life and exhibited no radical behavior in his habits, friendships or social-media communications, according to Mr. Neves.
Authorities said the suspect remained in police custody at a Lisbon hospital. Police reported Wednesday that he was shot when he ignored an order to surrender and advanced toward the officers who responded to the Muslim center.

PHILIPPINES
Large Drug Stash
Found in Tea Bags
Philippine police seized more than 500 kilograms (more than half a ton) of suspected methamphetamine concealed in tea bags Wednesday and arrested a suspected Chinese drug dealer in a northern mountain resort city, police officials said.
The drug seizure in Baguio city had an estimated street value of 4 billion pesos ($74 million) and was one of the largest in recent years, officials said.
A drug syndicate apparently hid the suspected drugs, locally known as shabu, in Baguio, a popular tourism destination, and not in metropolitan Manila because of a continuing drug crackdown in the capital region, Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos and police officials said.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in June, has vowed to press on with his predecessor's crackdown against illegal drugs but said it would be done differently and focus more on rehabilitating drug dependents.
Under former President Rodrigo Duterte, more than 6,000 mostly poor suspected drug dealers were killed in reported clashes with law enforcers. The widespread killings alarmed Western governments, including the U.S., and sparked an International Criminal Court investigation as a possible crime against humanity.

INDONESIA
FIFA Tournament
Is Stripped Away
Indonesia was stripped of hosting the men's Under-20 World Cup on Wednesday only eight weeks before the start of the tournament amid political turmoil regarding Israel's participation.
FIFA said Indonesia was removed from staging the 24-team tournament scheduled to start on May 20 "due to the current circumstances" without specifying details.
The decision came after a meeting in Doha between FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Indonesian soccer federation President Erick Thohir.
Israel qualified last June for its first Under-20 World Cup. But the country's participation in Friday's scheduled draw in Bali provoked political opposition this month.
Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation and doesn't have formal diplomatic relations with Israel, while publicly supporting the Palestinian cause.
Indonesia's hosting was cast into doubt on Sunday when FIFA postponed the draw.
It is unclear who could now host the tournament, which was scheduled to be played in six stadiums in Indonesia. Argentina, which didn't qualify for the tournament, reportedly is interested in hosting.
"A new host will be announced as soon as possible, with the dates of the tournament currently remaining unchanged," FIFA said.

Full text: JPMorgan Chase & Co. is expanding its private-equity investment team focused on sustainable-growth equity opportunities.
The New York bank recently appointed Alex Bell, who has nearly two decades of private-equity experience, as a partner on the sustainable-investment team within its J.P. Morgan Private Capital group. Mr. Bell joins from Tikehau Capital, where he spent about a year as head of the firm's North American private-equity climate practice.
Before Tikehau, Mr. Bell spent more than four years at Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, where he helped start a 500 million Canadian dollar (roughly $366 million) platform. The strategy invests in late-stage venture and early growth private-equity opportunities in energy transition, sustainable food and agriculture and industrial decarbonization.
JPMorgan's hiring of Mr. Bell, who is Hispanic, adds to one of the more diverse leadership teams in the growth-equity industry. The two co-heads of the bank's sustainable growth equity team, Osei Van Horne and Tanya Barnes, are both Black.
The bank set up the sustainable-growth team in January 2022 and said it would anchor its first sustainability investment strategy with a capital commitment of as much as $150 million, describing it as one of its largest commitments to an alternative-investment strategy. JPMorgan's alternative-investment arm managed $211 billion as of December in strategies such as private equity and credit, hedge funds and real assets.
Jamie Dimon, the bank's chairman and chief executive, named climate change and inequality as two critical issues as the bank in 2021 announced plans to finance and facilitate $2.5 trillion of investments over 10 years to address climate change and sustainable-development needs.
"The first area that is of particular interest to us is around climate-technology investing, particularly around decarbonizing industrials and heavy industries," Mr. Van Horne said. "Just to decarbonize the real estate, industrials, transportation and agriculture industries, which are responsible for 80% of [greenhouse-gas] emissions, that is a $1.8 trillion market opportunity."
The sustainable-growth team has made two investments so far. It led a $200 million investment in Arcadia Power Inc., a technology company aimed at fighting climate change, and a $42 million investment in MineSense Technologies Ltd., a startup looking to improve carbon levels across the metals-mining industry.
Investments geared to improving the environment, social conditions or corporate governance, ESG for short, have broad support among institutional investors. One recent survey showed that 93% of such investors said they would walk away from an investment if it posed an ESG concern, and 50% cited better performance as a key reason to incorporate ESG elements in investing, according to the poll from consulting firm Bain & Co. and the Institutional Limited Partners Association.
Other big banks are also looking to expand their reach into sustainability. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s asset-management arm last year made a $100 million growth investment in Recover Textile Systems SL, a company focused on sustainable fashion.
Some investors and limited partners have expressed concerns regarding the difficulties of measuring outcomes and goals for sustainable investing. The search for more clarity has driven investments in companies like EcoVadis SAS, which provides ESG ratings and benchmarking for businesses.
"We've really invested a lot in measuring both the carbon profile as well as the ESG-related characteristics of our investments," Ms. Barnes said, to address apprehensions around quantifying environmental and social impacts.
"We've worked with our own internal experts as well as gotten third parties to help us verify all the data that we're sharing out with our partners," added Ms. Barnes, who joined JPMorgan last year from Blackstone Inc., where she led the private-equity firm's impact-investing platform.

Full text: HOUSTON -- Wael Sawan knows he is about to make some people very unhappy.
The new chief executive of Shell PLC is in the midst of crafting his business plan for the London-based energy giant, including whether to increase oil production. Doing so would please many investors looking to build on last year's oil-and-gas bonanza, which produced record annual earnings for Shell.
But it almost certainly would generate howls of protest from environmentalists and other critics, including investors who want Shell to tackle climate-related goals more aggressively. Those investors argue a continued focus on fossil fuels endangers Shell's long-term prospects in a changing world.
Mr. Sawan says he is committed to lowering the company's emissions and helping develop a new generation of clean-energy sources. But that is not where the bulk of profits are right now.
"I fundamentally believe in the role of oil and gas for a long, long time to come," he said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal.
What's more, he said, he doesn't believe renewable- and low-carbon energy projects should be subsidized by Shell's fossil-fuel profits, but should deliver returns that merit continued investment on their own. "We're definitely taking a hard look at the portfolio," Mr. Sawan said.
All options are on the table, he said, including revising the company's 2021 forecast for an average 1% to 2% decrease in its crude output each year until 2030. Mr. Sawan also said he was weighingfurther exploration for new sources of oil and gas in areas where Shell doesn't currently operate.
He cautioned that Shell's production targets and other key decisions are still being debated by its executives and board. Whatever he decides, Mr. Sawan expects to be unpopular among some groups, and maybe factions of all of them.
"I think the heat will come no matter what I do," he said.
Shell has scheduled an update for investors on June 14.
Finding the balance between fossil fuels and lower-carbon alternatives is a big challenge facing the CEOs of the biggest energy companies.
The task is particularly acute for Mr. Sawan and Shell, Europe's biggest energy company, which moved to the U.K. after a Dutch court ruled in 2021 that it was partially responsible for climate change and must reduce its carbon emissions. Shell is appealing the ruling, arguing that it is being unreasonably singled out.
In the U.K. and European continent, governments are clawing back portions of record profits earned last year by oil-and-gas companies as energy costs soared amid Russia's war in Ukraine.
Less than a year ago, Shell's annual shareholder meeting in London was delayed by almost three hours by climate activists attending as shareholders, who glued themselves to chairs and chanted against the company's continued spending on fossil fuels.
Mr. Sawan, who joined Shell in 1997 at the age of 22, now becomes its public face.
Born in Lebanon, Mr. Sawan grew up mostly in Dubai and studied chemical engineering in Montreal. A dual Lebanese-Canadian national, Mr. Sawan is the first non-European CEO in Shell's history.
Mr. Sawan is considered by colleagues inside and outside the company to be a technically adept manager, including in his most recent job overseeing Shell's massive liquefied natural-gas business, typically its biggest cash engine. He also took over responsibility for renewables on his final stretch toward the CEO job.
In addition to Europe and the Middle East, he has worked on the U.S. Gulf Coast and run businesses including global deep-water operations and companywide oil-and-gas exploration and production, known as upstream. A pivotal time in his career, according to people who know him, came in 1999 when, after working his first couple of years in Oman, he considered leaving Shell to pursue his graduate business degree at Harvard University.
Andy Brown, at the time his boss and later head of all upstream production for Shell, said he persuaded Mr. Sawan not to leave, but to get his M.B.A. with Shell's support and then afterward to return to the company.
"It was clear that Wael was a great talent," Mr. Brown said. "When you're 24, it is about, is the guy smart and can he work through issues and problems?" He said Mr. Sawan was especially skilled at developing relationships with business partners and government officials.
Among the options under consideration is whether it might make sense for Shell to step up exploration for new oil-and-gas sources, Mr. Sawan said. That includes potentially looking far afield for new, untapped oil and gas sources in parts of the world known in the industry as "frontiers" because they lack production infrastructure that takes years, sometimes decades, to build into full production.
Shell said two years ago it plans to end all new frontier exploration by the end of 2025.
But oil demand is continuing to rise, and investors in global oil giants have rewarded companies -- including U.S. giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. -- for sticking with traditional fossil-fuel production.
Shell says it is ahead of its schedule on planned annual 1% to 2% crude-output cuts, from divesting or running off assets more quickly than expected.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Top progressive Democrats said they have disagreements with President Biden but remain staunch supporters headed into the 2024 election, after moves by the administration on issues such as crime, immigration and energy policy angered the party's left wing.
Mr. Biden sided with Republicans on overturning Washington, D.C.'s crime code, prompting howls from progressives for stepping on home rule, and the White House has drawn scrutiny for considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families who cross illegally into the U.S. The administration also approved the Willow oil-drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic over the objections of environmentalists.
Progressive lawmakers and activists criticized the moves, but the blowback has been limited. No major protests have emerged outside the White House, and there has been no talk of a serious primary challenger from the progressive flank. Many see Mr. Biden as critical to winning the coming presidential race and helping take back full control of Congress, even if they aren't always on the same page.
"I'm opposed to the Willow project, which will mean fossil-fuel drilling on federal land, and I do think the president will need to have a bold climate policy to mobilize young voters in 2024," said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), a progressive who is considering running for Senate next year. Still, on the presidential race, Mr. Khanna said: "I'll be backing him enthusiastically."
Progressives have been the loudest voices within the party on matters including policing, LGBT issues, economic opportunity and protecting the environment. Mr. Biden ran in 2020 as a seasoned centrist but has worked with progressives on many of their priorities -- including passing a bill designed to slow climate change and taking executive action to trim student loans.
"It's no secret that the president wasn't my first choice in 2020," said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) who leads the House progressives. But after working together she plans to support him in 2024. She said progressives will continue to "push where we need to push."
A recent NBC/PBS NewsHour poll said that 50% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House if Mr. Biden is the nominee, compared with 45% who think the party would do better with someone else. Mr. Biden is expected to formally announce he is running later this year.
The White House said it is in regular touch with progressive leaders on Capitol Hill. With House Democrats now in the minority, progressives are pressuring Mr. Biden to take more executive actions, bypassing Congress. Staff for the Congressional Progressive Caucus met with the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs on Tuesday to talk about their wish list, which includes a range of demands, from expanding worker overtime protections to declaring a national climate emergency.
Last year, progressives pressed Mr. Biden to cancel student loan debt. Ultimately Mr. Biden issued an executive order to cancel up to $20,000 in debt, short of what some progressives wanted. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the program by late June.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) both ran against Mr. Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary, proposing student-loan forgiveness and expanded government health coverage. They now back Mr. Biden if he seeks another term.
"I think what the progressive movement in the country has done is to show the political establishment that millions of people are tired of status quo politics," said Mr. Sanders. "Is he doing everything that I would like? No, but I think he has heard that message," he said.
"I thought they were wrong," Ms. Warren said of the president's recent moves on immigration, drilling and crime, while praising his actions on climate and corporate taxes. "Joe Biden and I don't agree on everything, but I'm really glad he's president of the U.S.," she said on NBC News.
The White House cited Mr. Biden's recently released budget, which proposes child care, paid leave and free community college, as showing shared goals. But the White House is also trying to take a tough line on issues such as crime and illegal immigration that Republicans make clear will be a focus in 2024.

Full text: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has triggered a debate over the best way to support unprofitable businesses that are developing new technologies.
When it comes to innovations aimed at climate change, some say government agencies should play a bigger role.
Before regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, it stood out as a lender to clean-energy companies such as residential-solar providers and fuel-cell makers, as well as developers of climate-related technologies like low-carbon cement.
The bank's loans to startups pale in comparison to the more than $1 trillion invested in such businesses by venture-capital firms during the past few years, according to research provider PitchBook Data Inc. The lender, however, provided an alternative to more expensive and dilutive equity capital, according to investment bankers serving the industry.
"For better or for worse, they played a unique role in the venture-financing space," said Jeremy Swan, a managing principal with advisory firm CohnReznick LLP.
Silicon Valley Bank's status as a federally insured depository institution has raised the question of whether it assumed too much risk by lending to early-stage and unprofitable startups. With largely unproven products, these companies often lack assets to pledge against a loan and rely on cash from venture investors, creating a mismatch between risk and return for a bank lender, said Bob Bartell, president of risk and financial consulting firm Kroll LLC's corporate finance business.
"It is pretty uncommon for a [commercial] bank to make a loan to an unprofitable business if it is not collateralized by a personal guarantee of a business owner or a corporate guarantee of a larger parent company," Mr. Bartell said. Lending without tangible collateral means "taking equity risk and getting paid debt returns," he said.
Government agencies, on the other hand, can represent a more suitable source of low-cost capital to risky businesses because the support they provide usually doesn't depend on profits, Arij van Berkel, a senior vice president of Lux Research Inc., said in a webinar hosted by the consulting firm.
"A government, or a government-affiliated organization, [has] other motives for taking a high risk," he said. "For example, they want to meet climate goals or they want to turn their economy into a circular economy."
Federal agencies provide seed capital that helps entrepreneurs start new businesses. But funding dwindles during the three to seven years it can take for a startup to become attractive to venture-capital and private-equity firms, said Rita Hansen, co-founder and chief executive of Onboard Dynamics LLC. The company develops portable units that help reduce methane emissions during natural gas pipeline maintenance and other activities.
Started at Oregon State University in 2013 with Energy Department backing through its Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, Onboard later received support from angel investors. Still, Onboard struggled to fund operations before private-equity firm BP Energy Partners bought a majority stake in the business less than two years ago, Ms. Hansen said. Onboard had a Silicon Valley Bank account, but the lender considered the company to be too young for a loan, she said.
"The government has an expectation that there's this big safety net of private capital that is going to catch all these new companies, but that's a big mistake," Ms. Hansen said.
Clean-energy companies deploying proven technologies, such as solar systems, have better chances of benefiting from recently established federal financial incentives in areas such as infrastructure, clean energy and chip manufacturing, said Peter Davidson, chief executive of Aligned Climate Capital, a clean energy-focused firm in New York. Before setting up Aligned in 2019, Mr. Davidson led the Energy Department's loan programs office during the Obama administration.
"There's massive new amounts of government assistance" becoming available under recently enacted laws, Mr. Davidson said.
He cited grants and loans offered by so-called state green banks as well as other federal sources such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Aligned Climate, for example, uses USDA loans to buy solar installations in rural areas.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden issued the first veto of his presidency Monday, rejecting a Republican-led measure that would overturn a regulation allowing retirement-plan managers to consider climate change in their investment decisions.
The bill would have overturned a Biden administration regulation on environmental, social and corporate governance guidelines, or ESG.
The bill passed the GOP-led House Feb. 28 on a vote of 216-204, with one Democrat joining with Republicans in support. The Senate on March 1 approved a companion measure on a vote of 50-46, helped by the support of two moderate Democrats from Republican-leaning states, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Montana Sen. Jon Tester.
Republican lawmakers targeted the Labor Department rule in question with a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act. It allows lawmakers to overturn a newly issued regulation on an expedited schedule with a simple majority vote in both houses of Congress.
Guidelines regarding ESG have been targeted by conservatives, who have been arguing they are part of an effort by progressives to promote "woke capitalism." Defenders of the regulation say ESG simply adds another factor for managers to consider when making investments.
"This bill would risk your retirement savings by making it illegal to consider risk factors MAGA House Republicans don't like," Mr. Biden said.
The veto is unlikely to be overridden in the narrowly divided Congress because that would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers. Democrats control 51 seats in the Senate.
Mr. Biden's first veto came at a similar point in his presidency as that of former President Donald Trump, who issued his first veto in March 2019 over a resolution that would have prevented him from funding a wall along the U.S. southern border without congressional approval.
Presidential vetoes have become less common in recent administrations. Former Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Mr. Trump each issued a dozen or fewer vetoes during their administrations, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In contrast, former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush each issued more than three dozen vetoes.
Mr. Biden has said he is prepared to deploy his veto pen if Republicans seek cuts to Medicare or Social Security or attempt to raisethe cost of prescription drugs.
His first veto stemmed from a more obscure issue. The Labor Department drafted a rule in November under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act allowing fiduciaries the right to consider climate change and ESG factors as they invested in privately held retirement plans. Considering ESG factors has become common in the finance world as hedge funds and investment firms have sought to address climate change and environmental impacts.
Republicans in recent years have targeted such investments, calling them irresponsible and part of a progressive agenda. Proponents of the bill said fund managers should be focused on investment returns rather than be driven by factors they term political.
Sen. Mike Braun (R., Ind.) said the ESG rule allows investment managers to push a political agenda at the expense of retirement savers receiving the best rate of return.
Democrats characterized the matter as a question of empowering Americans to make investment decisions.

Full text: A United Nations panel of scientists said there is a "feasible, but narrow pathway" to avoid the worst effects of climate change. However, to do so, the world's nations must together cut greenhouse-gas emissions 60% by 2035 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels.
That level of cuts would require a massive and rapid shift in the world's energy supply that is under way in some countries, but has been stifled by the war in Ukraine, the global energy crisis and thirst for economic growth in countries such as China and India. Global greenhouse-gas emissions reached record levels in 2022 and are projected to continue their upward trajectory, according to scientists.
The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday released a synthesis of the Sixth Assessment Report, which combines three working-group studies on climate science, adaptation and mitigation, as well as special reports on the oceans, land and reaching 1.5 degrees Celsius, the number that nations agreed to limit warming at the 2015 Paris climate summit to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
The authors said the climate-related effects are worse than had been projected in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment, released in 2014, and that future effects will include more heat waves, droughts, extreme rainfall, sea level rise and flooding across the globe. These effects are the result of more than a century of burning of fossil fuels, which has led global temperatures to rise 1.1 degrees Celsius since 1900, the panel said.
"We are seeing the science and the projections now starting to come true," said Benjamin Poulter, an earth scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md., who is an author on this IPCC report and the previous one. "The impacts are accelerating in a much quicker way, but at the same time, society has done absolutely nothing to stop the growth of greenhouse gas emissions."
Dr. Poulter said the report does have some good news. If nations are able to balance emissions and removals of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to achieve a "net-zero" state sometime around the middle of the century, the Earth's temperature could begin stabilizing a decade or so later, according to projections released today in the IPCC synthesis report. That's a more positive outcome than in previous studies, according to Dr. Poulter.
Other IPCC authors note that climate solutions -- from switching to electric vehicles to changing farming practices -- are becoming cheaper and more available.
Climate solutions also may have side benefits, according to Francis X. Johnson, a senior research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute and an IPCC report author. "Focusing on those benefits could be a more promising strategy," he said, noting that cutting industrial carbon emissions can reduce air pollution, and adding green space to cities can improve quality of life while absorbing rainfall and cooling the air at the same time.
The IPCC report said that greenhouse-gas emissions will have to be counterbalanced by carbon dioxide removal methods, such as capturing carbon emissions from factories and storing them safely underground, using filters to scrub carbon dioxide directly from the air, or convincing farmers to capture more carbon in their fields.

Full text: MONTLUEL, France -- A rainy, cool climate has sustained fisheries in this region north of Lyon for eight centuries, filling up hundreds of man-made ponds that are France's main source of freshwater fish.
This year, however, many of the ponds are nearly empty after an exceptionally dry and warm stretch of weather that has lingered across much of Europe since last summer. The farmers expect to raise half as much fish as they did last season and lay off workers who usually help with the catch.
"It's really a catastrophic situation for us," said Michel Grange, director of a cooperative of fish farmers in the Dombes region. "Only 50% of the ponds can now be filled with fish. The rest aren't worth it because they'll be dry all summer."
Europe is in the midst of a drought that is hitting the continent's economy, from agriculture and power generation to shipping. It began last summer with hot weather and lack of rain, and then continued this winter with long dry spells in Western Europe.
Barely a drop of rain fell in France from mid-January until the end of February, the longest dry spell since records began in 1959. Dry conditions have been fueling wildfires in the Irish countryside. In Italy, parts of the Po River have been reduced to large puddles, one reason why the canals of Venice, which are fed by the Po, have run nearly dry.
Climate scientists studying the drought say certain features are caused by man-made climate change, drawing on the conclusions of the latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In particular, higher temperatures across Europe increase water evaporation, drying out soil and aquifers. There is also evidence that climate change is reducing summer rainfall in Western and Southern Europe.
"The heat -- mean temperature, the excessive temperatures, the extremes -- are all changing very fast in Western Europe with climate change," said Robert Vautard, director of the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace and an expert in the regional impacts of climate change.
Some scientists say this winter's drought is a sign that climate change is pushing weather toward the extremes, with long dry spells offset by short periods of intense rain.
"The impacts of having these extreme periods might be enormous," said Andrea Toreti, a climate scientist at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.
Last summer's drought hit Europe's energy supplies as Russia cut natural-gas deliveries to the continent because of the war in Ukraine. Hydropower generation across the European Union fell 19% to its lowest level in two decades. France lowered output at some nuclear reactors because their exhaust water into rivers made them too warm, threatening wildlife.
Meanwhile, the drought significantly pushed down yields of maize grain, sunflowers and other summer crops.
The lack of rain and snow this winter has prevented Europe's aquifers, ponds and rivers from being replenished for the summer months, scientists say. French authorities said Monday that 80% of the country's aquifers are at low or very low levels. The snowpack in the Alps also is low, meaning the spring melt could deliver a relatively limited infusion of water to the continent's rivers.
Local officials in the hardest-hit areas of France are preparing to order farmers to cut back on irrigating their crops.

Full text: UTQIAGVIK, Alaska -- Nestled between the whalebone-marked graves of long-dead whaling captains, an arctic fox den and a snow-covered beach, a series of satellite dishes point at the horizon from this northern Alaskan town.
Far from the superfast fiber-optic cables that provide internet connectivity to other parts of the world, Arctic towns like Utqiagvik have typically relied on more limited, less reliable satellite connections. It means that students can rarely stream educational videos, hospitals spend hours uploading medical scans and scientists sometimes struggle to simply open emails.
The Arctic is one of the world's last digital frontiers. Subsea fiber-optic cables, which carry over 99% of intercontinental voice and data traffic, have traversed most of the world's oceans, but so far not the Arctic Ocean, historically limited by the region's ice sheet.
As that ice sheet has started melting due to climate change, telecommunications companies have looked to the area -- where Asia, Europe and North America are closer than they are at any other point on Earth -- for a shorter, potentially more efficient route for data flows across the three continents.
"Climate change is even making it technically all the time easier," said AJ Knaapila, president and chief executive of Finnish telecommunications, cybersecurity and software company Cinia Oy, which, along with partners, hopes to build a submarine fiber-optic cable through the Arctic in coming years, a project estimated to cost roughly $1.2 billion.
An Arctic route would offer the shortest connection between London and Tokyo, carrying implications for industries like financial trading, where milliseconds can make the difference between profits and losses. It would also bring much-needed connectivity to rural northern towns like Utqiagvik, formerly Barrow, transforming one of the least digital regions to a major digital crossroads.
Cinia in the past year and a half formed a joint venture with Arteria Networks Corp. of Japan and Alaska's Far North Digital LLC on the project. The current estimate for the length of the cable stands at about 10,500 miles, although the final length could vary, according to Alcatel Submarine Networks, the Nokia Corp. subsidiary contracted by the joint venture to lay the cable.
With a route survey beginning this year, the cable system is scheduled to be operational in 2026. But when asked about the likelihood of that timeline being met, a Cinia official expressed uncertainty.
"If you ask four of us, you will get four different answers," said Taneli Vuorinen, Cinia's executive vice president of Global Connectivity.
Cinia, which is owned 77.5% by the Finnish government, is already a veteran of one failed effort. In 2019, Cinia partnered with Russian company MegaFon on an earlier project designed to route cable east from Europe over the Russian Arctic to Asia. It fell apart in 2021 after the Russian government's support of the project started to fade and the geopolitical risks of operating a data flow so close to Russia felt too high, Cinia said.
The company packed up its research and partnered with Arteria and Far North Digital on the new cable project, going west from Europe, through the Northwest Passage in Canada, over Alaska and landing in Japan.
The cable must earn more than $80 million annually during its roughly 25-year lifespan to be profitable, Cinia said.
The partners are self-funding the project with revenue from other areas of their business, while they search for funding from outside investors and future customers. Before survey work can begin later this year, the companies say they need to sell about half the capacity.
The potential for low-latency communications is one of its biggest selling points, according to Mr. Knaapila. A bank in London transmitting data to Tokyo could do so 30% to 40% faster via an Arctic route than through existing subsea routes -- a roughly 35-millisecond advantage one way -- according to Tim Stronge, an analyst at subsea cable analysis firm TeleGeography.
Nearly all subsea cables that connect Asia and Europe go through Egypt, but that path is also a common route for shipping, which is the second most common cause of cable failures, said Paul Gabla, chief sales and marketing officer at Alcatel Submarine Networks. The most common cause is fishing activity, he said. The Arctic offers minimal shipping traffic or fishing activity, and in the winter, the ice sheet would protect it from human-caused damage, he said.
The same ice also limits construction. While climate change has made the Arctic warmer and rainier, work on an Arctic cable could be completed only during summer months when the ice sheet dissipates, Mr. Gabla said.
Maintenance presents another issue. It makes potential customers nervous. Takahiro Sumimoto, senior vice president of marine cable for NTT Ltd., a London-based IT and infrastructure company owned by Japanese holding company Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., said that if the cable breaks during the winter months, users might have to wait months for it to come back online.
"You can guess that it's tough to access there. And are you able to pick up the cable from the seabed? If it's frozen, you can't," he said.
Too much customer hesitation could bring the project to a halt. Cinia, Arteria and Far North Digital are wooing other telecommunications carriers, global data center operators such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Microsoft Corp., and research and education networks.
So far, the joint venture has published one signed letter of intent from NORDUnet, a collaboration of the National Research and Education Networks of the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland. NORDUnet has said it would use one fiber pair -- between 6.25% and 8.3% of the total cable system's capacity. Some carriers, including Verizon Communications Inc., Orange SA and NTT say they would be interested in evaluating the system once it is built, but there is a hesitation about jumping in early.

Full text: Sustainable funds that invest based on factors such as companies' carbon footprints and workforce diversity attracted new investment in 2022, despite a broad market selloff that punished many sectors.
Investments into U.S. sustainable funds including stocks, bonds and other categories fell to $3.1 billion in 2022 from $69.2 billion a year earlier, according to Morningstar. Conventional funds that don't consider environmental, social or governance factors, also known as ESG, suffered more than $370 billion in withdrawals last year.
Fixed-income funds accounted for $2.4 billion of all sustainable investment inflows, or about 75%, a surprising performance given how rising interest rates have punished many bondholders. Morningstar identified 129 sustainable bond funds last year, up from 47 in 2018.
Sustainable products benefit from a flood of capital chasing greener investments in response to a warming planet, while governments and regulators increasingly are setting ambitious climate targets pushing companies to shrink their carbon footprints.
"Investors are experiencing more and more the first or secondhand effects of climate change and societal inequality, and that's driving their desire to want to have a positive impact," said Morningstar's associate director of sustainability research, Alyssa Stankiewicz.
Some of the sustainable fixed-income funds with the largest inflows invest directly in renewable energy, low-carbon transit alternatives and other sustainable projects.
The Calvert Bond Fund drew in $413 million in investment in 2022, the third-highest inflow of any sustainable bond fund last year, according to Morningstar. The fund, with $2.6 billion in assets, outperformed its benchmark because of a shorter duration, or investing in securities less sensitive to interest rate changes, and overweighting asset-backed securities including those for renewable energy projects, according to its annual report.
"Almost a third of the fund has a very clear use of proceeds on bonds where you can literally point to a project where investors are helping to support direct positive impact from an environmental or social perspective," said Calvert Research & Management's Anthony Eames, managing director, responsible investment strategy.
The Hartford Schroders Sustainable Core Bond Fund netted $109 million last year despite underperforming its benchmark. The fund has $175 million in assets and held more corporate bonds than the benchmark including those from financial firms, according to its annual report.
Inflows were likely driven by investors reallocating capital into sustainable products with similar performance to conventional funds, said Lisa Hornby, portfolio manager for the Hartford Schroders Sustainable Core Bond Fund.
Most sustainable funds underperformed their non-ESG counterparts in 2022, according to Morningstar. A variety of factors detracted from the performance of fixed-income funds including greater exposure to long duration, overweighting securities from corporations hard hit by the downturn and underweighting energy firms that performed well last year, according to a Wall Street Journal review of annual reports.
The bond market hemorrhaged cash last year, leading to a historic rout as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to their highest levels in years in its fight to tame persistent inflation. Conventional-bond fund outflows hit $335 billion last year, according to Morningstar. Yields climbed, pushing borrowing costs higher, which also tempered issuance, yet sustainable-bond offerings beat conventional peers' issuance.
"Last year in particular, sustainable bonds held up better than the broader market," said Matt Kuchtyak, vice president of sustainable finance at Moody's Investors Service.
Sustainable fixed-income funds sometimes buy green bonds and use climate and social scores from ESG raters to screen corporate issuers for risks, similar to equity-based funds. ESG scores vary widely among raters and many funds have discretion to invest in companies with significant carbon footprints.
ESG investing is under pressure from all sides. Republicans are working to prevent investors from considering climate and social risks in their decisions. Investors and observers are increasingly scrutinizing the market as some offerings overstate their climate bona fides, also known as greenwashing.
Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed tightening rules around ESG-related offerings that could lead to additional disclosures and product names that better reflect their mandates.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted to overturn a new Biden administration regulation that would allow retirement-plan managers to consider climate change and other factors when they make investment decisions, setting up what could be President Biden's first veto.
The Senate action on Wednesday, with 50 in favor and 46 against, comes a day after the House voted to toss the regulation on environmental, social and corporate-governance guidelines, or ESG, by a vote of 216-204.
Two moderate Democrats from GOP-leaning states, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Montana Sen. Jon Tester, voted in favor of the measure, which was introduced by Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun.
The measure now heads to Mr. Biden's desk. The White House has said that the president would veto it.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the bill in question would give investment professionals "less flexibility to make prudent decisions" and "forces MAGA Republican ideology down the throats of the private sector."
Republican lawmakers targeted the Labor Department rule in question with a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act. It allows lawmakers to overturn a newly issued regulation on an expedited schedule with a simple majority vote in Congress, rather than the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation.
Mr. Braun, speaking to reporters ahead of the vote, said the ESG rule allows investment managers to push a political agenda at the expense of retirement savers. "That is government in overdrive," he said.
In a statement, Mr. Tester said he is opposing the Labor Department rule because it "undermines retirement accounts for working Montanans and is wrong for my state."
In November, the Labor Department drafted a new rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act allowing fiduciaries the right to consider climate change and ESG factors as they invested in privately held retirement plans. Considering ESG factors has become common in the finance world as hedge funds and investment firms have sought to address climate change and environmental impacts.
The new rule reversed a move by the Trump administration in 2020 that made it harder for 401(k) plans to put ESG investments on the menu. That regulation went into effect shortly before Mr. Biden took office, but the administration moved to replace it.
Advocates say that addressing climate change, improving corporate governance and encouraging diversity can boost profits. Data, they say, suggest that socially responsible investments can provide competitive returns. Conservative critics and some regulators have raised concerns about these claims.
The Securities and Exchange Commission last year established an enforcement task force to pursue cases against public companies or fund managers that mislead investors about strategies to address climate-change risks.
Republicans have accused investors of trying to force companies to follow a liberal agenda at the expense of a pursuit of profit. In recent months, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials banned state pension-fund managers from incorporating ESG factors into investments.
Democrats, meanwhile, said GOP officials' obsession with eliminating ESG runs counter to their free-market principles.

Full text: A group of large European Union countries is threatening to block a plan by Brussels to effectively ban the internal combustion engine, endangering the bloc's ambitious agenda to combat climate change.
Germany and Italy said this week they could block the plan's formal approval at crucial meetings this week and next. Berlin said it would oppose the plan unless Brussels agrees to allow so-called synthetic fuels that can burn like gasoline and diesel but spew fewer climate-damaging emissions alongside fully electric vehicles.
Under the leadership of the European Commission, the EU's executive body, Europe adopted an ambitious plan to fight climate-change-causing greenhouse-gas emissions. The plan relies on the mass adoption of electric vehicles and effectively bans new combustion-engine vehicles from 2035.
Parts of the auto industry, which employs 3.4 million people in the EU -- nearly 12% of all manufacturing jobs -- pushed back, arguing that including so-called e-fuels into the plan would allow emission targets to be hit while stretching the costly move away from combustion engines over decades.
Some governments expressed sympathy with the demand as the move to electric vehicles, which are less complex to produce than their combustion rivals, threatens large numbers of jobs in the region.
Under a compromise reached last October, lawmakers agreed that the European Commission could put forward additional rules allowing new vehicles with engines that use carbon-neutral fuels to continue to be sold, but it has yet to do so.
German Transport Minister Volker Wissing on Tuesday said Berlin wanted Brussels to present this legislation ahead of the plan's approval, saying that because it had yet to do so, "the German government cannot approve the compromise."
Italy's Environment Ministry said environmental targets should be pursued in a way that avoids harming jobs and production and electric vehicles shouldn't be seen as the only route to zero emissions.
Two other countries pushed back on the legislation. Poland informed other member states it plans to vote against the plan, and Bulgaria indicated it plans to abstain, four EU diplomats said. Poland's government previously said such a ban would restrict consumer choice and lead to higher costs. By acting together, those countries have enough votes to block the plan.
A spokesman for the commission said it is up to the commission's political leadership to determine what legislation to propose and when to do so. "The transition to zero-emissions vehicles is absolutely necessary" to meet the bloc's climate targets, he said.
The European car sector and countries that have begun investing heavily in e-fuel development spearheaded the effort against the provision in the commission's plan stating that vehicles should be emissions-free by 2035 -- a de facto combustion-engine ban.
Germany, home to the region's largest car makers, said this week that it would soon approve the use of synthetic fuels, a move that would force Brussels to either follow suit or challenge the German law.

Full text: Electricians, the essential workers in the transition to renewable energy, are in increasingly short supply. They are needed to install the electric-car chargers, heat pumps and other gear deemed essential to address climate change.
Electricians say they are booked several months out and struggling to find enough workers to keep up with demand. Many are raising wages and prices and worried that they won't be able to keep up as government climate incentives kick in.
"I'm tired of telling people I can't help them," said Brian LaMorte, co-owner of LaMorte Electric Heating & Cooling in Ithaca, N.Y., which does residential heat-pump installations and electric-service upgrades. His six-person company is booked roughly six months out, so he has been referring potential new customers to other firms in the area.
The 48-year-old brought on two apprentices last year and has seen the price of an average job rise to roughly $20,000 from about $16,000 two years ago due to rising raw materials, equipment and labor prices.
Dan Conant says he worries about getting enough electricians for his West Virginia renewable-energy company Solar Holler. The company started an internship program in partnership with a local high school and expects the state will need several thousand more electricians over the next decade."Ultimately, this is the bottleneck," Mr. Conant said.
The scarcity is part of a nationwide labor shortage and most acute in the Northeast and California, where demand for green-energy products is highest, in part due to state incentives. Some economists expect the pinch to spread across the country as incentives from the new federal law known as the Inflation Reduction Act kick in.
The current total of more than 700,000 electricians in the U.S. is expected to grow about 7% over the next decade, slightly faster than the nationwide average of 5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The shift to renewable energy and the need to update electrical systems is expected to drive that growth.
The BLS includes a separate category of solar photovoltaic installers, some of whom could also be electricians. Growth in that much smaller sector is expected to be above 25%.
Industry analysts say it will be difficult to meet that demand, particularly because more electricians retire every year than are replaced, and many retired during the coronavirus pandemic.
The median age of electricians is over 40 years old. But nearly 30% of union electricians are between ages 50 and 70 and close to retirement, up from 22% in 2005, according to the National Electrical Contractors Association.
The average annual electrician salary rose from roughly $50,000 to about $60,000 from 2018 to 2022, an increase roughly in line with the national average, according to the BLS.
The climate law will put several hundred billion dollars' worth of incentives into the economy designed to accelerate the energy transition and boost clean-energy supply chains in the U.S. The law followed an infrastructure spending package and incentives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing that are also expected to spur demand for labor and could end up pushing up total construction costs.
The impact of these policies differs from that of broad-based stimulus passed under the Trump and then Biden administrations in 2020 and 2021. Those packages raised demand across the board for goods and services. These latest policies are much smaller in total dollars, but also more focused, with their effects falling acutely on certain types of workers and products and in certain regions.
"There's not enough people to do all this," said Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who argues the programs should have been spread out over a longer period.
Product makers such as Schneider Electric SE are working to make simpler products and drive down installation times. The company has been investing tens of millions of dollars in expanding its product manufacturing in North America and partnering with trade associations on training programs for electricians who install them, said Michael Lotfy, senior vice president of power products.
On a recent week in Ithaca, three of Mr. LaMorte's employees were installing a heat pump for Matthew Minnig, a 40-year-old engineer. Mr. Minnig ordered the units in April, but was told installation would take several months. "There are times I can remember last summer thinking, 'We've already paid a considerable amount for this project, and I'm still sweating in my house,'" he said.
Jesse Kuhlman, owner of Kuhlman Electrical Services Inc. in Massachusetts, said the company's South Shore division is booked out to the summer, its longest such backlog in recent years. The company has been doing many more electric-car charger installations lately.
Mr. Kuhlman has tried to grow the company by training apprentices over time. "You can't just take people off the street and throw them into what we do," he said.

Full text: The House passed a Republican-led bill Tuesday disapproving of a new Biden administration regulation that would allow retirement-plan managers to consider climate change and other factors when they make investment decisions.
The legislation to overturn the regulation on environmental, social and corporate-governance guidelines, or ESG, passed 216-204. One Democrat joined with Republicans in support of the measure, which was introduced by Rep. Andrew Barr (R. Ky.).
Sen. Mike Braun (R., Ind.) has introduced a companion measure in the Senate, where Democrats have a 51-49 advantage, and the measure's fate is uncertain.
Unlike most legislation, overturning the ESG regulation would require only a simple majority to pass and then head to President Biden's desk, meaning Republicans would only need a handful of Democratic votes.
Mr. Biden has said he would veto the measure.
Last November, the Labor Department drafted a new rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act allowing fiduciaries the right to consider climate change and ESG factors as they invested in privately held retirement plans. Considering ESG factors has become common in the finance world as hedge funds and investment firms have sought to address climate change and environmental impacts.
Such investment efforts have become a target of Republicans in recent years, who call them irresponsible and part of a "woke" agenda. Proponents of the bill said fund managers should be focused on investment returns rather than be driven by factors they term political.
The Biden administration "wants to let Wall Street use workers' hard-earned savings to pursue left-wing political initiatives instead of trying to maximize the return for their clients' retirements," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).
Democrats, meanwhile, characterized the matter as a question of empowering Americans to make investment decisions.
"Workers should be able to invest their retirement savings in a way that reflects their values, such as combating climate change, without sacrificing investment returns," Rep. Bobby Scott (D., Va.), the top Democrat on the House Education and Workforce Committee, said on the House floor.
The bill faces uncertain odds in the Senate, where key moderate Democrats have yet to announce their positions on the legislation.
"Another one I got to take a look at," Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.), who is facing re-election this year, said Tuesday when asked about the Senate bill.

Full text: Forget whiz-bang technologies that are supposed to solve climate change. An ancient agricultural practice that removes carbon from the atmosphere is getting fresh attention and game-changing cash from big companies.
Biochar is a black substance similar to charcoal that when buried underground sequesters carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas that causes climate change. It has long been used to improve soil. Now it has suddenly become a lucrative business thanks to carbon credits that companies use to offset their own emissions. Among the buyers are JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Microsoft Corp. They are attracted to a process that actually removes carbon from the atmosphere and buries it underground, rather than many credits whose impact on emissions isn't clear.
Nearly all of the roughly 65,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide that have been removed from the atmosphere to date have been sequestered using biochar, according to estimates from data provider CDR.fyi.
There isn't much money to be made selling biochar to improve soil. Carbon credits changed that. "When the only potential revenue was through biochar sales, there just really wasn't much there," said Josiah Hunt, chief executive of Pacific Biochar Benefit Corp., a California startup that works with biomass power plants to produce biochar, then sells it to farmers.
Carbon-credit sales generate millions of dollars for some biochar businesses. Pacific Biochar struggled at first because the price was too high, roughly $600 a ton of biochar. That changed in late 2020 when the company started selling carbon credits for roughly $150 a ton of carbon dioxide removed to Microsoft and others. The extra revenue let Mr. Hunt cut prices and sales grew. Pacific Biochar's sales are expected to hit a few million dollars this year.
Companies are willing to pay many times more for removal credits like these than traditional offsets because there is more certainty they are removing carbon. Many offsets linked to projects such as keeping trees standing have been shown to have limited environmental benefits. The potential to remove large amounts of carbon and additional soil benefits make biochar credits attractive, said Brian DiMarino, JPMorgan's head of operational sustainability.
Biochar was used by farmers in South America thousands of years ago. They found that it helped soil retain water and nutrients. Most biochar is made using a process called pyrolysis that heats up organic matter while restricting levels of oxygen. Analysts estimate the U.S. currently produces roughly 100,000 tons of biochar a year, a fraction of what would be needed to make a dent against climate change. The U.S. emits about 6 billion tons of greenhouse gases a year.
One of the sector's biggest obstacles is making sure the carbon stays sequestered for hundreds or thousands of years. The length of time carbon stays sequestered through biochar can vary based on soil and microbial conditions. That uncertainty and some studies showing that the time could be shorter than expected have led to calls for the creation of an independent standards body to oversee the new market.
Governments and nonprofits are attempting to grow the nascent industry. The U.S. Agriculture Department recently said funding is available for farmers who apply biochar and meet certain conditions. The International Biochar Initiative is spreading the word to farmers and project developers in poor countries.
Tom and Tony Marrero, 50-year-old twin brothers, started Wakefield Biochar in 2014 with their father. Sales took off recently when the company signed contracts with big companies such as Koch Industries Inc.'s Georgia-Pacific LLC to dispose of their wood waste by turning it into biochar.
Wakefield Biochar has removed roughly 15,000 tons of carbon, the most in the industry,according to CDR.fyi, and generated a few million dollars in sales last year. Selling carbon credits to companies including JPMorgan and reinsurance firm Swiss Re AG has allowed the company to continue expanding its operations.
"All these things are happening partly because of our ability to be in the carbon market," said Tom Marrero, the company's president.

Full text: President Biden intends to nominate Ajay Banga, the former chief executive officer of Mastercard Inc., to serve as president of the World Bank, moving swiftly to fill a vacancy atop an institution the U.S. is pushing to overhaul.
As the largest shareholder in the World Bank, the U.S. typically selects the leader of the institution, a post that doesn't require Senate confirmation, though the bank's board will need to officially appoint Mr. Banga. The board of the World Bank said it would begin accepting nominees before interviewing a shortlist of candidates, with the aim of selecting a new leader by early May.
If chosen, Mr. Banga would succeed David Malpass, an appointee of former President Donald Trump who announced last week that he would step down from the role on June 30.
"Ajay is uniquely equipped to lead the World Bank at this critical moment in history," Mr. Biden said in a statement. "He has spent more than three decades building and managing successful, global companies that create jobs and bring investment to developing economies, and guiding organizations through periods of fundamental change."
The Biden administration, primarily through the Treasury Department, has sought to focus the World Bank's work more directly on addressing climate change. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the institution could stretch its balance sheet, better mobilize private capital to invest in the developing world and provide more financing directly to localities.
Ms. Yellen's focus on climate change came as Mr. Malpass faced criticism over his remarks on climate change. He said, "I am not a scientist," when asked if he believed that human activity contributed to global change.
Ms. Yellen has said the World Bank needs to broaden its mission from traditional infrastructure investments focused on poverty prevention and development. She has called on it to focus on long-term threats like climate change and pushed for development banks to expand their lending capacity.
Support for developing countries from Western countries and organizations like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund has in recent years been eclipsed by Chinese entities. China is now the largest bilateral creditor to many developing economies, alarming U.S. officials.
Raised in India, Mr. Banga oversaw a more than 13-fold increase in Mastercard's market capitalization while CEO. He joined General Atlantic, a private-equity firm, as vice chairman in 2021.
Mr. Banga has cultivated ties to top Democrats, serving on a cybersecurity commission in the Obama administration.
Following Mr. Malpass's decision to step down, the U.S. faced pressure from some advocacy groups and World Bank officials to choose a woman to succeed him. Since the World Bank was established in 1944, it has never been led by a woman.

Full text: MURCHISON FALLS NATIONAL PARK, Uganda -- A herd of elephants stomped through savannah grasslands to the throbbing sounds of bulldozers preparing oil wells that will soon start feeding a 900-mile pipeline from this wildlife and nature reserve.
The $10 billion project has become a flashpoint in the global battle against climate change, as some African governments with unexplored natural resources seek to resist a global push to limit investment in new fossil-fuel projects.
Opponents such as the U.S.-based Climate Accountability Institute, France's Friends of the Earth and the European Parliament say the pipeline, which needs to be heated to 122 degrees Fahrenheit to keep Uganda's waxy crude liquid, would produce 34.3 million tons in annual greenhouse-gas emissions, while the wells will pump oil the world can no longer use if it wants to limit global warming in line with international agreements.
But the governments of Uganda and Tanzania are arguing that they can't afford not to exploit their natural resources while the world still runs on fossil fuels. It is unfair, they say, to ask poor countries to safeguard global carbon sinks and nature reserves that rich Western countries, which are responsible for most historic emissions, destroyed long ago in pursuit of their own economic development.
"Nothing will stop this project," Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said from the garden of his official residence in Kampala. "We shall not accept any pressure from anybody. We know what we are doing."
TotalEnergies SE is building 10 well pads inside Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda's largest, where the Nile crashes through a narrow gap in the jungle and some of the world's largest remaining populations of giraffes, buffaloes and lions live.
Together with China's Cnooc Ltd. and the governments of Uganda and Tanzania, the French company also plans to construct a pipeline to transport the crude from those wells and others nearby to the East African coast and with it to global export markets.
"We have to stay on the lookout for any threats from animals," said Sam Mugwere, one of three park rangers armed with AK-47 rifles and stationed around the construction site. "Sometimes we shoot in the air to scare away charging elephants."
Fitch Solutions estimates that Uganda could earn as much as $2 billion a year in taxes and royalties from the 230,000 barrels-a-day fields and the pipeline, a significant bump to the $4.5 billion it currently collects in domestic taxes.
The increase in oil-and-gas prices during the past year has boosted other African governments' interest in developing new fossil-fuel projects -- and has triggered international pushback. Uganda's neighbor, the Democratic Republic of Congo, has faced criticism, including from the Biden administration, over its plans to auction off oil-and-gas drilling sites inside its famed Virunga National Park, home to some of the world's last remaining mountain gorillas, and peatland and rainforest areas that absorb carbon.
Farther south, the government of Namibia is under pressure from the United Nations to put a stop to exploratory oil drilling in the Okavango Delta, a Unesco World Heritage site.
In the case of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, more than a dozen international banks and insurers -- including HSBC, Barclays and major French lenders that have helped finance previous TotalEnergies projects -- publicly have said they won't support it. Friends of the Earth said that in addition to contributing to greenhouse-gas emissions, the project endangers local ecosystems and wildlife habitats, and is displacing vulnerable populations from their homes and livelihoods.
TotalEnergies says it is confident it can raise the financing necessary to build the pipeline, with South Africa's Standard Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Bank acting as lead arrangers for the project loans. People familiar with the project say the participating banks are asking for higher interest rates, which has helped raise the cost of the pipeline to $5 billion from $3.5 billion.
Despite this and other recent investments, money flowing into energy projects in Africa remains about half of what it was a decade ago.
Some officials in poorer countries say such restrictions exacerbate global inequities, by allowing countries that have the necessary infrastructure to profit from their fossil-fuel reserves, while potential newcomers are locked out.
"The energy transition shouldn't be looked at globally where we are all lumped together," said Irene Batebe, permanent secretary at Uganda's energy and minerals ministry. "When you look at our pollution levels, you cannot say Uganda has overpolluted."

Full text: Bellevue, Wash. -- Sometimes it takes a visionary to throw cold water on a seemingly revolutionary development. When scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieved a breakthrough in December -- producing more energy in a fusion reaction than they used to ignite it -- the Biden administration hyped the experiment as a quantum leap for its green agenda. "This milestone," Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm boasted, "moves us one significant step closer to the possibility of zero-carbon abundant fusion energy powering our society."
Not so fast, says Nathan Myhrvold, one of America's most versatile applied scientists and inventors. "While I hope to see affordable fusion reactors in my lifetime," he says, "I'm not holding my breath." (He's 63.) The machine at the National Ignition Facility was designed to make "at most a few bright flashes of raw energy a day. That's it. Not to capture the energy, not to turn it into electricity." He says it's "sort of like those spectacular gasoline explosions you see in the movies when they blow up a car." It's a "long, long road" from there to an internal-combustion engine that "converts thousands of controlled gasoline explosions into useful energy every second."
Make no mistake -- Mr. Myhrvold is concerned about climate change. But he's a scientific realist who thinks the shibboleths on the subject -- embodied in such documents as the Paris Agreement of 2016 -- are misbegotten. Mankind isn't capable of reducing emissions enough to keep temperatures from rising unacceptably.
He laments that policy makers largely scorn geoengineering -- human interventions in the Earth's natural systems to thwart or neutralize climate change. Such interventions could make a difference by following two broad approaches: solar-radiation management, "which seeks to reflect sunlight back into space," and direct air capture, which means "sucking carbon-dioxide from the sky." While these methods may "sound crazy," he says, "they could work." But research of this kind is actively discouraged.
The case for geoengineering begins with the argument that the alternative is insufficient. Data from rigorous long-term CO2 measurements around the world show that "despite all the coal plants shut down, all the electric vehicles sold, all the solar and wind power deployed, all the people now working from home rather than commuting," the concentration of CO2 continues to rise "just about as fast as it has for the past 40 years, and faster than it did in the 1960s and '70s." He underscores the point with a rhetorical question: "Do you see the effect on emissions of the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, or of the global pandemic shutdown? Nor do I."
"If the projections are true, and I think they are, I think we're already screwed," he says. If we stop "all human-done" CO2 emissions today, climate models suggest the Earth's climate would continue to get warmer. "It would keep going up for almost 100 years. It would take 145 years before it eventually went down to the same temperature it is today. That's just the physics of the problem."
Geoengineering is about "deliberately trying to reduce climate change." Excess CO2 traps a little less than 1% of heat from the sun, "so if we could make the sun 1% dimmer, we could shut off climate change." When Mount Pinatubo, a volcano in the Philippines, erupted in 1991, it lowered world-wide temperatures by 1 degree Celsius for about 18 months. Human-emitted particulate pollution has historically offset about 20% of human-emitted CO2. "Ironically," he says, "the Clean Air Act made our air better but hurt climate change."
The simplest solar-radiation management scheme, Mr. Myhrvold says, "is to emit particles in the stratosphere to mimic Mount Pinatubo. We invented a particularly elegant way to do this with balloons and a pipe to the sky." By "we," he means Intellectual Ventures, the company Mr. Myhrvold founded in 2000 after leaving Microsoft, where he spent 13 years and rose to the position of chief technology officer. Intellectual Ventures "creates, incubates and commercializes" new inventions.
"Marine cloud brightening" is another solar-related intervention. "The idea is to increase the number and size of low clouds that form over the oceans so that more incoming sunlight bounces back into space instead of heating the ocean." Scientists have proposed a variety of ways to do this. One, which Mr. Myhrvold's company has explored, is to outfit ships with equipment to spray seawater into the air as they traverse the ocean. "The salt particles can serve as nuclei for water vapor to condense into droplets, thus forming clouds."
Intellectual Ventures has also researched an idea for draining energy from hurricanes -- "not a climate intervention per se, but a way to deal with the more intense cyclonic storms that some models project are likely to occur in a warmer world." Low-cost floating tubes would harness wave action to increase the mixing of the ocean's warm top layer -- the source of heat that powers hurricanes -- with cooler deep water. "Our simulations found that if enough of these were deployed in the path of the hurricane," he says, "it could knock a storm down by a category or two." But it would take thousands of tubes, so would be a challenge to deploy. "The real stumper was not technological but practical. Who would pay for the system and manage it?"
Direct air capture, the other major form of geo-intervention, may prove harder to do than solar-energy capture. Mr. Myhrvold says there are "three big issues" with extracting CO2 from the sky. The first is that CO2 is only 400 parts per million, or 0.04%, of the air. "So you need to work hard to get it -- i.e., move a lot of air." The second: CO2 dissolves in seawater. About half of human-emitted CO2 is in the ocean, and it is in equilibrium with the atmosphere. "If we withdraw CO2 from the air, the system re-equilibrates. So if we pull two units out of the air, we remove one unit net, because one unit comes out of the ocean." The third issue is where to put the CO2: "It is very hard to store that much gas. If you reduce it to solid carbon, it would be immense."
Mr. Myhrvold has met with several "very enthusiastic, very brilliant" entrepreneurs who have technologies either to remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or to make Earth a lot less hot. He recently spent time with a startup that has "a clever idea" for direct air capture. "At one point in the meeting I asked a question that I ask everyone in geoengineering: 'You're acting as if the world wants to solve the problem of climate change. Why is that?'" He explains his cynicism: "There are activists who oppose funding or experiments. There's no evidence I can see that many of the people involved in the climate debate want a solution."
The enthusiastic reaction to the experiment at Livermore Lab reinforces that point. Compared with that fusion reaction, Mr. Myhrvold sees far more promise in conventional nuclear power, or fission. "But there is a crazy notion of only liking some flavors of carbon-free power. Renewables are OK, but nuclear is not."
Mr. Myhrvold's scientific interests range beyond geoengineering to include computing, paleontology, astronomy and "cutting-edge" cooking. He is a co-author of "Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking" (2011), a five-volume cookbook that explains the science of food preparation and the latest kitchen technologies.
Prodigies, it is said, retain a childlike character into older age, and Mr. Myhrvold is no different. He went to college at 14, graduating from UCLA four years later with both a bachelor's degree in math and a master's in geophysics and space physics. Words tumble out at a boyish pace when he speaks, especially when excited. He's easily distracted, as evident when a staffer brings in a slice of corn bread baked on the premises in a vast kitchen used for food experiments. "This is made with 100% maltitol," he says as he cuts himself a bite. Maltitol is a sugar alcohol -- sweet but edible by diabetics.
Mr. Myhrvold has four degrees -- after UCLA, he went on to earn a master's in mathematical economics and a doctorate in applied math from Princeton. He plays these down, joking that his friends used to say he was "trying to have more degrees than a thermometer." But he lights up when he says he has a Grand Diplome from the Ecole de Cuisine La Varenne, a culinary school. He's particularly proud of his 1979 fellowship from the Hertz Foundation, which gives out a handful of cash awards annually to promising young applied scientists. In December the foundation endowed a new fellowship in Mr. Myhrvold's honor.
Geoengineering would appear to be the application of science par excellence. But along with the activists who "don't want a technical solution to climate change," he says, "there's a second set of people who may not have that ideology, but have a more realpolitik sort of view." This group -- which comprises most Western governments -- want "people to shut up" about interventions. He likens this approach to "The Little Engine That Could," a children's story about a small blue engine that pulled an entire train over a hill, inch by inch, through the sheer force of its will. "Opponents worry that once you have geoengineering, people won't make sacrifices to cut emissions. They want a sword of Damocles hanging over humanity as a means to force us to follow their ideology."
Mr. Myhrvold uses an analogy he describes as "horrible in some ways." When the AIDS epidemic hit, some people saw it as punishment from God. "Their attitude was, 'This is what you get if you indulge in the practices we don't approve of.'" In climate change, he says, this moralistic attitude takes the following form: "I don't like aspects of our society, I don't like technology, I don't like capitalism, and this is nature's retribution. And so we have to change the way we live." Such beliefs "have become a very powerful disincentive, particularly for academic researchers."
Things may have to get worse before they can get better. He believes the opposition will have to cease as the world experiences "very severe climate consequences" and demand rises for "an intervention to fix the problem." He calls it "insane" not to fund such research and invokes another analogy: heart surgery and stents.
"You could imagine a world in which cardiology doesn't exist because the medical profession said, 'You fat bastards. You did it to yourselves. We're not going to help you.'"

Full text: Some of the world's biggest companies are fighting over what qualifies as green energy. At stake are tax credits worth billions of dollars under the new U.S. climate law for one of the most-hyped clean-energy technologies.
Industry leaders such as BP PLC and NextEra Energy Inc. are arguing against renewable-energy companies including Vestas Wind Systems AS and Intersect Power LLC over tax credits for hydrogen, a fuel that when made from renewable energy could reduce carbon emissions from transportation and other industrial sectors by replacing oil and gas.
The battle is about what types of hydrogen should be classified as "clean" and receive tax credits. The incentives are seen as vital to making clean hydrogen cost competitive with hydrogen made from natural gas, which can be several times cheaper but emits carbon in the production process.
Businesses large and small are repositioning themselves to try to capture some of the tidal wave of government cash from the new law dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law last year. The rules defining eligibility for hydrogen tax credits, now being written by the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department, are some of the most contentious because they could affect project investment decisions and the development of a new industry.
"The decisions the IRS and Treasury make on this will absolutely shift billions of dollars moving forward," said Danny Cullenward, policy director at CarbonPlan, a nonprofit that analyzes climate solutions. "The big risk is throwing out massive subsidies that don't do anything." His main concern is loose criteria that spark interest in the tax credits or increase emissions without boosting the core technology to make hydrogen.
The Treasury Department is working to finalize its rules and standards to implement the law in the coming months.
A spokeswoman said the agency is working with stakeholders and partners including the Energy Department to make sure the hydrogen rules help energy security and fight climate change.
Most proposed clean hydrogen projects use machines called electrolyzers that split water into hydrogen and oxygen. When electrolyzers run on electricity produced from renewable sources, that hydrogen is considered clean or green.
The issue is that electrolyzers currently consume huge amounts of energy to make a small amount of hydrogen. Many energy companies and upstarts such as Plug Power Inc. have proposed making hydrogen using power drawn from the electricity grid -- some of which is generated using fossil fuels -- and buying renewable-energy certificates, or RECs, tied to green-power projects elsewhere to still qualify that hydrogen as clean.
Clean-energy firms such as Vestas and Intersect, as well as environmentalists, have argued in recent comments to the IRS that those companies should have to effectively prove they are using green power by matching their hydrogen plant's electricity consumption to renewable-power generation on an hourly basis and making sure the green project is located in the same region.
Not doing so means that some hydrogen plants tied to the electricity grid wouldn't in fact be green, some companies argue, and could at times be more carbon-intensive than conventional hydrogen made from natural gas, given that some regions remain reliant on coal to generate electricity.
"There's a lot of self-serving behavior being driven by the availability of a really juicy subsidy," Raffi Garabedian, chief executive of Electric Hydrogen, said in an interview.
Mr. Garabedian's firm is backed by Amazon.com Inc., Honeywell International Inc. and Rio Tinto PLC and works to make more efficient electrolyzers to lower the cost of green hydrogen.
Electric Hydrogen has pushed for the tighter rules alongside renewable-energy firms such as Vestas and Intersect. Mr. Garabedian is the former chief technology officer of solar panel maker First Solar Inc.
The tighter rules might mean proposed hydrogen facilities would have to shut down for parts of the day when the wind isn't blowing or sun isn't shining, potentially making such projects less viable.
NextEra, the owner of Florida Power & Light and one of the world's biggest renewable energy developers, as well as energy stalwarts including BP and Shell PLC, are pushing for a much looser time period such as monthly or annual matching. They say such concessions are needed to kick-start the industry until technology improves and costs come down.
Rebecca Kujawa, chief executive of NextEra Energy Resources, the company's renewable-development unit, said an hourly matching requirement would make clean hydrogen substantially more expensive to produce and constrain the number of customers willing to buy it.
"If you end up having an uneconomic green hydrogen product relative to alternatives, there will be no market adoption," she said. "It's truly an industry that is either waiting to get off the ground or will be dead on arrival, depending on what the Treasury ultimately determines."
The cheapest hydrogen made from natural gas costs about $1.50 per kilogram to produce, while green hydrogen costs roughly $5 or more. The proposed tax credit is up to $3 per kilogram, depending on the carbon emissions associated with the hydrogen production.
NextEra last summer said it plans to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to near zero by 2045 without using carbon offsets or RECs that some other businesses use to neutralize their environmental footprints. The company is planning to build large solar projects and run power plants on hydrogen.
Ms. Kujawa said the company sees a path to producing hydrogen for power generation without using RECs but that they are needed in the near term to develop a market for industrial customers looking to use hydrogen for other means.
Some of the renewable-energy firms arguing for the tighter standards could benefit from them because they have planned projects that would be connected to on-site green energy without using the grid.
Some analysts and industry executives such as Sheldon Kimber, Intersect Power's CEO, said a phased approach that tightens the restrictions over time could be a realistic compromise.

Full text: LONDON -- An advocacy group sued the directors of Shell PLC, challenging the oil giant over what it says are failures to act on the climate crisis.
ClientEarth, a group of environmental lawyers that holds a small shareholding in Shell, said it has filed a lawsuit against the board. The organization said the claim marks the first time corporate directors could potentially be held personally liable over a company's action on fossil fuels.
The group, which said it has the backing of institutional investors that together hold more than 12 million shares of Shell, says the company has failed to put sufficient emissions-reduction targets in place.
"Shell is seriously exposed to the risks of climate change, yet its climate plan is fundamentally flawed," said Paul Benson, a senior lawyer at ClientEarth.
"In failing to properly prepare the company for the net-zero transition, Shell's Board is increasing the company's vulnerability to climate risk, putting its long-term value in jeopardy."
Shell dismissed the claims and said it had a robust energy transition strategy in place.
"We believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels," a spokesperson for the company said.
"Our shareholders strongly support the progress we are making on our energy transition strategy, with 80% voting in favor of this strategy at our last [annual general meeting]." Shell's directors had acted in the best interests of the company, the company spokesperson added.
Last week, Shell posted a record annual profit for last year, joining American peers in surging back from early pandemic losses on soaring energy prices.
Shell's $41.6 billion full-year profit surpassed the London-based company's previous record of $31.4 billion in 2008, measured on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis -- a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report.
European major oil companies like Shell and London-based rival BP PLC face greater scrutiny over their carbon-reduction plans than do U.S. rivals, which have stuck more to their core oil-and-gas businesses.
But the sector globally is wedged between some large investors and governments calling for accelerated shifts away from fossil fuels and others continuing to demand the profits that those assets can generate.
BP this week said it planned to slow its transition away from fossil fuels, dialing back elements of its renewable-energy push in part to focus more on its legacy oil-and-gas operations.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Representatives of Europe's two top economies proposed new efforts with the U.S. to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals used in electric vehicles and other green technology products, even as they continued to press the U.S. about its clean energy legislation.
Robert Habeck, German vice chancellor and minister for economic affairs and climate action, proposed Tuesday creating a "critical minerals club" with the U.S. during a trip to Washington where he met with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, among others. Bruno Le Maire, French minister for finance, economy and industry, also attended the meetings.
The two ministers were the latest European officials to meet their U.S. counterparts to press for the inclusion of European businesses in programs stemming from the U.S.'s Inflation Reduction Act, which allocates $369 billion on energy security and climate change programs over the next 10 years.
European officials have said the IRA's provision to require local assembly and parts and minerals contents to qualify for electric vehicle tax credits discriminates against European companies.
Mr. Habeck said at a news conference that the goal of a critical minerals club is to find concrete measures to diversify supplies of critical minerals and reduce reliance on a small number of suppliers including China. The club, he said, could also lead to further alignments between the EU and the U.S. on clean energy products, which could resolve the current bilateral tension over the IRA, which he said is threatening to cause a "race to subsidies."
Mr. Le Maire said the primary goal of their visit was to discuss with the U.S. ways to better cooperate on policies for green and sustainable industry. "We should have the same strategic objectives in the two continents . . . by creating new supply chains for hydrogen, chips, solar panels, batteries, EVs and so on," he said.
The European officials, Mr. Le Maire said, made substantive progress in their discussions with their U.S. counterparts Tuesday. The two sides, he said, agreed on the necessity of full transparency on the level of subsidies and tax credits and the inclusion of as many EU companies as possible in the IRA-linked projects, he said.
While U.S. officials didn't comment on the ministers' statements, Ms. Raimondo stressed that the IRA is "a key tool and is the most significant U.S. climate legislation to date," according to a readout of their meeting.
She also commented on the strong U.S.-EU collaboration and progress made on semiconductor supply chains through the bilateral Trade and Technology Council.
The IRA's provision for electric-vehicle tax credit includes a requirement that a certain amount of critical minerals in the vehicle's battery come from countries that have a free-trade agreement with the U.S., a rule that irked the EU because it doesn't have an FTA. U.S. officials have discussed negotiating a narrow critical-minerals agreement with the EU that would allow the bloc to qualify for the critical-minerals provision, according to people familiar with the matter.
The European Union's executive body last week set out a roadmap for competing with American green subsidies.

Full text: The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a softening of planned rules requiring companies to disclose the effects of extreme weather and other costs related to global warming when the regulator completes its climate-change proposals, people close to the agency said.
The Wall Street regulator is looking again at the financial reporting aspect of the climate-disclosure plan it issued last year, following pushback from investors, companies and lawmakers, the people said.
The final version of the SEC rules, expected this year, will likely still mandate some climate disclosures in financial statements, according to the people close to the agency. But the commission is weighing making the requirements less onerous than originally proposed, the people said, such as by raising the threshold at which companies must report climate costs.
Besides the financial-reporting rules, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's climate proposals would require public companies to disclose greenhouse-gas emissions from their operations, energy consumption and -- in some cases -- suppliers and customers.
The climate package is expected to face legal challenges from industry groups or Republicans. Dialing back the financial-reporting rules could bolster the agency's legal defense by allowing it to demonstrate that it has listened to business concerns and reduced the forecast multibillion-dollar annual cost of the new system. Evan Williams, senior director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, said the SEC needs to adjust the proposal if it wants to produce "a court-durable final rule."
The proposed reporting rules would require public companies to include a raft of climate data in their audited financial statements. The mandated disclosures cover everything from costs caused by wildfires to the loss of a sales contract because of climate regulations, such as a cap on carbon emissions.
Companies would have to analyze climate-related costs and risks for each line item of their financial statements, such as revenue, inventories or intangible assets. Any climate costs that are 1% or more of each line item total would have to be reported.
Under current rules, companies are generally required to disclose only those climate costs and risks they judge to be material, or significant, for investors.

Full text: BOGOTA, Colombia -- With global demand for oil surging and many countries trying to increase production, Colombia is rolling back its petroleum industry.
The country's new president, Gustavo Petro, says oil is poisoning the earth and warns that climate change could lead to the extinction of the human race. His government has suspended fracking operations, and he says there is no need for new oil exploration.
"The only way to halt the climate crisis is through zero consumption of carbon and petroleum," Mr. Petro, a former leftist guerrilla turned politician, said this month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He has said that in about 15 years Colombia will transition to renewable energy from fossil fuels.
Oil-industry analysts and economists, however, say Mr. Petro's leftist government has failed to explain how it will wean Colombia off oil -- which makes up about one-third of the nation's export earnings -- and provide the energy needed for this developing country to grow. They predict that by moving too fast, his policies will make the country poorer.
Colombia is Latin America's third-largest oil producer, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says, pumping about 749,000 barrels a day -- but production has been falling since 2013. And even though energy companies are searching for oil here under 118 contracts signed by previous governments, the country could run out within a decade if it rejects new exploration deals, said Francisco Lloreda, president of the Colombian Oil Association, an industry group.
That would be long before Colombia -- where electric vehicles, solar parks and wind farms are few and far between -- could switch to renewables.
"The world will need oil for decades, and we need oil income," Mr. Lloreda said. "But for some reason, this government appears to want to shoot itself in the head."
The mines and energy minister, Irene Velez, said in an interview that as nations switch to renewables, demand for oil will soon plummet and major new investments in petroleum would only saddle Colombia with stranded assets. She said current exploration projects will provide the crude for Colombia as it transitions to clean energy.
A university professor and environmental activist, Ms. Velez blames climate change for three straight years of La Nina, a trade-wind pattern that causes severe weather that has pounded Colombia with torrential rains. Landslides and flooding killed 271 people in the 12 months that ended in November last year.
"We are trying to protect human lives and Mother Nature, which is our moral commitment," she said.
Colombia's position is in line with a 2021 report by the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental panel calling for a ban on investments in new fossil-fuel projects. At the Davos summit, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said expanding oil production would be "insanity."
Yet no other significant oil producer is following the Petro government's lead, including the U.S., Russia, and other nations that dwarf Colombia in greenhouse-gas emissions.

Full text: Countries and businesses aren't doing enough to put the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, Pakistan's minister of climate change and the chief executives of Heineken and Baker Hughes said Tuesday.
More policies such as the new U.S. climate, health and spending legislation known as the Inflation Reduction Act are needed globally to implement clean-energy technologies and increase incentives to invest, they said at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
"We feel that a global reset is needed," said Sherry Rehman, minister of climate change for Pakistan, which was devastated by flooding last year and is expected to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.
The comments came hours after U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said the U.S. won't compromise on its 1.5-degree warming goal. Scientific models show the world is on track to be well above 1.5 degrees warmer than preindustrial levels by midcentury and miss the goals of the 2015 Paris accord.
The target of 1.5 degrees Celsius -- or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit -- has been the north star of United Nations climate negotiations since it was enshrined in the 2015 Paris accord. The Earth has warmed by around 1.1 degrees since 1850, according to a recent U.N. climate-science report. That is largely due to an increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, caused by industrialization, scientists say.
Successive climate summits have failed to get governments to commit to enough of the emissions cuts that scientists believe are necessary to limit warming to the 1.5-degree ambition. Mr. Kerry said the goal was still realistic, and the U.S. was committed to getting there.
"1.5 is 1.5," he said on the sidelines of the talks. "We're adamant about that. We feel very strongly that any talk of 1.5 not being appropriate at this point is talk being sponsored by some folks who would love to not have to stretch and not have to work as hard" to get emissions down further," he said.
Ms. Rehman, Heineken Chief Executive Dolf van den Brink and Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli called for more global coordination among regulators to encourage power purchase agreements and tax credits that can spur the deployment of renewables.
They said companies and countries should do as much as they can with existing technologies until more-advanced solutions are available at scale.
Mr. van den Brink said each of Heineken's roughly 200 breweries across some 70 countries have had to develop and implement their own plans to reduce emissions as much as possible and mitigate any unavoidable emissions.

Full text: Greta Thunberg, the climate activist, was carried away and detained by police Tuesday in a German village where demonstrators have been opposing expanding a coal mine, a spokeswoman for the group organizing the protest said.
Ms. Thunberg, 20 years old, joined dozens of demonstrators in the village of Lutzerath, about 75 miles west of Frankfurt, since the weekend, said Charly Dietz, a spokeswoman for Ende Gelande, an alliance of climate-action groups that organized the protest. Ms. Thunberg and other demonstrators had been blocking the front of a coal mine and refused to leave after police asked them to, she said.
Ms. Dietz said this is the second time Ms. Thunberg had been removed from the protests in Lutzerath.
The Germany energy company RWE AG has been planning to demolish the village to expand a coal mine in the area.
Representatives for RWE, Ms. Thunberg and the local police didn't return requests to comment Tuesday.
RWE said last week that it planned to start demolishing Lutzerath. The company said it had secured the necessary licenses and court orders to make room for a coal mine. No one has lived in the small village since 2017, although some squatters have occupied buildings.
"RWE is appealing to potential protesters not to trespass on company sites, not to participate in unlawful acts, and to remain calm during the protest campaign," the company said last week.
Ms. Thunberg is among the world's most prolific climate activists and has led climate protests chastising leaders for what she has said is a lack of climate action. She first drew international attention when she began cutting her ninth-grade classes in 2018 to sit outside the Swedish Parliament building. She carried a purple backpack and a sign saying she was on strike because of climate change.
Ms. Thunberg's appearance at the protest could help draw attention to the planned coal mine in Lutzerath. Ms. Dietz said no one from the Ende Gelande had asked Ms. Thunberg to go to the protests. She appeared at the demonstration with a cardboard sign that said, "Keep It In The Ground."

Full text: KINGSLAND, Ga -- Andy Marsh tried for 14 years to make a profit running Plug Power Inc. Last summer he went to Washington and came away with a potential windfall.
While senators battled over the climate, tax and spending bill, there was surprising agreement that hydrogen, Plug Power's business, needed a big dose of support. "My biggest concern that I have right now is that we have not invested the money that we needed to invest in hydrogen," Sen. Joe Manchin, (D., W.Va.) said at a hearing in July when he was blocking the overall package.
Mr. Marsh takes some credit. He shuttled back and forth to Washington, made a trip to West Virginia and agreed to build plants in New York at the urging of Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., NY). All appeared for naught when Mr. Manchin rejected plan after plan.
When the two senators surprised Washington with a deal, Mr. Marsh got what he asked for. "It's been a pretty harrowing ride," he said.
At Plug Power's first green hydrogen facility in a southeast Georgia industrial park in Kingsland, construction workers lay pipe and concrete where the company soon expects to produce about 15,000 kilograms of liquid hydrogen a day. That is enough to power roughly 10,000 forklifts or about 300 trucks for a day.
Hydrogen has long been a dream of clean-energy advocates. It can produce energy with water as the only byproduct. Climate change has made it a favorite of oil companies, steelmakers, airlines and other industries under pressure to reduce carbon emissions.
China, Japan, Australia and Europe have a head start on the U.S. But Congress packed the new law, the Inflation Reduction Act, with goodies meant to urge American production of renewable energy and its technology. Few companies have more to gain than Plug Power from the government cash, which turns an expensive and money-losing fuel source to a potentially profitable one.
If Plug Power succeeds, it would be a dramatic transformation for the supplier of power equipment for forklifts, which hasn't turned a profit in its 25-year history. Plug Power stock has twice soared to bubble levels -- 20 years apart -- and crashed. Mr. Marsh is being sued by investors for cashing in on the last boom. Today Plug Power's shares are off about 80% from the most recent bubble peak.
The government's push into hydrogen and Plug Power's decades of experience with fuel cells have transformed the company into a potential leader in a hot new industry.
"They've got a one-lap lead in a very, very competitive race," said Wesley Edens, the billionaire co-chief executive of Fortress Investment Group LLC and chief executive of liquefied natural-gas company New Fortress Energy. New Fortress plans to use Plug Power equipment to make green hydrogen in a Texas facility.
The global hydrogen market is projected to more than triple by 2050, with green hydrogen accounting for nearly all of that growth, consulting firm Wood Mackenzie forecasts. It would become one of the biggest industries in the energy sector.
Right now, the cheapest hydrogen, which is made from natural gas, costs about $1.50 a kilogram to produce. Green hydrogen costs roughly $5 a kilogram or more.
Plug Power plans to sell green hydrogen to customers like Amazon and Walmart for about $6 a kilogram. The new tax credit of up to $3 a kilogram, which will be shared with the customers, will make the product more than twice as profitable. Shortly after the bill signing, Plug Power announced another agreement with Amazon to supply roughly 10 million kilograms annually starting in 2025.
At the Georgia facility, devices called electrolyzers will split water into hydrogen and oxygen, then the hydrogen will be cooled and compressed.
The plant will initially run on power from the local utility, some of which is generated from fossil fuels, so Plug will pay for renewable energy certificates to qualify the hydrogen as green.
It is planning facilities in New York, California and Texas, plus an expansion of the Georgia facility. It is also adding to its fuel-cell production. Mr. Schumer cut the ribbon at a Plug Power fuel-cell manufacturing facility in New York on Thursday.
Big hydrogen producers Linde PLC and Air Products and Chemicals Inc. have also ramped up their U.S. green hydrogen commitments. Air Products' $4 billion project in Texas will be one of the largest globally when it begins operating in 2027. Oil-and-gas giants are also investing in the sector.

Oil Chief Will Run
Climate Summit
The United Arab Emirates named the chief executive of its national oil company as the president of this year's United Nations climate summit, drawing criticism from environmental activists.
The Gulf state said Thursday that Sultan al-Jaber, chief executive of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc, would frame the COP28 agenda in Dubai, which opens in late November. Mr. Jaber, a top Emirati technocrat, also is the nations's minister for industry and technology and special envoy on climate change, playing a leading role in the country's move to finance and produce more renewable and nuclear energy.
Climate activists called on Mr. Jaber to relinquish his role as Adnoc CEO, saying it represents a conflict of interest with his position as COP28 president-designate.
A spokesperson for COP28 U.A.E. said Mr. Jaber has worked as a diplomat, government minister and business leader in the energy and renewables sector.

EGYPT
Government Plans
To Reduce Spending
Egypt plans to cut spending after the International Monetary Fund extended hundreds of millions of dollars in an economic-bailout package, as the country struggles to pay off debts accumulated from a decadeslong building boom.
Authorities said this week they would delay state projects that required significant U.S. dollars to fund and cut back on travel, training and conferences for officials, Egypt's cabinet said.
The announcement came after the government agreed to measures as part of an IMF package, including selling billions of dollars of state assets to international investors, taking steps to reduce the role of the state and military-owned companies in favor of private businesses in the economy, and shifting to a more flexible currency-exchange system, the international creditor said this week.
The IMF said Egypt agreed to reduce its financing needs and cut back on debt, but didn't lay out specific areas for cuts.
Egypt is set to receive nearly $3 billion in loans from the IMF over four years, after the pandemic hit tourism and the war in Ukraine pushed up commodity prices, tipping the country into an economic crisis. As investors soured on the economy and pulled out of Egyptian assets, the Egyptian pound plummeted against the U.S. dollar, leaving the country struggling to pay for imports.
As a result, annual inflation hit 21.3% in December, a five-year high according to the government.

SWEDEN
Rare-Earth Find Lifts
Hope for Energy Shift
The discovery in Kiruna of a large deposit of rare-earth elements, vital for renewable energy and electric vehicles, offers fresh hopes for Europe's transition away from fossil fuels and less reliance on China, the world's top supplier of the critical minerals.
Announcing potentially the largest known find in Europe, Swedish state-owned mining company LKAB on Thursday said some of the rare-earth elements in the deposit could be used to produce permanent magnets, which are components in motors for electric vehicles and wind turbines. The firm said the rare-earth elements could be produced as a byproduct of mining iron ore.
The deposit "could become a significant building block for producing the critical raw materials that are absolutely crucial to enable the green transition," LKAB Chief Executive Jan Mostrom said.
The European Commission plans to propose legislation on critical raw materials this year, which aims to boost the EU's provisions of the vital industrial supplies. Sweden, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, said it plans to give priority to the critical-minerals legislation during its six-month term.
Based on current timelines for obtaining permits, it could take 10 to 15 years or more before mining of the new deposit begins, the company said.
The newly discovered deposit holds about one million metric tons of rare-earth oxides, LKAB said. Rare-earth elements are extracted from rare-earth oxides.

Full text: One of the most important technologies to address climate change got a boost Thursday when a startup said it pulled carbon dioxide from the open air and stored it underground. The company has cashed in on the effort, potentially creating a viable business model that could kick-start a new industry.
Climeworks AG is a leader in the race to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, using a process known as direct-air capture. Customers, including Microsoft Corp., paid a significant premium to buy carbon credits generated by Climeworks, allowing them to effectively offset their own emissions.
Climeworks and others have long promised that using vacuum-like devices to pull in air, filter it and bury carbon underground can help mitigate environmental damage caused by human activities. This is the first time a company has actually done it at a meaningful scale using a third-party verified process.
"We hope we are growing from a teenager to a grown-up in this industry," Christoph Gebald, co-chief executive of Climeworks, said in an interview.
Founded in 2009, Climeworks is effectively carrying out what trees do by taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The process promises to store the carbon in the earth for thousands of years. The company makes money by removing the carbon on behalf of businesses that can claim they are becoming carbon neutral.
Microsoft, e-commerce company Shopify Inc. and payments firm Stripe Inc. have prepaid or agreed to pay hundreds of dollars per credit, each of which represents one metric ton of carbon removed. Other carbon credits tied to projects such as keeping trees standing have often been criticized because the projects often don't reduce emissions as much as promised.
Companies pay a premium, sometimes 100 times as much as basic credits, for the credits from Climeworks because there is more certainty they remove carbon from the atmosphere. The companies also are willing to pay more to help jump-start the industry, hoping that costs decline rapidly.
"This is an important inflection point in the development of direct-air capture," said Stacy Kauk, Shopify's head of sustainability. "It isn't just science fiction. It's reality."
The promise of the technology has prompted established businesses such as Occidental Petroleum Corp. to develop their own direct-air capture strategies.
Climeworks operates one of the world's only operational direct-air capture plants in Iceland, which is capable of removing about 4,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of about 800 passenger cars. Other removals to this point had been done using methods such as burying carbon-rich plant material underground.
Climeworks declined to say how much carbon it removed. Businesses globally have agreed to purchase credits equivalent to more than 700,000 metric tons of carbon removal from it and other companies, according to data provider CDR.fyi. Scientists estimate billions of metric tons a year need to be removed annually by midcentury to avoid the worst effects of global warming.
Bigger companies and investors are flocking to the industry. Occidental recently said it aims to increase the number of planned direct-air-capture facilities it operates to 100 from 70 by 2035, aided by bolstered tax credits that are part of the climate, health and spending legislation known as the Inflation Reduction Act.
The tax credits are now up to $180 per metric ton of removal. Occidental is working with a startup on its first large facility in the Texas Permian Basin. Airbus SE has committed to buy several hundred thousand credits of removal tied to the project.
Climeworks raised about $650 million in equity from investors including Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. and private-equity firm Partners Group Holding AG early last year. It also has raised debt from Microsoft's $1 billion climate-innovation fund.
The company is building a second facility in Iceland that will be capable of removing about 36,000 metric tons a year.
It is eyeing U.S. expansion with the government doling out about $3.5 billion through the 2021 infrastructure bill to develop four regional direct-air capture hubs. The European Union also is taking steps to grow the sector.
"The support that governments have provided is a game changer," said Zeke Hausfather, Stripe's climate-research lead.
Skeptics question using huge amounts of energy and resources to build massive machines in the name of fighting climate change. Climeworks' Iceland facility runs on renewable geothermal energy -- meaning its associated emissions are minimal -- and a different startup pumps the carbon underground after dissolving it in vast amounts of water.
Industry executives say that direct-air capture is one of the few solutions for large-scale carbon removal that can mitigate unavoidable emissions and that costs will come down as the industry matures.

Full text: The U.S. experienced an average hurricane season, and though among the warmer years on record, 2022 didn't break temperature records for the country as a whole, federal climate scientists said Tuesday. But a series of big disasters, including the deadly Hurricane Ian, pushed damage costs from extreme weather events to about $165 billion.
In its annual national climate assessment, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration listed drought in the western U.S., early and swift-moving wildfires in Alaska, and Hurricane Ian's extensive destruction among the record-setting events of last year.
"In the U.S., we have consistently had both the highest total count, more than any other country each year, and the largest diversity of different types of weather and climate extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters," said Richard Spinrad, NOAA administrator, at a press conference Tuesday.
Making landfall in Florida on Sept. 28 as a Category 4 hurricane, Ian caused damages of an estimated $112.9 billion. According to NOAA, only two other major storms, Hurricanes Harvey in 2017 and Katrina in 2005, resulted in more costly harm.
Over the year, 18 disasters -- including floods in Missouri and Kentucky, tornadoes ripping through the South, and a powerful wind storm, or derecho, whose gusty path across the Midwest downed power lines and damaged buildings -- brought $1 billion or more in damages, according to NOAA.
Overall, the agency calculated that weather and climate disasters last year killed at least 474 people and resulted in damages costing over $165 billion in total, the third-most costly year since 1980. By comparison, in 2021, disaster damage costs totaled about $155.3 billion.
Storms and other extreme weather events are costly when they strike developed, population-dense centers, and many more people are vulnerable to such events, according to NOAA.
"We have more exposure, more people, more assets in harm's way," said Adam Smith, an applied climatologist at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.
Last year was the least active hurricane season since 2015, according to Karin Gleason, monitoring section chief at NOAA's NCEI, and one of only three years since 1950 in which no Atlantic storms formed in August. There were 14 named Atlantic storms last year, on the lower end of NOAA's forecast for the region. But powerful hurricanes are more frequent: Seven Category 4 or 5 hurricanes have made landfall in the past six years, Ms. Gleason said.
Multiple disasters arriving soon after each other are having compounding effects, NOAA scientists said. "Climate change is creating more and more intense, extreme events that cause significant damage and often sets off cascading hazards," said Dr. Spinrad, pointing to the current rain and flooding in California as an example. "Intense drought followed by devastating wildfires, followed by dangerous flooding and mudslides."
The annual average temperature across the continental U.S. was 53.4 degrees Fahrenheit, making 2022 the 18th warmest on record. The year prior, 2021, was the fourth-warmest year recorded, with an annual average of 54.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
Though there is some fluctuation between individual years, scientists have observed that over decades, global annual temperatures have been rising steadily. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared in 2021 that it was unequivocal that human activities have warmed the planet.

Full text: The Federal Reserve must avoid straying into political issues that aren't directly related to its economic-management objectives to protect its ability to bring down inflation without interference from elected officials, Chair Jerome Powell said.
The central bank remains strongly committed to lowering inflation by restraining economic growth through interest-rate increases, even though doing so could fuel political blowback, he said during a panel discussion with other central bankers in Sweden on Tuesday.
Bringing inflation down "can require measures that are not popular in the short term," Mr. Powell said. That made it all the more important, he added, for the central bank to "'stick to our knitting' and not wander off" into addressing issues that aren't directly linked to its mandate to keep inflation low and to support a strong job market.
"We are not, and will not be, a 'climate policy maker,'" Mr. Powell said.
Some Democrats and environmental groups have put pressure on the central bank to take a more activist role in policing bank lending decisions to address climate change. Mr. Powell made the case for a much more limited role in which the Fed monitors how banks are managing an array of financial risks, including those posed by climate change -- steps that have drawn disapproval from some Republicans and that were opposed last month by another Fed governor.
While other central bankers have taken bolder steps to tackle climate change through their oversight of the financial sector, Mr. Powell suggested he didn't think the Fed had the same authority to do so because the issue lacks clear political consensus in the U.S.
Using the Fed's banking-supervision authorities to take more aggressive steps on climate change would be inappropriate without more explicit instructions from Congress to do so, he said.
The Fed's institutional arrangements -- in which policy makers set interest rates without direct control by Congress or the White House, sometimes referred to as its independence -- allow the central bank to take unpopular steps to fight inflation and slow the economy without having to worry about short-term political factors, Mr. Powell said. He didn't otherwise comment on the Fed's coming interest-rate decisions.
The Fed raised its benchmark short-term interest rate aggressively last year, from near zero in March to just below 4.5% by the end of the year. Officials have signaled their intention to lift the rate above 5% this year, extending the fastest sequence of increases since the early 1980s to combat inflation that has also been near a 40-year high.
Separately, Fed governor Michelle Bowman said the central bank would need to continue increasing its benchmark rate, though incoming data would determine for how long and in what increment the Fed should lift it. Despite some signs of improvement in inflation, "we have a lot more work to do," she told an audience of bankers in Miami.
Mr. Powell has said the central bank is trying to avoid unnecessary economic damage, including higher unemployment, by slowing the pace of its rate rises. But he has repeatedly warned that there would likely be some pain in bringing down high inflation.

Full text: We were on our first hike across Greenland's spare tundra, when our guide knelt down to identify the low, yellow-leafed plants we'd been trampling. Just a couple of inches high, they were tiny willow trees. That, we learned, is how trees survive in the Arctic's harsh, blustery climate: They stick really close to the ground. So began a week-long master class in nature's survival strategies on a landscape that unfolds on extraordinary scales, both large and small. Lesson #1: When you hike in Greenland, you don't hike in the forest. You hike on top of it.
As I planned this journey to the land of plunging glaciers, perpendicular cliffs and northern lights, I mordantly joked to friends that I wanted to see Greenland before climate change transformed it for good. But honestly, my goals were less apocalyptic: I wanted to be challenged and immersed in untamed nature, and to avoid over-touristed wilderness destinations like Iceland.
I found it all in Greenland, where I could hike on the edge of the habitable world -- and still sleep in a comfortable bed at night. My husband and I booked passage on a small French ship, the MS Polarfront, for a trip through Scoresby Sound, the world's longest fjord system, on the less-traveled east coast of the world's largest island. With just 11 other passengers on board, our 9-day tour cost more than a voyage on a bigger boat, but it let us avoid buzz-killing crowds when ashore for daily hikes.
We were part of a growing flow of visitors to an unlikely tourist destination. Greenland is 836,300 square miles -- more than three times the size of Texas -- with a population of 56,500. Ice covers 80% of the landmass. All towns are on the coast, unconnected by roads, so visitors travel mostly by boat or plane.
Climate-change scientists who have found that the Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of the planet have spotlighted Greenland, putting the island on some "last chance tourism" itineraries. But the biggest obstacle to visitor growth remains Greenland's limited infrastructure. Few airports exist; even fewer handle international flights, and none of those fly direct from the U.S. But Greenland is building new airports and renovating existing ones to expand access over the next few years.
My husband and I were undaunted -- even attracted -- by the current logistical challenges of exploring Greenland. We booked our trip through Natural World Safaris, a British tour operator. Our group assembled in Reykjavik and took a charter flight to Constable Point, a tiny airport near Scoresby Sound. There we boarded the Polarfront, a former weather vessel that's found a new incarnation as a comfortable expedition ship. We'd spend nights and eat meals on the ship; by day, we'd go hiking ashore.
I'd imagined the Arctic to be barren and potentially monotonous, but every day we tackled dramatically different terrain. The first hike took us across classic tundra. Another day we climbed steep red-rock canyons reminiscent of the American Southwest. Other hikes traversed smooth, ancient gneiss slopes or fragile wetlands.
Some days we explored in Zodiac inflatable boats, buzzing around sparkling icebergs that were like a floating sculpture garden. The Zodiac also afforded prime wildlife viewing. With a good pair of binoculars, we spotted bearded seals, with their long drooping whiskers, lounging on floating ice. Grazing on a steep hillside were musk oxen -- shaggy, lumbering creatures seemingly conjured by Dr. Seuss. Eventually, we encountered the top of the Arctic food chain -- seven polar bears, including a mother and cubs. But we observed them from the safety of the Polarfront's front deck. On clear nights, the northern lights were dazzlingly on display.
When we returned to Constable Point for our flight back to Reykjavik, I was struck by how much my perspective had changed. When we'd first arrived the landscape had seemed cold, intimidating. A week later, I'd experienced a transformation of a sort best described by Barry Lopez, the masterful chronicler of the Arctic. "Like other landscapes that initially appear barren, arctic tundra can open suddenly, like the corolla of a flower, when any intimacy with it is sought," he writes in his 1986 book "Arctic Dreams." It will soon be easier and perhaps cheaper to visit Greenland. But maybe now is the time to go, before that intimacy gets harder to achieve.

Full text: COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- Top U.S. and European Union officials agreed to work closely to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, including sharing information about their respective programs to provide subsidies to promote domestic chip production.
At a Monday gathering to discuss trade and technology issues, however, the two sides failed to make progress on a dispute over the U.S.'s new electric-vehicle program that has strained bilateral ties, an issue that was raised by French President Emmanuel Macron during his meeting with President Biden last week.
European officials said they would continue to press Washington to address their concerns in the guideline the U.S. is set to roll out by Jan. 1 on how to implement the EV legislation.
The EU and the U.S.'s key Asian allies say the new EV subsidies, introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act, discriminate against their companies with its North American assembly and contents requirements.
The officials met outside Washington for a ministerial meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, a forum established last year to boost cooperation in areas such as advanced technology, supply chains and climate policies. The council is part of the Biden administration's effort to strengthen ties with allies and friendly partners to counter China's influence.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai represented Washington. European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis led the EU side.
Even as the EV dispute cast a shadow over the meeting, the two sides stressed concrete achievements made through the council framework, including the agreement on semiconductor supply chains, an area where both sides are accelerating efforts to beef up their domestic industries to cut reliance on Asian suppliers.
This year, the U.S. passed the Chips Act, a $280 billion measure to provide subsidies and support for research and development to increase domestic production.
The EU introduced similar legislation, raising concerns that global semiconductor companies may pit one against the other to get better deals or create oversupplies in the long run.
To address that, the Commerce Department and European Commission agreed to set up a common mechanism for sharing of information about public-support programs, including methodologies and best practices as well as developing common understanding of market dynamics.
They are also implementing an early-warning mechanism to address and mitigate semiconductor supply-chain disruptions.
"Transparency is a key tool to avoid concerns over public support programs," the U.S. and EU said in a statement.
Monday's meeting took place as governments from Europe, South Korea and Japan piled pressure on Washington to address their concerns about its EV subsidies program.
Following his meeting with Mr. Macron on Thursday, Mr. Biden said the U.S. could make "tweaks" to the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides subsidies to U.S. manufacturers and tax incentives for electric vehicles and other products that are assembled in North America.
Any changes would be designed to make it easy for European companies to participate in the program.
"We've heard concerns clearly from our European friends about certain specific aspects of legislation," Mr. Blinken said following Monday's meeting, adding that he is convinced there is a path forward.
"We need also to see what can be done within the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act," said Ms. Vestager. "But the most important thing is the U.S. is fully engaged in fighting climate change."
Meanwhile, the EU could modify its own subsidies and consider new funding in response to the inflation act, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said during a speech on Sunday.
The EU must "take action to rebalance the playing field where the IRA or other measures create distortions," Ms. von der Leyen said.
She said there is a risk the U.S. legislation could lead to unfair competition and fragment supply chains that were already tested by the pandemic.
Ms. von der Leyen raised the possibility of a European sovereignty fund, which she said could support companies working on clean-technology innovation and other climate-related projects.

Full text: Private-equity firm TPG Inc. has recruited former Wall Street power broker Tom Montag and partnered with several blue-chip companies to launch a carbon-credit business it hopes will add transparency and boost growth in the nascent market for emissions offsets.
The firm is investing $300 million in the new company, Rubicon Carbon, and aims to raise a total of $1 billion to kick-start the effort. Rubicon Carbon is intended to give buyers a simpler and safer way to invest in carbon credits.
Mr. Montag, who retired last year as chief operating officer of Bank of America Corp., is the new company's chief executive. Former BofA colleague Anne Finucane, who retired at the same time as a vice chair, is Rubicon's chairwoman.
The investment represents one of the private sector's largest efforts to expand the roughly $2 billion market for voluntary carbon credits that companies buy to offset their carbon emissions. Bank of America, the venture arm of JetBlue Airways Corp., and NGP Energy Capital Management have committed to invest in the new firm. General Electric Co., Honeywell International Inc. and McKinsey & Co. are among the companies helping launch the platform.
Carbon credits are seen as an important way to funnel private-sector money into efforts to limit climate change. They are typically tied to projects that preserve forests or replace fossil fuels with renewable energy in emerging markets.
The market was a focus of the recent global climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Negotiators are counting on the market to grow significantly to generate cash needed to fund climate initiatives.
The unregulated market has been criticized for inconsistent standards and potential conflicts of interest. It is run by a number of little-known nonprofits that verify and register credits before they can be sold. Concerns about whether projects actually reduce greenhouse-gas emissions have led some companies to move away from the market.
Wall Street has moved in, hoping to improve standards and profit from the growing industry. Other firms investing in the sector include J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Oak Hill Advisors LP.
Rubicon is partnering with brokers, satellite monitoring companies such as Planet Labs PBC and a TPG-backed company that creates and sells credits, Anew Climate. It aims to simplify the process of buying and managing credits, which has been daunting for all but the biggest businesses.
"We can become the Good Housekeeping seal of approval on their behalf," Ms. Finucane said.
The company's chief sustainability officer is Jennifer Jenkins, a forest offsets expert who previously held the same role at forest-offsets exchange NCX. She shared a Nobel Prize in 2007 for climate research.

Full text: Delegates at the recent COP27 climate summit in Egypt agreed to set up a fund to compensate poorer nations harmed by the effects of climate change. But figuring out the extent to which climate change causes the harm, and to which countries, is testing the limits of a new field known as attribution science.
The United Nations loss-and-damage fund aims to transfer money from wealthy nations to poor nations deemed especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Those eligible to receive funding include countries in Africa and Asia, as well as island nations in the Pacific and the Caribbean. Some analysts expect the annual financing needs of the countries to reach $290 billion to $580 billion by 2030.
Questions remain about how the fund will operate and whether it can act quickly to help affected countries. As officials work out the details, scientific uncertainty over the attribution of human-induced climate change to individual weather disasters risks deterring wealthy nations from contributing funds.
Attribution science is still evolving, said Richard Spinrad, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He said his agency's focus is on understanding the effects of climate change rather than pinpointing the causes of specific weather events. "I do not see NOAA getting involved in providing some attribution index for that typhoon or that hurricane," Mr. Spinrad said.
Some weather events are made worse by increased atmospheric and ocean temperatures and rising sea levels, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But it has been unable to attribute specific weather events to climate change.
Lisa Graumlich, a professor of environmental and forest sciences at the University of Washington, said scientists now face the challenge of developing tools to assess loss and damage and determine whether climate change is to blame for individual weather events.
"I think we're in some very undefined territory right now," said Ms. Graumlich, who is the president-elect of the American Geophysical Union.
In approving the fund, COP27 delegates cited devastating floods in Pakistan that killed an estimated 1,700 people and caused more than $30 billion in damages. Pakistan's delegation led the effort to get a loss-and-damage agreement on the COP27 agenda and pushed for its adoption.
A recent study of the floods yielded mixed results. The research, which hasn't been published in a journal, showed that total rainfall this year in the affected region was more than seven times as high as the historical average and that climate change had intensified rainfall in the region during a weeklong period in late August. In addition, computer models showed rainfall during that period was 75% more intense as a result of climate change than it would have been in the absence of climate change.
But the scientists didn't detect a role for climate change throughout the two-month monsoon season. Other factors, including strong La Nina ocean-temperature conditions in the Pacific region, might explain the 50% surge in rainfall intensity during the season, said Friederike Otto, lead author of the study and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College, London.

Full text: PARIS -- Governments left the United Nations climate summit this month with new doubts that global temperature increases can be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels -- but also with hope that a more-realistic goal, 1.7 degrees, is within reach.
The target of 1.5 degrees Celsius -- or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit -- has been the north star of U.N. climate negotiations since it was enshrined in the 2015 Paris accord. The deal calls for governments to cut greenhouse-gas emissions to levels that climate scientists estimate can limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial levels, with the ambition of keeping it below 1.5 degrees.
The Earth has warmed around 1.1 degrees since 1850, according to the U.N.'s latest climate-science report. That is largely because of an increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, caused by industrialization, the report says.
Limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees requires that global greenhouse-gas emissions fall around 43% by 2030 compared with 2019, according to the U.N. That works out to cuts of an average 5% every year through 2030, said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate scientist who coordinates the Global Carbon Project, a research consortium that provides estimates used by the U.N. The program estimates that fossil-fuel carbon-dioxide emissions alone this year are on track to rise 1% from last year. That doesn't include emissions from deforestation or methane, another potent greenhouse gas.
At the summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, the U.S., Europe and other developed nations sought new commitments to cut emissions this decade by phasing out fossil fuels. They were rebuffed by large developing nations such as China, India and Saudi Arabia.
In the end, the two sides settled on language from an agreement reached at last year's U.N. meeting in Glasgow that urged, but didn't require, countries to accelerate their plans for greenhouse-gas cuts. "I said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5 degrees was weak," said Alok Sharma, the U.K. climate envoy. "Unfortunately, it remains on life support."
Big economies, however, have made longer-term plans to cut emissions that some analysts say could limit warming in line with the Paris accord. China, by far the world's largest emitter, and India, the third-largest, last year pledged to become net-zero emitters of greenhouse gases by 2060 and 2070, respectively. If fulfilled, those commitments could limit warming to 1.8 degrees above preindustrial levels, according to the International Energy Agency, a club of large energy-consuming countries.
Before Sharm El Sheikh, the IEA lowered its estimate to 1.7 degrees, based on new emissions-cutting pledges from several countries -- in particular Indonesia and Australia -- and new agreements to reduce deforestation.
"That's a journey -- from well over 2 degrees to 1.8 to now 1.7 -- that we can be proud of, even as we recognize we are just getting started," U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said.
The world has about 18 more years of carbon-dioxide emissions at current rates to hit 1.7 degrees, rather than nine years left for 1.5 degrees, according to the Global Carbon Project.
Getting to 1.7 would also be a lot cheaper. The IEA estimates that meeting the warmer target would require global investment in clean energy to rise from $1.3 trillion annually to $3 trillion by 2030. Hitting 1.5 degrees would require spending $4.2 trillion by 2030 -- effectively doubling the investment represented by the energy sector from 2% of global annual gross domestic product to 4%.
Apart from the money, there is a little-known scientific reason why 1.7 degrees is a lot easier than 1.5 degrees. Sharp cuts in fossil-fuel burning, particularly coal, also reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides pollution. Those compounds transform into tiny droplets called aerosols that have helped cool the Earth -- by an estimated 0.5 degree -- by reflecting sunlight back into space.
"A lot of the reduction in CO2 is offset by the reduction in aerosols, specifically sulfur dioxides," said Daniel Crow, climate and energy modeler at the IEA.
Climate scientists say limiting warming to 1.7 degrees would still be a significant achievement. The 1.5 degree threshold isn't a tipping point above which the damage caused by climate change -- including rising sea levels, drought or heat waves -- accelerates. Rather, the damage grows steadily with each increment of warming. For example, the U.N.'s latest science reports estimates that between 70% and 90% of the world's coral reefs are expected to die out at 1.5 degrees of warming -- an estimate that grows to greater than 99% with 2 degrees of warming.
"The climate system is not like a cliff: before 1.5 everything is fine, as soon as you reach 1.5, it's the end of the world," said Mr. Friedlingstein. "We need to reduce emissions as fast as possible, and then see where we are."

Full text: The United Nations climate summit that just wrapped up in Egypt failed to reach agreement on some rules governing carbon credits, leaving in limbo a crucial mechanism for funneling cash to address climate change.
Negotiators repeatedly cited carbon credits as part of efforts to bring in private capital to help fund the transition away from fossil fuels. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry says the carbon market should be an important channel for climate finance moving from the rich world to developing countries.
But important details of a new U.N.-backed system for carbon trading were left unfinished at the summit, and a new rule could make things worse, according to people involved in the market.
Within the labyrinth of climate diplomacy, the corner that matters most for carbon markets is Article 6 of the 2015 Paris agreement. It sketches out an international system that countries could use to fund climate-benefiting activities in other parts of the world and count the emissions impact toward their national targets.
The broad rules were completed in Glasgow last year, but ironing out the details -- such as how to classify different activities, avoid double-counting and how the market should operate -- is proving difficult.
For businesses, a key uncertainty is how the U.N. system would interact with the voluntary carbon market.
The market was valued at less than $2 billion last year, according to data from Ecosystem Marketplace, and it doesn't remove anything close to the volumes of carbon dioxide that scientists say would be needed to cause noticeable change for the climate.

Full text: SINGAPORE -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met his Chinese counterpart for the first time in months, the latest sign of thawing ties between the two countries after a rupture in August following a trip to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Mr. Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe discussed bilateral ties and security matters on the sidelines of a gathering of defense ministers in Cambodia, the Pentagon said Tuesday. The meeting suggested that leaders of the world's two largest economies are engaging again after months of deep freeze.
Following Mrs. Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory, China said it would cancel or suspend cooperation with the U.S. on eight areas, including several military-to-military dialogue channels.
President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met this month at the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, the first in-person meeting between the men since Mr. Biden took office nearly two years ago.
On Saturday, Vice President Kamala Harris met with Mr. Xi at another summit in the Thai capital of Bangkok. There, Mr. Xi described his meeting with Mr. Biden as strategic and constructive, adding that he hoped the countries could reduce misunderstanding, said China's Foreign Ministry. Ms. Harris said the U.S. didn't seek confrontation and that both sides should cooperate on global issues, the Pentagon said.
In addition to the meetings with Mr. Xi, the U.S. and China have resumed talks on climate change in recent days. Suspending climate talks with the U.S. was among China's eight countermeasures after Mrs. Pelosi's trip.
Ties between the U.S. and China have deteriorated in recent years, as the countries tussle over trade, human rights and technology. Relations grew even more strained this year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and reached a nadir after Mrs. Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August.
Weeks afterward, advisers to Mr. Biden quietly opened back-channel talks with China, paving the way for the summit in Bali.
Although Mr. Xi didn't say so explicitly, Mr. Biden and his team came away from the meeting with the impression that China had no imminent plans to invade Taiwan, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
This month, Mr. Xi approved the dispatching of a delegation of senior policy advisers and business executives to New York to meet with a group of former top U.S. officials.
During the Tuesday meeting between the two countries' defense chiefs, Mr. Austin raised concerns about the activities of China's military, the People's Liberation Army, which he said could increase the risk of accidents, the Pentagon said. He also reiterated U.S. policies on Taiwan and urged China to refrain from further destabilizing the Taiwan Strait, the Pentagon said.
China's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said Gen. Wei reasserted China's sovereignty claims over Taiwan and warned against U.S. inference in the Taiwan Strait, while emphasizing the importance of maintaining regional security.
Both sides acknowledged the importance of maintaining communication channels, particularly during times of crisis.
As U.S.-China tensions have swelled, Taiwan in August boosted its annual military budget by nearly 13%, the largest such rise in at least 15 years. The island warned it would strike back against military incursions.

Full text: SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt -- Poorer countries secured a deal at United Nations climate talks to create a fund for climate-related damage as part of a broader agreement that failed to yield faster cuts in emissions wealthy nations sought to avert more-severe global warming.
The accord at the COP27 summit in this Egyptian seaside resort hands a victory to poorer nations that have demanded that money since the first U.N. climate treaty was signed three decades ago.
Other provisions of the broader agreement, reached early Sunday, left negotiators from wealthy countries disappointed in their efforts to secure faster cuts of greenhouse-gas emissions. Wealthy countries managed to preserve an agreement reached in Glasgow last year on emissions cuts after big developing countries tried to water it down, but they didn't secure new commitments.
Sunday's agreement also urges wealthy governments to overhaul multilateral development banks so those institutions can increase their funding to the developing world for renewable-energy projects and infrastructure to adapt to the effects of climate change.
That addresses long-running criticism from developing countries that say climate funds from institutions such as the World Bank are too hard to access and come with interest rates that are too high.
The agreement's most consequential provision would earmark money for what is known as loss and damage: when rising seas, more-powerful storms and other effects that most scientists link to climate change cause destruction that is sudden or potentially irreparable.
Negotiators representing developed and developing countries agreed to set up a fund in the final hours of the summit, defying expectations that they would not take that step amid resistance from the U.S. and other wealthy nations. The fund would be targeted toward poorer countries deemed most vulnerable, a key demand from wealthy nations that didn't want money flowing to China and other higher-income countries that are deemed developing economies under the U.N. climate treaty.
The creation of a new fund was a rallying cry for a coalition of developing nations -- stretching from small island states such as Barbados to low-lying and densely populated Bangladesh. These countries are thought to be most at risk from climate change but have emitted a small percentage of the greenhouse gases that scientists say have caused the earth to warm since the dawn of the industrial era.
The scale of monsoon rains and floods in Pakistan this year, with costs assessed at $30 billion, gave momentum to their campaign. Pakistani officials blamed climate change, and some scientists say it likely was a contributing factor.
"This COP has taken an important step towards justice," said Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the U.N. "Clearly this will not be enough, but it is a much-needed political signal to rebuild broken trust."
The decision leaves open the possibility that China, oil-rich Persian Gulf states and other higher-income countries in the developing world could contribute to the fund or provide money for other efforts to pay for loss and damage. The agreement creates a committee charged in the next year with "identifying and expanding sources of funding" and sorting out other details. Officials expect those decisions will be the subject of fierce debate in the coming months.
"What we wanted to get out of this COP was a political decision to have a fund funded by developed countries," said Vicente Paolo Yu, a negotiator for the Philippines.
Delegates from China, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the developing world say they have no obligation to contribute money. The U.N. climate treaty of 1992 designates them as countries that should receive funds from wealthy countries to respond to climate change. The U.S., Europe and other wealthy nations say that divide no longer makes sense given China's rapid economic growth over the past three decades and the vast wealth accumulated by Persian Gulf oil states.
Wealthy countries have long resisted creating a fund, fearing that agreeing to make payments would leave their governments and companies at risk of lawsuits.

Full text: SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt -- The European Union and Canada are willing to back the creation of a fund that would pay for damage linked to climate change in the most vulnerable countries -- but only if wealthier developing nations such as China contribute.
The proposal, made by the EU at United Nations climate talks in Egypt, calls into question China's status as a developing economy that traditionally receives climate funds from the wealthy world. China has been pushing for this climate-damage fund as part of a coalition of 133 developing nations.
The proposal seeks to break a deadlock at the COP27 talks about payments for what is known as loss and damage, when extreme weather that scientists link to global warming causes destruction that is sudden or potentially irreversible. The issue has emerged as the major sticking point in the final days of the summit, which was set to end Friday but was likely to stretch into the weekend.
A delegate for China, the world's largest emitter, said his country only would contribute to such a fund on a voluntary basis. Developed countries were trying to shift responsibility for making loss-and-damage payments, because they don't want to come up with the money, the delegate said.
A Saudi delegate said the EU proposal aims to more or less redefine what it means to be a developing nation.
Developing countries have pushed for the creation of a new fund to provide finance for damage that scientists say is growing as global temperatures rise. The U.S., Canada, Europe and other wealthy nations say a new fund isn't strictly necessary, and that money can flow from the institutions that already exist to finance the developing world's response to climate change.
Frans Timmermans, the EU climate envoy, said Friday the new fund could be established in as little as a year. In exchange, the EU is seeking new efforts from countries to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, including a commitment to hit peak global emissions before 2025.
The EU proposal would, for the first time, divide developing countries into different categories under the U.N. climate talks and put some of them on the hook for providing funds. Doing so has been a red line for China and other major developing economies since the U.N. climate treaty of 1992 established a clear divide: The U.S., European nations, Japan and a few other economies were considered the developed world, while most other countries were considered developing.
Canadian Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said the proposal goes in the right direction by focusing funding on the most vulnerable countries, while excluding higher-income ones like China and Saudi Arabia as potential funding recipients.
Developing nations say wealthy countries should be on the hook for funding because they bear responsibility for the bulk of historical emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere.
"They are really creating the scenario to shift the burden to developing countries," said Diego Pacheco, chair of the Like Minded Developing Countries group, which includes China, India and Pakistan.
Developed nations say the divide no longer makes sense given China's rapid economic growth and industrialization. Moreover, oil-rich countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates fall under the U.N.'s developing definition, angering the U.S. and European nations that are called upon to provide climate finance.

Full text: SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt -- Developing countries are pushing wealthy ones to accelerate plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions over the next decade, a new salvo in negotiations at the COP27 climate summit over which nations should shoulder more of the burden to limit global warming.
A draft text circulated on Thursday by Egypt, which is leading the talks, voices "deep regret that developed countries who have the most capabilities financially and technologically to lead in reducing their emissions continue to fall short in doing so."
The demand is a sign of the gulf separating developed and developing nations as the summit heads into its final days. Negotiators are far apart on several fronts, including how to keep the climate targets of the Paris accord within reach and how to provide funds for poorer countries that have suffered sudden or potentially irreparable damage that scientists link to the effects of climate change.
The text seeking faster emissions cuts from rich countries was drafted by the Like-Minded Developing Countries group, a coalition that includes big developing economies such as China, India and Pakistan, said Diego Pacheco, a Bolivian negotiator who chairs the group.
The text calls for developed countries to cut their emissions quickly enough that they would be net negative emitters of greenhouse gases by 2030. That means their emissions would be low enough that they could be more than offset by their forests and other natural means of absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Cuts of that speed would amount to a dramatic acceleration by the U.S., Europe and other wealthy nations. Most rich countries have pledged to become net-zero emitters by 2050.
Developed countries immediately dismissed the proposal.
"It's always good for developed nations to accelerate," said Frans Timmermans, the European Union climate envoy. "But let's stay real. 2030? Come on."
The dispute reflects longstanding tensions about how emissions cuts should be shared between developed and developing countries.
The developed world is responsible for most of the greenhouse-gas emissions that scientists say have caused global warming since the dawn of the industrial era.
Developing countries say their rich counterparts have released more than their fair share of emissions into the atmosphere.
China, however, is now the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases. Its emissions are expected to rise in the coming years as are India's, the third largest emitter. Emissions in the U.S. and Europe have been trending down for more than a decade.
Developed nations say big economies in the developing world should begin cutting their emissions sooner. Otherwise, they say, the world stands little chance of hitting the goals of the Paris accord: Limiting global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius and preferably 1.5 degrees.
Leaders from the Group of 20 economies this week reaffirmed their commitment to that climate target, reassuring negotiators from the U.S. and Europe. "We resolve to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C," the leaders said after their meeting, calling for "meaningful and effective actions" from all countries to hit the target.
China and India initially pushed to have the reference to the 1.5-degree limit excluded from the G-20's final statement, according to officials from two Gulf countries. China and India contended the energy crisis made the climate target unrealistic, the officials said.
On Saturday, U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry said some countries were hesitant to mention the 1.5-degree target in the negotiating text, without identifying them. "There are very few countries that have raised the issue of not mentioning this word or that word," he said.
A China delegate said the country helped come up with the language on the 1.5-degree limit in the G-20 statement and wasn't pushing for leniency on preventing global warming at the climate conference.
The India delegation at COP27 didn't respond to a request for comment.

Full text: SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt -- The revival of formal dialogue between the U.S. and China at United Nations climate talks in Egypt has thrown a diplomatic lifeline to negotiations that delegates say are rife with division.
Cooperation between the U.S. and China is critical if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, climate scientists say. Without the world's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide working together, they say, it will be impossible to meet the target of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius and preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Tensions between the two countries heading into the talks, known as COP27, fueled a sense of disarray at the summit, delegates said. Developing countries have clashed with wealthy ones over how much the West should pay for damage to developing economies that scientists have linked to climate change. Developing countries are also pushing wealthy ones to sharply accelerate their push to slash emissions. The war in Ukraine also looms over the talks, with many capitals focused on the security of their energy supplies.
The superpowers' top climate envoys, John Kerry and Xie Zhenhua, both told The Wall Street Journal that formal talks between the sides have resumed at the 27th U.N. climate conference taking place in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh.
Beijing had cut off communication with Washington on a range of issues, including climate change, in response to a visit this year by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, a democratically self-governed island China claims as part of its territory. With tensions between the U.S. and China still smoldering over Taiwan, trade and other points of contention, the fate of climate discussion beyond COP27 remains unclear.
Mr. Kerry rekindled in-person contact with his Chinese counterpart and longtime friend Mr. Xie before Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Biden met for the first time as heads of state at a Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, on Monday, marking a thaw in U.S.-China relations.
Mr. Biden told Mr. Xi that both sides needed to work together to address issues such as climate change, public health and global food security, according to the White House readout of the meeting. The Chinese official readout said both sides had agreed to work together to promote a successful COP27.
One Chinese delegate in Sharm El Sheikh said the U.S. and China were focused on pushing for progress together at the current COP, including how wealthier countries would pay developing nations for some of the losses they have suffered because of climate change.
China, which regards itself as a developing country, has said it supports the establishment of a new dedicated fund. The U.S. has been reluctant to throw its weight behind the idea of a fund, although Mr. Kerry says his country supports discussion on a "reasonable financing arrangement."
The personal friendship between Messrs. Kerry and Xie has been a driving force in keeping climate negotiations between the U.S. and China going even as tensions have flared between the two countries in recent years.
"John Kerry and Xie Zhenhua have always been more enthusiastic about climate collaboration than the non-climate people in their own respective administration," said Deborah Seligsohn, an American political science professor and former State Department official.
U.S. and Chinese climate negotiators helped seal the Paris climate accord in 2015. Climate cooperation came to a halt during the Trump presidency but was revived after Mr. Biden came to power.
On the sidelines of last year's U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, the U.S. and China surprised the world with a joint declaration on climate collaboration, putting a floor on floundering international negotiations. The two sides also established a bilateral working group to advance climate cooperation.
The chilly U.S.-China relationship loomed over the start of this year's summit, feeding fears among some delegates that the gathering would accomplish little.Still, Messrs. Kerry and Xie said they continued to exchange private emails and letters.
On Wednesday, Chinese envoy Mr. Xie played up the restart of formal negotiations, saying that compared with informal talks of recent months, "the difference is huge."

Full text: President Biden and President Xi Jinping of China sought to halt a rapid downward spiral in relations between Washington and Beijing, instructing officials to resume stalled talks on major global priorities, but the two countries acknowledged areas of deep disagreement that could disrupt those efforts.
Mr. Biden emerged from the meeting projecting cautious optimism, and a Chinese readout of the talks signaled a renewed willingness from Beijing to engage with the U.S.
"I absolutely believe there need not be a new Cold War," Mr. Biden said following the meeting on Monday, which took place in Bali, Indonesia, ahead of a summit of the Group of 20 major economies. "We're going to compete vigorously, but I'm not looking for conflict. I'm looking to manage this competition responsibly."
The first in-person meeting between the two leaders since Mr. Biden, a Democrat, became president stretched over about three hours, including a break. It came as relations between the two countries reached their lowest point in decades following an August visit to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and widening differences over a host of issues, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and trade.
Sending a message on Taiwan was China's top priority for the meeting, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Xi told Mr. Biden the self-governing island, which China claims as its territory, is the most significant red line in the China-U.S. relationship that can never be crossed, according to the Chinese readout. Mr. Xi said that Taiwanese independence was as incompatible to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as "fire and water."
Any possible visits from senior U.S. politicians to Taiwan could be seen by the Chinese as provocative actions and could raise the possibility of a clash between the superpowers, according to people familiar with the matter. Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the chamber's GOP leader, has said he would visit Taiwan if he becomes speaker. Republicans are inching toward taking back control of the House.
Mr. Biden said in a news conference after the meeting that he didn't think China would make an imminent attempt to invade Taiwan and stressed that longstanding U.S. policy toward the island hasn't changed. During the talks with Mr. Xi, he raised objections to what the White House called China's coercive and increasingly aggressive actions toward Taiwan.
He also expressed concerns with China's treatment of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and Beijing's suppression of civil liberties in Hong Kong, according to the White House.
Mr. Biden described Mr. Xi as direct and straightforward and said he believes the Chinese leader is willing to compromise on some issues, though he didn't name them. He said he sought to make his intentions clear to Mr. Xi in order to avoid miscommunications that could inflame tensions.
The talks Monday signaled a reopening of communication lines between the two sides that largely ruptured after Mrs. Pelosi's Taiwan visit. Beijing responded to that trip by conducting military drills and suspending climate talks and a broad range of law-enforcement cooperation with the U.S., while canceling some two-way military dialogues.
The White House said the two leaders had empowered senior officials to deepen talks on issues ranging from climate change to food security. Mr. Biden also tasked Secretary of State Antony Blinken with visiting China to follow up on Monday's meeting.
The two countries planned the talks over several months and dozens of hours of negotiations, after Messrs. Biden and Xi decided during a July phone call to work toward setting up an in-person meeting. While it was the first face-to-face meeting between them as their countries' top leaders, the two have had five virtual or phone meetings since last year and extensive interactions when they served as vice presidents of their respective countries.
Mr. Xi claimed a norm-breaking third term as Communist Party chief in late October, when he also elevated loyalists into the party's top echelons. The personnel reshuffle is expected to continue until China's annual legislative session in the coming spring, where top state positions -- including the premiership and other cabinet roles -- will be formalized. The Chinese leader brought newly empowered members of his leadership to Monday's meeting.
Daniel Russel, a former Obama administration official handling Asia affairs, said the meeting achieved two important outcomes: an extended discussion between the presidents focusing on their strategic visions and the agreement to empower senior officials to engage in a sustained effort to work on managing bilateral differences.
"Laying out each leader's 'priorities and intentions' is precisely the kind of conversation that Xi and Biden needed to have," said Mr. Russel, who is now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. "What each of them heard from the other, however tough, is certainly less alarming than the stream of worst-case analyses they receive daily from within their systems."
The White House said the two leaders agreed that "a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won and underscored their opposition to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine." Though Mr. Xi has signaled his concerns about the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine before, the White House was eager for the Chinese president to reiterate that stance during the meeting, officials said.
The readout from the Chinese government didn't include mention of the nuclear threat. Instead, Mr. Xi restated China's support for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and expressed hope that the U.S., European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will commence comprehensive talks with Moscow.
A draft statement to be considered by leaders of the Group of 20 economies at their summit beginning Tuesday describes the conflict in Ukraine, which Russia calls a special military operation, as a war, according to a Western official. It also includes language on the unacceptability of the use of nuclear weapons in the conflict.
The draft statement signals that Russia could agree to continue the grain deal -- which allows for the safe passage of grain exports from war-torn Ukrainian ports through the Black Sea to world markets -- beyond this week. It says the G-20 leaders emphasize "the full, timely and continued implementation" of the deal agreed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations to unblock Ukrainian grain exports to ease food pressures in the developing world, the official said.
The Black Sea Initiative is due to expire Friday, and negotiators are working to extend it.

Full text: The U.S. government and United Nations are touting plans for businesses to funnel billions of dollars to developing nations to fight climate change. The efforts rely on a tiny carbon-credit market that has struggled for years with uneven standards and conflicts of interest.
A global effort unveiled by U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and a U.N. Africa-focused credit initiative are two of the hallmark pledges of the climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The goal is to fill the financing gap to fund the transition to clean energy in developing countries.
The U.S. and other wealthy nations have promised roughly $100 billion annually, but have fallen short by about $20 billion a year recently, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
To make up the difference, the two initiatives envision developing countries selling carbon credits to companies seeking to become carbon neutral. Credits are typically tied to projects that keep trees standing or replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.
About $2 billion in credits were sold last year, according to environmental markets data analyst Ecosystem Marketplace.
Sales were up 11% in the first three quarters of 2022 compared with the same period last year, according to carbon-market data firm AlliedOffsets.
Growth in the market has accelerated in recent years, but it would have to get dramatically bigger to fill the financing gap. Some of that depends on the willingness of companies, which are under pressure from customers, regulators and investors to reduce emissions, to buy the credits. Another factor is concerns about standards in the unregulated market.
The market is opaque and lacks formal oversight. Private developers acquire funding and land to implement projects. They work with nonprofit accreditors to create credits that are often sold to brokers who trade them at a premium and capture much of the value before selling them to corporate polluters or individuals.
"Do the carbon credits actually remove or avoid emissions?" said Chris Cote, Americas lead for environmental, social and governance -- or ESG -- and climate research at index provider MSCI. "Detailed, independent and reliable information on the quality of those offset projects -- whether from building renewable energy or avoiding deforestation -- is still emerging."
Mr. Kerry and others say their new plan can avoid past pitfalls, unlock tens of billions of dollars and help companies mitigate unavoidable emissions, such as those caused by the usage of their products. Focusing on entire jurisdictions and countries for credits rather than individual projects will help ensure benefits, they argue.
Critics say that even if the programs successfully fill the funding gap, they will fall far short of the trillions of dollars needed for renewables to reduce carbon emissions. "If this is the big breakthrough for the week, we're in trouble," said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School.
The current U.N. climate conference has been marked by diminished expectations as countries and businesses grapple with inflation, energy shortages and slowing economies.
Many companies say they are doing the legwork to meet their previous commitments, but some environmentalists worry that pressure is easing on businesses, particularly holdouts that have yet to publish targets. A U.N. green finance alliance with banks and others has been plagued by miscommunication, with some U.S. lenders fighting what they perceived as efforts to force them to cut off funding for fossil-fuel producers.
The lack of new private-sector initiatives at this year's summit has increased focus on voluntary credits. African nations are looking to tap the voluntary markets to raise money for renewable projects.
A U.N. coalition of 13 countries including Nigeria and Kenya announced an initiative last week to produce 300 million credits a year by 2030 with the target of raising $6 billion. Gabon recently certified about 90 million credits and is hoping some sell for more than $20 a unit.
Both the U.N. Africa initiative and the new plan unveiled by the U. S. -- known as the Energy Transition Accelerator -- say they will work with banks including Standard Chartered PLC and expert groups such as one involving former central banker Mark Carney to ensure success. Mr. Carney also co-leads the U.N. green finance alliance, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.
The carbon-market task force he is working with has rebranded, scaled back its ambitions and is developing criteria to ensure the effectiveness of carbon credits. Another is working to publish guidelines about the types of claims corporate buyers can advertise regarding their carbon footprint after purchasing offsets.
Regulators such as the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission also are reviewing credit markets.
Mr. Kerry said last Wednesday the framework of the Energy Transition Accelerator would be ironed out next year and financing should start in 2024. Business partners such as PepsiCo Inc. said the details would determine their participation.
Some analysts want to see more direct corporate commitments for renewable power in emerging markets. Wind and solar power are already cost-competitive and make sense in many locations without being linked to voluntary corporate credits, they say.
"What we need is actual emissions stoppages -- not trading of credits," said Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.

Full text: SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt -- President Biden is moving to tighten restrictions on emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and boost funding for developing countries to adapt to the effects of climate change and transition to cleaner technologies, according to the White House.
Mr. Biden announced the measures in a speech before a United Nations climate conference, known as COP27. The measures include plans for the Environmental Protection Agency to require oil-and-gas companies to monitor existing production facilities for methane leaks and repair them, administration officials said.
Methane is 80 times as potent at trapping heat from solar radiation as carbon dioxide over its first 20 years in the atmosphere. It is responsible for about half a degree Celsius of global warming since the preindustrial era, and its levels are rising fast, according to measurements made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The planned rules affect hundreds of thousands of U.S. wells, storage tanks and natural-gas processing plants, and require companies to replace leaky, older equipment and buy new monitoring tools.
EPA Administrator Michael Regan said flaring -- a technique used by gas producers to burn off excess methane from oil and natural-gas wells -- would be reduced at all well sites under the planned rules. Owners would be required to monitor abandoned wells for methane emissions and plug any leaks, he said.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents U.S. oil and gas producers, said it is reviewing the proposed rule.
"Federal regulation of methane crafted to build on industry's progress can help accelerate emissions reductions while developing reliable American energy," said Frank Macchiarola, API's senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs.
Rachel Cleetus, lead economist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the EPA had "taken an important step forward by issuing a robust standard for methane emissions from oil-and-gas operations."
The White House said Mr. Biden is expected to announce an additional $100 million for the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which helps countries adapt to floods, droughts and storms that climate scientists say are increasing in frequency and severity as the Earth's atmosphere and oceans warm. The U.S. has yet to pay the $50 million it pledged to the fund at last year's climate talks in Glasgow.
The U.S. also owes $2 billion to the U.N. Green Climate Fund, which finances renewable energy and climate adaptation projects in the developing world. The administration has asked for $1.6 billion for the fund in the fiscal 2023 budget.
The White House said Mr. Biden would also pledge $150 million to a U.S. fund for climate adaptation and resilience across Africa; $13.6 million to the World Meteorological Organization to collect additional weather, water and climate observation across Africa; and $15 million to support the deployment of early-warning systems in Africa by NOAA in conjunction with local weather-forecasting agencies.
The U.S. pledges don't address demands from poorer nations to provide money for damage they say is the result of climate-related weather events -- a new category of funding known as "loss and damage." This week at the summit, Belgium and Germany pledged a combined 172 million euros, equivalent to $176 million, to support loss-and-damage payments to developing countries. Scotland pledged $5.8 million and Ireland pledged $10 million.
U.S. negotiators are concerned the concept exposes wealthier nations to spiraling liability. There is also the scientific uncertainty of determining which effects can be tied to human-induced climate.

Full text: China has sent a large delegation to the United Nations climate summit in Egypt, but it is unlikely to bow to demands to strengthen its pledge to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, China energy experts say.
The country wants to appear independent, rather than in collaboration with the U.S., when it makes any new climate commitments, they say. It is facing criticism from the U.S. and other countries that its pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions aren't aggressive enough.
China may go beyond its commitments without making any new pledges. It is leading the world in sales of electric vehicles and installation of renewable energy. The trajectory of its economy could lead to a meaningful slowing of emissions growth.
The world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter isn't unusual among attendees at the U.N. conference, which is taking place in an Egyptian resort city over the next two weeks. It is buying more oil and gas from Russia. Concerns about energy security have meant the country is digging up more coal at home.
China has had its own changes in the past year. Its relationship with the West has deteriorated, and there has been a crackdown on its overheated real-estate market. Some economists say the latter could signal a permanent slowing in the rate of economic growth and energy demand.
The country's emissions dropped sharply during the 12 months ended in June, driven by wide-ranging Covid-19 lockdowns and a property-market slowdown.
What happens when they rebound "depends heavily on the economic policy direction that the leadership chooses," said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Finland-based research organization the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, or CREA.
China's greenhouse-gas emissions are so large that the world won't get far in curbing global warming unless they come down. The country generates roughly a third of the world's carbon dioxide, much of it from burning coal in power plants and for industrial use such as making steel and cement.
At COP27, as the conference is known, China is unlikely to update its pledge of reaching peak emissions before 2030 and becoming carbon neutral before 2060, people familiar with the matter said. Instead, it will focus on implementing current climate goals, Li Gao, director of the climate-change department at China's Ministry of Environment and Ecology, told reporters at a press briefing on Oct. 27.
U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said at a Wall Street Journal event that he had spoken during the conference with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, although he added that the two countries still haven't restarted formal discussions that halted a few months earlier.
Mr. Xie said separately that China had completed a plan for the reduction of methane emissions, first promised in a joint U.S.-China declaration at last year's global climate conference, but he didn't say when it would be released. Before U.S.-China climate talks broke down, experts had expected the two countries might unveil their methane plans together at COP27.
By some measures, China is beating its climate goals by building out renewable energy faster than anywhere else. Some analysts expect the country to add 150 gigawatts in solar and wind capacity this year, nearly as much as the amount in operation in Germany and France combined.
But China is also playing it safe by boosting investment in coal, a fuel the country can mine in abundance at home but which is also responsible for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions. Chinese officials say they need a stable and secure source of energy in the wake of turbulent global energy markets and a series of power shortages that have rattled the country during the past year.
Critics point out that China consumes more than half of the world's coal and shouldn't be burning more.
"Instead of trying to phase out coal or cap it at current levels," China is positioning itself to burn more coal "for the foreseeable future," says Pavel Molchanov, an energy-transition analyst at financial-services company Raymond James & Associates who predicts the country won't manage to cap emissions by 2030.

Full text: Bangladesh reached a preliminary agreement for a $4.5 billion assistance package with the International Monetary Fund as it seeks to cushion its economy from the impact of the war in Ukraine and risks posed by climate change.
The emergence of Bangladesh's export-oriented garment-manufacturing industry helped turbocharge economic growth and propel average incomes -- and several indicators of human well-being -- above those of South Asian neighbors India and Pakistan. But high inflation, a plunging local currency and recession concerns in the U.S. and Europe -- its main export markets -- have placed one of the world's fastest-growing economies of the past decade under mounting financial pressure.
"Bangladesh's robust economic recovery from the pandemic has been interrupted by Russia's war in Ukraine, leading to a sharp widening of the current-account deficit, rapid decline of foreign-exchange reserves, rising inflation and slowing growth," said the IMF's mission chief to Bangladesh, Rahul Anand, at the conclusion of a two-week visit to the country on Wednesday.
Since July, Bangladesh authorities have rationed electricity amid a heat wave and natural-gas shortage after shutting all 10 of its diesel power plants as Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove up the cost of imported fuel.
Rising fuel prices and soaring living costs have sparked sporadic protests, ahead of general elections to be held by the end of next year, and affected the all-important apparel industry.
The government also shortened office and school hours to conserve energy and ordered reduced use of air conditioners in mosques across the Muslim-majority country. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday repeated calls for citizens to be frugal with power use and to cut back on luxury spending, state media reported.
A low-lying riverine country of some 165 million people prone to extreme weather events and flooding, Bangladesh is routinely listed among the top countries most vulnerable to climate-change risks. The $4.5 billion package, to be disbursed over the next three-and-a-half years, includes a $1.3 billion loan under the IMF's new climate-focused Resilience and Sustainability Fund.
The staff-level agreement is subject to IMF executive-board approval, which the fund said is expected in the coming weeks.
Bangladesh is the third South Asian country, after Sri Lanka and Pakistan, to turn to the IMF for assistance this year. Unlike Sri Lanka, which delayed its approach to the global lender until it had all but entirely drained its foreign reserves -- leaving it unable to afford essential imports of fuel and medicines -- Bangladesh has moved pre-emptively to shore up its financial position, and external debt levels remain healthy, economists and the IMF say.
Yet while Bangladesh's foreign reserves are still sufficient to provide ample import cover of about four months, they have fallen to below $35 billion from $45.5 billion last year, according to official figures.

Full text: The U.S. outlined a new carbon-credit plan that aims to pump billions of dollars into developing countries' energy transition, while some businesses expressed caution about investing in the program.
On Wednesday, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry presented the program, called the Energy Transition Accelerator, at United Nations climate talks in Egypt. The program, he said, aims to enlist investors in efforts to reduce emissions across entire regions or countries by paying developing nations to shut down fossil-fuel energy sources and accelerate the construction of renewable energy.
The current $2 billion carbon-credit market is unregulated, leading to what critics consider low-quality projects that don't yield durable emissions reductions. Some firms have pledged not to rely on carbon offsets, saying the credits shouldn't substitute for more direct action to wean their operations off fossil fuels. U.S. officials aim to raise tens of billions of dollars in new funding through ETA.
Carbon credits are typically issued by projects that preserve forests, which absorb greenhouse gases, or by renewable-energy projects that replace fossil fuels, with each credit representing the reduction or removal of one ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Polluters subtract their carbon-credit purchases from their annual carbon footprints to claim carbon-neutral operations. One weakness under the current system is that it grants credits for building individual renewable-energy projects, but doesn't ensure that there are net emissions reductions across a broader area.
"Unfortunately, some past abuses have in many minds discredited the use of a carbon credit," Mr. Kerry said. "But we also know that with the right safeguards, with the right transparency, with the right accountability for the right crediting, this can be done well."
In pushing national and regional governments to oversee the issuance of credits, the U.S. program aims to ensure that any reduction in emissions from one project isn't undermined by the creation of new fossil-fuel projects elsewhere in the area. That would give investors confidence to increase the flow of money to emissions-reduction efforts, Mr. Kerry said.
The program will include restrictions on how companies can use the credits they purchase, he said. Fossil-fuel producers wouldn't be allowed to buy them, Mr. Kerry said, and other restrictions would stop companies from buying them to avoid reducing their own emissions.
"They must use these credits to supplement, not substitute for deep reductions of their own emissions," he said. "If you apply it in a way that isn't double counting, that's not greenwashing."
Zaheer Fakir, South Africa's lead climate negotiator, said the carbon-credit plan is no substitute for money the U.S. is supposed to be providing under U.N. climate treaties. The U.S. said at last year's U.N. conference in Scotland that it would give $50 million to the U.N. Adaptation Fund, but the money hasn't arrived. U.S. officials say they are working to get it approved by Congress. The U.S. also still has $2 billion in arrears to the U.N. Green Climate Fund, which provides climate finance to the developing world.
"Anything to deflect from their failures to be a responsible multilateral party," he said.
The U.S. said the credits issued under the program couldn't be used to comply with legal limits on carbon-dioxide emissions, such as those in California or the European Union.
The Paris accord of 2015 calls for global emissions in the second half of the century to reach net zero, meaning man-made greenhouse-gas emissions are so low they can be completely offset by forests and other natural means of absorbing them from the atmosphere. Scientists say achieving net-zero emissions is crucial for hitting the Paris accord's climate targets: Limiting global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius and preferably to 1.5 degrees.
Under one U.S. proposal, companies would have to commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions across their operations by 2050 to qualify for the program.
The U.S. also proposed allowing companies to use the credits to offset a portion of a company's so-called scope 3 emissions under the Science Based Targets initiative, a collaboration between the U.N., companies and environmental groups to cut corporate emissions in line with the Paris accord. Those are the emissions not produced directly by a company's facilities or the electricity they consume but by its suppliers or during the use of its products.
Jim Andrew, chief sustainability officer of PepsiCo Inc., said he was looking to understand how long the carbon credits would last and whether they can be counted toward reducing the company's scope 3 emissions before committing any funds. "These are the details still to be worked out," he said from the sidelines of the climate talks.
Fast-fashion giant H&M is wary of using credits to offset its scope 3 emissions. The company is focused on cutting its total emissions, most of which are produced by its fabric suppliers in developing countries that rely heavily on coal.
"Within our own emissions and our value chain, carbon credits are not really something that the science says we should have," said Henrik Sundberg, who leads H&M's climate division. The company might consider using credits to offset residual emissions to reach its goal of net-zero by 2040, H&M executives said.
Mr. Kerry said he has garnered support from several countries for his plan. He said he expects an interim framework to be working by the 2023 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates, and financing to start in 2024.
Olanrewaju Shasore, senior assistant to Nigeria's vice president on policy planning, said she hopes the U.S. plan would attract private investors to the country's efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2060. "Unfortunately, access to private capital hasn't been accessible to us for too long," she said.
Mahmoud Mohieldin, a U.N. official working with businesses to implement the Paris agreement, and former Egyptian investment minister, was cautious about the U.S. plan. Egypt is lining up wind and solar power to replace fossil fuel, projects that he said are ready to soak up funding from the U.S. program.
"We need to see the money," he said.

Full text: FAYOUM, Egypt -- Armyworms have ravaged Mohamed Abdel Tawab's maize crop, the result of increasingly frequent heat waves in this central Egyptian oasis that lies to the west of the Nile.
In recent years, the changing weather patterns have helped give rise to pests that have attacked his tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchinis and eggplants. This year, he tried to plant clover, but the weather was too hot and no sprouts appeared.
"It's a disaster," he said, looking down at the barren earth. "It's as if our land is burning."
Egyptian farmers are struggling after changing weather patterns have brought bouts of unusually intense heat and record-low temperatures.
The Nile Delta is considered one of the most vulnerable large deltas in the world to be directly affected by climate change by 2050, according to the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Egypt derives 60% of its agriculture from this region, which, in addition to being subject to changing weather conditions, is suffering from erosion and flooding.
Egypt's agriculture sector has few means of adapting to climate change because the country is mostly desert terrain. It draws a finite amount of water each year from the Nile, and farmers in the north are suffering from decreased flows and pollution. The majority of Egypt's farmers own small plots of land, and are too poor to upgrade to more modern agriculture practices.
Egypt is the host of the U.N. climate change conference, known as COP27, that began on Sunday in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm El Sheikh.
Water issues are on the agenda -- including rising sea levels resulting from climate change in the Nile Delta area. Egyptian officials have highlighted the agriculture sector, in Egypt and worldwide, as being most vulnerable to climate change. They have pushed for rich nations to increase support for Egypt and other developing countries that are suffering as a result of global carbon emissions.
Egypt depends on countries such as Ukraine for imported crops such as wheat and was hit by rising food prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. All homegrown wheat is sold to the government to produce subsidized bread for the poor.
In the past year, abnormal weather conditions have ruined his family's mangoes, dates, corn and tomatoes, says Nadi Abdallah, a 72-year-old farmer in Kom Ombo, an agricultural town in southern Egypt.
On a recent hot day Mr. Abdallah pointed to a dead baby mango tree that had succumbed to last winter's frost, as well as cabbage shoots that were growing more slowly than they should because of the heat.
"It's exhausting," Mr. Abdallah said. "We don't know if what we get will cover our expenses."
This year, Egyptian authorities launched a national strategy for tackling climate change for 2050, in which the government would spend $113 billion for adaptation programs. It envisions almost half of that budget going to agriculture, although it says most of the money has yet to be raised.
President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi has said water- and food-security challenges associated with climate change are a matter of national security.
Mr. Tawab, the corn farmer in Fayoum, says some of his maize was untouched by the armyworms because he planted a small batch early on, before the height of the summer season.
The few husks that did appear were tiny, however. They will go to his farm animals and, next year, Mr. Tawab will give up on corn completely.

Full text: SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt -- U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said Tuesday that he spoke with his Chinese counterpart during the COP27 United Nations climate conference, rekindling contact between countries that are pivotal in the global effort to limit greenhouse-gas emissions.
"We need to be talking to each other because we're the two biggest economies in the world and the two biggest emitters," Mr. Kerry told The Wall Street Journal at a live event at the Egyptian seaside resort where the 27th U.N. climate gathering is taking place.
The exchange between Mr. Kerry and China's top climate envoy Xie Zhenhua marks a thaw in U.S.-China relations, though Mr. Kerry said the two countries have yet to resume formal discussions.
Mr. Xie said separately that China would continue to participate in global climate governance and asked developed countries to take the lead in scaling up their climate targets, and to fulfill their financial obligations tied to climate.
Years of climate talks between China and the U.S. broke down in August, after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, a democratically self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. The Chinese government has said that restarting dialogue would require the U.S. to rethink its posture on Taiwan and stop escalating tensions.
"We have a common interest in working together to try to reduce emissions," said Mr. Kerry.
Mr. Xie said that China's goal to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 would include all greenhouse gases and that it had a methane reduction plan for the energy, agriculture and waste sector. In last year's joint declaration with the U.S., China said it would publish a plan on how to cut methane emissions this decade before COP27.
The meeting came ahead of President Biden's planned visit to Southeast Asia, where he may meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
"It's conceivable that when they meet in Bali, something may break through," said Mr. Kerry, who also called on China to move faster to reduce carbon emissions and its dependency on coal.
Apart from tensions with China, the war in Ukraine and midterm elections in the U.S. have loomed over COP27 and efforts by world leaders to curb greenhouse-gas emissions.
Mr. Kerry pushed back on the issue of whether industrialized countries should pay compensation to developing countries that are most affected by severe flooding, drought and storms that scientists say are made worse by the effects of climate change. Such payments, known as "loss and damage," would create a new category of funding in addition to funds the West is already sending to the developing world to help it adapt to climate change and shift to cleaner technologies.
Instead, Mr. Kerry called on the private sector and multilateral development banks to provide more capital. "What we need is financial instruments that are as modern as the challenges are complex," he said.
On Wednesday, the U.S. climate envoy will propose a new carbon-credit program that aims to raise tens of billions of U.S. dollars from businesses and governments in wealthy economies to help developing countries cut back on fossil fuels, the Journal reported.

Full text: Museums are enacting "zero bag" policies, putting prized paintings behind glass and hiring ex-British and Israeli military pros to teach their guards surveillance tactics after a series of climate-change protests have left the world's most famous art slathered in mashed potatoes and tomato or pea soup.
"Museums have always been aware of people trying to steal their art," said Remigiusz Plath, head of infrastructure and security for Germany's Hasso Plattner Foundation, whose Claude Monet "Grainstacks" recently got doused in mashed potatoes at Potsdam's Barberini Museum. Glass helped protect the Monet. But warding off vandals wielding groceries who claim they don't want to damage the art, he said, "That threat is definitely new."
On Friday, Germany's Last Generation activists were back at it, sloshing pea soup on Vincent Van Gogh's 1888 "The Sower" at Rome's Palazzo Bonaparte. Paris's Orsay Museum said it foiled an Oct. 27 attempt by a Just Stop Oil activist to throw soup on one of its paintings.
Both canvases were protected behind glass, but museums say they're getting fed up. Amotz Brandes, a former member of the Israeli military, said museums are enlisting his California security consulting and training firm, Chameleon Associates, to learn counter-maneuvers. One tactic he suggests: Watch for visitors who show up solo yet start communicating with others once inside using nonverbal gestures, like pointing.
"It's all about early detection," Mr. Brandes said.
One of the art world's strangest showdowns is pitting museums against environmental activists who since spring have smuggled in and tossed all sorts of foodstuffs onto some of the world's most famous artworks. Protesters say such actions draw attention to the doomsday effects of climate change. Curators complain the world's masterpieces are being endangered as political pawns.
Activists have long come to museums to advocate for everything from women's voting rights to nuclear disarmament, sometimes violently.The Louvre Museum's "Mona Lisa" weathered red spray paint and an acid-throwing attempt decades before this May when a man disguised as an old woman smeared cake frosting on the glass covering Leonardo da Vinci's portrait, telling onlookers to think of the planet's welfare.
Protesters today vow they don't want to harm the art, but the latest round of vandalism comes as museums are already struggling to rebuild their coffers, staffing and attendance levels since the pandemic. Redoubling security measures now could prove too costly.
Robert Wittman, a former art-crime investigator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who said he keeps in touch with museum security personnel, said most museums can't stretch their current budgets to quickly hire more guards or install noticeable security measures like metal detectors, which wouldn't detect food, anyway.
In Europe, where the food-related attacks have so far taken place, Mr. Wittman said guards rarely even check visitors' bags. Food is often allowed on museum grounds so visitors can have picnics.
For now, more museums are turning to the kinds of security consulting firms that typically work with major sporting venues or airports to teach their museum guards ways to spot suspicious activity.
Mr. Brandes at Chameleon said he's tested more than a dozen museums by sending in what he calls "red teams," or role-playing protesters, to mill around galleries scouring for security cameras, he said, or head straight to a famous painting and then leave rather than strolling around afterward like a regular tourist might. He coaches museum guards to eye such activities more closely.
Security firms say the Louvre is widely hailed for having Europe's toughest museum security protocols including bag checks, but its guards still weren't able to stop the cake-smearing man in May, and incidents have only accelerated since.
In August, protesters used glue to affix themselves to treasures including the Vatican's marble "Laocoon and His Sons." Vincent Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" was hit with tomato soup on Oct. 14. (The bouquet was protected behind glass, but its frame was slightly damaged.) On Oct. 27, a man tried gluing his own head to the glass covering Johannes Vermeer's "Girl with a Pearl Earring" at the same time as a peer poured soup on him at The Hague's Mauritshuis. The dinosaur displays at Berlin's Natural History Museum were targeted on Oct. 30.
Heavyweights like the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York or the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles aren't divulging their battle plans for fear of putting their art under an unwanted spotlight -- but curators and environmental activists agree that U.S. museums will be targeted, eventually.
Hollywood is already playing a role in funding the climate activist groups behind the global food fight. Arguably the highest-profile entity donating millions to protesters now is Beverly Hills' Climate Emergency Fund, an umbrella-like fundraising nonprofit supported by "Don't Look Up" director Adam McKay and co-founded in 2019 by Aileen Getty, a philanthropist and granddaughter of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty.
Mr. McKay declined through his publicist to comment, but when he joined the fund's board in September he said he admired its "civil, nonviolent, disruptive activism." The climate fund confirmed the director has donated $1 million and pledged an additional $3 million to the fund.
Ms. Getty, in an email, said she has no say or sway over the groups' disruptions but allows the fund's moneys to be used only for legal activities. She confirmed that her namesake foundation initially gave $1 million to co-found the climate fund, which in the past year has given out $4.6 million to 43 activist groups such as Just Stop Oil.
She said the climate fund's money can be used to help recruit and train protesters but can't be used to pay for any illegal, soup-throwing activities.
The fund said its donations also can't be used to cover any legal bills for protesters after museum incidents, including the two protesters in the "Sunflowers" case who were later charged with causing criminal damage. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said the pair didn't hurt the art; they pleaded not guilty.
Ms. Getty, a self-taught artist whose grandfather founded the Getty museum, said it matters to her that protesters are intentionally targeting pieces behind glass, lessening the risk of causing any lasting damage.
A Getty museum spokeswoman said it has no official ties to its namesake family anymore.
Mr. Plath said he's rushing to put more of the Barberini's pieces behind glass in part because he thinks activists will take increasingly drastic measures to stay in the public eye, adding, "It's the escalation that worries me."
Margaret Klein Salamon, the climate fund's executive director, said activists aren't trying to drive museums crazy. Earlier actions like gluing themselves to fuel tankers or protesting in front of oil terminals just never captured the same amount of attention. "Frankly, this is the thing that's worked," she said.

Full text: SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt -- U.S. climate envoy John Kerry is planning to propose a new carbon-credit program that aims to increase funding from businesses and governments in wealthy economies to help developing countries cut back on fossil fuels.
Mr. Kerry said in an interview that he plans to make the proposal at the United Nations climate-change conference in Egypt on Wednesday, adding that he was still consulting with representatives of other countries on the size and structure of the program.
A U.S. official familiar with the matter said the program aims to raise tens of billions of dollars by boosting the ability of regions and countries in the developing world to sell credits when they shut down fossil-fuel-energy sources such as coal mines or accelerate renewable-energy construction.
Developing countries have demanded $1.3 trillion in annual funding by 2030 from wealthier countries to finance their energy transition and help them adapt to the effects of climate change. Wealthier nations have so far fallen short of their smaller pledge to deliver $100 billion a year in funding.
"No government in the world has enough money to affect the transition," Mr. Kerry said. "The entity that could help the most is the private sector with the right structure."
The plan aims to allow money to flow to emissions-reduction efforts for entire regions in the developing world. That would address one of the weaknesses under the current system, which grants credits for building individual renewable-energy projects but doesn't ensure there are net emissions reductions happening across a broader area.
Most carbon credits on the market today are linked to the construction of individual wind, solar or other renewable projects. That renewable-energy generation could lead to the retirement of a coal-burning plant in one area of a developing country but doesn't stop the country from bringing new coal-burning plants online elsewhere that would outweigh the emissions reductions from a single renewable project.
As world leaders converged on Sharm El Sheikh on Monday at the outset of two weeks of climate talks, the globe's biggest emitters, China and the U.S., have come under pressure to do more to help developing countries with their energy transition.
"The U.S. and China must really step up to the mark," French President Emmanuel Macron said on the sidelines of the conference, calling on "rich non-European countries . . . to pay their share."
Leaders at the summit -- known as COP27 -- face the challenge of building consensus amid geopolitical tension and energy-market turmoil. Russia's decision to invade Ukraine and cut the flow of natural gas to Europe has forced capitals worldwide to focus on the security of their energy supplies. Europe is burning more coal and sucking up supplies of liquefied-natural gas from around the globe.
"Russia's invasion of Ukraine and contemptible manipulation of energy prices has only reinforced the importance of ending our dependence on fossil fuels," said U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
Delegates from more than 190 nations will wrestle with how to get nations to implement their existing pledges to reduce carbon emissions in accordance with promises they made at the 2015 Paris summit. Absent from the gathering are the leaders of China and Russia, countries that have a pivotal role in shaping the global energy map.
President Biden is slated to join the talks later this week.
The talks also will tackle the complicated issue of whether industrialized countries should financially compensate nations are most affected by severe flooding, drought and storms that scientists say are made worse by the effects of climate change. On Monday, delegates agreed that diplomats would officially debate the issue, known as "loss and damage."
The U.S. is also expected to release a long-awaited proposal to curb emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps 85 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.
The U.S. official said the amount of money raised under the proposed program would depend on the level of participation by companies and governments, adding that the program will be voluntary.
The voluntary market for carbon credits has no formal system for regulation, and credits produced for voluntary use are largely incompatible with regulated systems established by governments in Europe, California and other regions where polluters can buy credits if they exceed pollution limits.

Full text: GARDI SUGDUB, Panama -- From this tiny, hot and overcrowded island, some 1,200 indigenous Guna people will soon embark on a short but historic exodus.
Next year, most inhabitants of Gardi Sugdub -- the name means Crab Island -- will leave the cluster of thatched and tin-roofed house where they have lived for more than a century, and head for the Panamanian mainland about a mile away.
These indigenous people will become the first residents in Latin America to be moved pre-emptively by their government from an island whose fate scientists say is to be swallowed by the sea in coming decades due to rising tides caused by climate change.
"When the tide goes up, the water enters some houses and the people have to move their belongings to higher ground," said Pragnaben Mohan, who teaches computer science at the grade school on the island. The water reaches one of the school's classrooms, so that teachers and students must use rubber boots to get in, she said.
The move is scheduled for late next year. On terra firma, they will exchange their island homes of reed walls and sand floors for modern two-bedroom prefab houses in a new neighborhood of some 300 homes called La Barriada.
Gardi Sugdub is one of 365 islands in the San Blas archipelago, about 39 of which are settled by about 30,000 Guna, members of a fiercely independent people who arrived on the islands more than a century and a half ago from the Colombian and Panamanian mainland, fleeing malaria and yellow fever, according to historians. There are 10 more Guna villages on the mainland.
In the archipelago, sea-level rise has accelerated from about 1 millimeter a year in the 1960s to about 3.5 millimeters annually at present, according to tide-gauge data from the Panama Canal Authority and satellite data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Sooner or later, most of the San Blas Islands will be uninhabitable, said Steven Paton, the director of the physical monitoring program at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, a Panama branch of the Washington, D.C.-based Smithsonian Institution.
"Based on current sea-level rise predictions, it is almost certain that within the next 20 years the Guna will have to start leaving these islands and by the end of the century, most will probably have to be abandoned," Mr. Paton said.
The Guna of San Blas have a place to go. They own land on a coastal strip along Panama's coast where the new village is being built with an $850,000 grant from the Inter-American Development Bank and money from Panama's government, a total cost of about $13 million.
Over the decades, the Guna dredged the coral reefs around Gardi Sugdub and other islands, enlarging the size of the islands' land mass with coral landfill and building additional homes. But in expanding the islands, they have weakened their defense against rising tides. The coral reef around the islands had been the main natural protection against storm surges, flooding and erosion.
The move to the mainland isn't very popular among the island's older residents, such as the island's saila, or chief, 82-year-old Jose Davis. Many fear it will lead to the loss of their traditional culture, said Jose Batista, Panama's deputy housing minister.
Mr. Davis, for one, said he isn't going anywhere. "The saila will always be in command here," he said through an interpreter.
"This is an experiment that we are doing," said Mr. Batista. "We could build the houses, and it could turn into a ghost town if the Guna decide to return to the islands."

Full text: The last eight years have each been warmer than all years before that period on record, according to a report by the World Meteorological Organization that was released Sunday as the United Nations opened two weeks of climate talks.
The WMO, which is a branch of the U.N., combined multiple scientific studies to compare temperatures since record-keeping began in the late 19th century. The group also reported that the rate of sea-level rise has doubled since satellite measurements began in 1993. European glaciers are expected to suffer a record melt in 2022. Greenland experienced rainfall, rather than snow, for the first time in September.
Melting glaciers and warming water, which expands in volume, have combined to push sea levels higher by 0.4 inch since 2020, according to the organization. Higher seas are causing coastal flooding and greater storm surges and forcing some residents of low-lying islands to relocate, the WMO said in the report.
The report was released to coincide with the annual U.N. climate summit. Representatives of more than 190 nations are gathering in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El Sheikh for two weeks of talks that have been reshaped by the war in Ukraine and Europe's energy crisis. Russia's decision to cut the flow of natural gas to Europe has forced many countries to burn more coal, boosting their emissions.
"Wars will end. Inflation, cost of living, and the energy crisis will come to an end," said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the U.N. body that oversees climate agreements. "Climate change will only get worse."
The summit, known as the 27th Conference of the Parties, or COP27, will also host leaders of 125 nations Monday and Tuesday. President Biden is scheduled to address the conference Friday.
The push to require industrialized countries to compensate developing nations for what they say are climate-related losses was added Sunday to the official agenda of COP27. The U.S. and European nations are concerned the concept of "loss and damage" will put them on the hook for spiraling liabilities.
The WMO's State of the Global Climate report found that concentrations of the three main greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide -- reached record highs in 2021. These compounds trap solar radiation and warm the Earth's surface. Higher temperatures are linked to more and increasingly severe droughts, intense rainfall, floods and storms, according to climate scientists working for the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
In the summer of 2022, the Northern Hemisphere had record-breaking heat waves and drought that dried up vital river transportation routes, snarled supply chains and drove up the prices of food and energy from the U.S. to China.
One of the most contentious issues at the U.N. conference will be how to address and pay for extreme weather events, particularly in the developing world.
On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is expected to announce details of a climate early warning system for developing nations that could be ready in the next five years.

Full text: Last year's United Nations climate conference in Glasgow was full of disagreements, but it may be a high-water mark for international cooperation on the issue.
This year, an energy crunch underscored the challenges of a transition to clean energy from fossil fuels. Climate concerns are being overshadowed by the war in Ukraine and related energy shortages; governments are worried about an economic downturn and some key alliances have broken down.
Taking place in the Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm El Sheikh, the conference known as COP27 is the 27th U.N. climate gathering and the successor to last year's big event in Glasgow.
Weighing on every part of the conference is Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which upended global energy markets and increased the use of fossil fuels, including coal. It also made the case for energy security, which for many countries means renewables.
Few believed the transition away from fossil fuels would be easy, smooth or cheap. Russia's invasion of Ukraine made it clear how tough it would be. When Russia cut off gas to Europe, it reversed the long-term decline in coal use. Coal is also rising in countries where demand for power is growing.

Full text: Geopolitical strife and energy market turmoil have upended prospects for reaching a global agreement to accelerate efforts to limit climate change, with many big economies failing to submit faster timetables for emissions reductions ahead of next week's United Nations summit.
With only days to go before world leaders and negotiators convene in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El Sheikh for COP27, few countries have followed through on the sweeping agreement struck at last year's conference in Glasgow. That accord urged national governments to submit more ambitious plans to the U.N. by the end of this year to wean their economies off fossil fuels and take other measures aimed at limiting global warming.
"It has been a fairly hostile, complicated global environment in which we're working," said U.S. climate envoy John Kerry.
The absence of tougher emissions targets is a setback in the decadeslong effort, established under the 2015 Paris climate accord, to limit global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius since the preindustrial era and preferably to 1.5 degrees. National governments agreed in Paris to release increasingly ambitious plans for slashing emissions every five years. In Glasgow, however, governments agreed that timetable was too slow, and current plans put the world on track for 2.5 degrees of warming, according to the U.N.
The summit in Sharm El Sheikh will be a test of whether climate diplomacy can shape the long-term trajectory of global emissions in a time of international upheaval. Many of the world's biggest companies, including energy firms and technology giants, aren't sending their top executives to Egypt.
The world's energy map has been redrawn since last year's summit. Russia's decision to invade Ukraine and cut the flow of natural gas to Europe has forced capitals across the world to focus on securing energy supplies.
Europe is now burning more coal and sucking up global supplies of liquefied natural gas to make up for the lost Russian supply, while higher gas prices are pushing some developing countries to rely more on readily available coal as well. Carbon-dioxide emissions across the European Union rose 4.2% in the first nine months of this year compared with the year-earlier period, according to the data analysis site Carbon Monitor.
"The Ukraine war and the consequent gas crisis has wiped out everything," said former Italian Environment Minister Roberto Cingolani, who helped lead climate talks going into Glasgow.
Years of climate talks between China and the U.S., the second-biggest emitter, have broken down amid tensions over Taiwan. China, by far the world's biggest emitter, has refused to update its emissions plan. Beijing wants to focus on hitting current targets, which call for its carbon-dioxide emissions to stop rising before 2030.
"We believe that empty slogans aren't ambitions, and only real ambitions can be demonstrated by implementing goals," Li Gao, director of the climate change department at China's Ministry of Environment and Ecology, said at a recent news conference.
Energy market turmoil has the potential to speed the longer-term transition to cleaner technologies, analysts have said. Surging fossil fuel prices have pushed some of the world's major economies to increase investment in low-carbon energy in the name of national security.
China is installing renewables on a massive scale, positioning Beijing to hit its 2030 target of 1,200 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity five years early. Europe has raised its renewable energy targets as part of a race to wean itself off Russian gas, and the U.S. this summer passed legislation that provides $385 billion over the next decade to fight climate change.
The International Energy Agency last week said the Ukraine war has accelerated the shift to renewable energy and that global fossil-fuel demand would start falling later this decade if governments make good on new policy goals they have unveiled during the crisis.
The Glasgow summit in November 2021 yielded several deals that Western officials hailed as a breakthrough. Governments agreed to phase down coal burning that didn't also capture the carbon-dioxide emissions for storage. They also agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies deemed to be inefficient. It was the first time that a U.N. climate agreement mentioned fossil fuels, ending a long-running concession to big producers such as Saudi Arabia.

Full text: As he cruises toward re-election Tuesday, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has spent much of his time and campaign money picking fights with Republicans in other states, including running ads in Texas and Florida criticizing their GOP governors.
But in Sacramento,where Democrats dominate the state Legislature and have perennial ambitions to push first-in-the nation policies on everything from climate change to technology regulation, Mr. Newsom has regularly clashed with the most progressive elements of his own party.
He has worked behind the scenes to soften legislation and policies he thinks would take California too far to the left and potentially undermine the vision he is pushing on the national stage, according to current and former staffers, legislators, and others who have worked with the governor.
Mr. Newsom has publicly urged voters to approve an initiative on Tuesday's ballot to amend the state constitution to guarantee abortion rights. During negotiations when it was being written, however, his staff pushed legislators to limit the amendment to specifically exclude abortions past the point of fetal viability, people familiar with the talks said. Antiabortion advocates have frequently criticized terminations of pregnancies after that point, which they call late-term abortions.
That effort failed, but other attempts by Mr. Newsom to limit or reject progressive policy proposals were more successful. He scaled back a new labor law for fast-food workers and tied a package of climate bills to a longer life for a nuclear-power plant, people involved in those discussions said.
He also vetoed a bill to legalize sites where people could use illicit drugs under medical supervision.
Mr. Newsom declined requests to be interviewed.
His ads in Florida and Texas, paid for with re-election funds, criticized Republican governors Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott over education and gun control. His campaign also rented billboards in seven GOP-led states, including Ohio and South Carolina, reading, "Need an abortion? California is ready to help."
People who have worked with Mr. Newsom, who was first elected governor in 2018, said the advertisements are part of a broader effort to cast himself as a national champion for Democrats, many of whom he thinks are eager for more aggressive leadership.
But the people said Mr. Newsom thinks his efforts would be damaged if California policies play into perceptions of the state as a place where late-term abortions could be legal, people openly use drugs on the street or the lights regularly go out.
Mr. Newsom "likes political theater, not just as an end in itself but because he believes it's effective to make change," said Ann O'Leary, his former chief of staff who left in January 2021.
Progressives said the disputes in Sacramento are evidence that Mr. Newsom's political showmanship isn't always matched by courage on the issues that matter most to them. "He is doing everything he can to maintain his stature as a progressive leader while still maintaining friends in business," said Lorena Gonzalez, a former Democratic legislator who now heads the California Labor Federation, an umbrella group for state unions. "But that's just politics."
Republicans accuse Mr. Newsom of grandstanding without effectively addressing the state's problems, including homelessness, wildfires and a high cost of living. Last month, his GOP opponent in the governor's race, state Sen. Brian Dahle,opened their first and only debate by sarcastically thanking Mr. Newsom for taking time away from "his dream of being president of the United States."
Mr. Newsom, 55 years old, has said he has "subzero" interest in running for president, a phrase he jokes he can now say in five languages.
Nonetheless, people close to him said Mr. Newsom worries intensely about how he appears in public, down to what signal rolled-up shirt sleeves or an unbuttoned collar might send.
Legislators said they are more likely to hear from him with thanks for kind words said on cable TV than about a family member or a recent illness.
His increased engagement in national politics began at the start of the pandemic, when he ordered some of the strictest shutdowns in the nation. Criticism at that time put Mr. Newsom on defense and prompted him to take shots at GOP governors such as Mr. DeSantis for reopening businesses and schools faster than California. Mr. DeSantis has said some of the worst-case scenarios predicted during the pandemic never came to pass in Florida and that his policies kept his state's economy healthy.
Mr. Newsom's biggest political battle came last year, when Republicans gathered enough signatures to force a recall vote. Political analysts credit Mr. Newsom's 62%-38% defeat of the recall to his strategy of deflecting criticism of his own record and casting his lead opponent, radio host Larry Elder, as a right-winger aligned with former President Donald Trump.
The people close to Mr. Newsom said that experience informed his approach this year as he runs for re-election against Mr. Dahle, a little-known legislator who has raised a fraction of the governor's campaign funds. While many Democratic incumbents in the country face tight re-election races this year, Mr. Newsom has maintained a double-digit lead in polls.
With $22.9 million in campaign funds, he began running TV ads out-of-state months before airing any in California's general election and unsuccessfully challenged Mr. DeSantis to a debate before agreeing to his first and only one with Mr. Dahle.
Beyond bashing Republicans, Mr. Newsom has also used his rising national profile to tout California as a leader on issues such as climate change and gun control.
"The future happens in California first," he often says.
Conservatives counter by pointing out the state's widespreadstreet homelessness, declining population and that companies including Tesla Inc., and Oracle Corp. have moved operations out of state.

Full text: More communities in California wine country are telling gasoline stations to set up shop somewhere else.
Eight cities and towns in Napa and Sonoma counties have banned the construction of new gas stations. The city council in Novato, Calif., located in Marin County, passed a ban in an initial vote last week and is expected to give it final approval in November.
Local leaders say the laws are part of an effort to fight climate change in a region that has been devastated by wildfires and drought.
They also say there is increasingly less need for gas stations in the area, as state data show electric vehicles are more common in Marin, Napa and Sonoma than the nation at large.
Opponents say the bans will raise prices and force residents to drive farther for gas, and that new stations could also charge electric vehicles.
Fueled in part by state regulations that require an end to the sale of gasoline-powered cars in California in 2035, anti-gas-station activists are fighting for more prohibitions on new construction in the state, including in Los Angeles.
The prohibitions have so far faced little political opposition in small municipalities or large ones such as Santa Rosa, a city of 177,000 an hour north of San Francisco that lost 3,000 homes in a 2017 wildfire.
Santa Rosa passed the legislation in August with a unanimous vote by the city council, which included five Democrats and two former Republicans who no longer affiliate with either party.
"We are a community that has felt the sting of climate change," said Chris Rogers, the city's mayor. "We don't want to use our land, which is very valuable, and our staff time, which is also very valuable, on the infrastructure of the past."
Mr. Rogers, a Democrat who shares an electric Mini Cooper with his wife, said 41 gas stations are sufficient for his 42-square-mile city.
But some wine-country residents say they fear that limiting new gas stations would cause prices to rise. The average price for a gallon of gas in Sonoma County was $5.73 as of Oct. 28, almost $2 higher than the national average, according to AAA.
"They'll ban this . . . and then they'll be [upset] that it goes up to $12 a gallon," said Donn Dabney, owner of Left Coast Classics, a classic-car dealership in Sonoma, Calif.
Mr. Dabney said that because of his line of work, he owns nine gasoline-powered cars, including a 1972 Cadillac Coupe DeVille and a 1993 Alfa Romeo Spider Veloce.
As the push for such bans has expanded to less-affluent communities such as Cloverdale, a city of 9,000 at the northern edge of Sonoma County, some local leaders are trying to stop them. Mayor Todd Lands, a Republican, said his constituents can't afford Teslas.
"I'm the mayor of our city, I run our city and I can't afford an electric vehicle," said Mr. Lands, who owns a construction company and drives a Chevy pickup truck.
Even so, Mr. Lands said he expects the ban to pass in Cloverdale, which currently has six gas stations.
The California Fuels and Convenience Alliance, an association representing gas-station owners, is fighting the proposals. It has argued that gas stations can install and subsidize electric-vehicle chargers. The association also said bans would force people to drive farther to get gasoline, leading to more pollution.
Advocates of the bans say electric-vehicle charging is best done at home, work or while shopping.
The push began after a group of environmentalists came together in 2019 to block a new gas station in Sonoma County and discovered that plans were under way for more to open in the area.
"We were surprised that anyone was still building them," said Woody Hastings, co-coordinator of the Coalition Opposing New Gas Stations.
Mr. Hastings, energy program manager at the Climate Center, a nonprofit that works to reduce pollution that worsens climate change, said he drives a 2013 electric Chevrolet Volt.
"A lot of people say, 'What are you doing? We can't afford a Tesla,'" said Mr. Hastings. "I can't afford a Tesla either."
The movement likely faces a tougher fight in Los Angeles, a city of some four million people where 93% of households have a motor vehicle, according to the U.S. Census. A bill asking the city attorney to draft an ordinance banning new gas stations is making its way through committee hearings. Its author, Democrat Paul Koretz, said he plans to put the bill up for a full city-council vote.

Full text: An uprising by banks in a United Nations-sponsored climate coalition has been quelled but opened wounds that could weaken an alliance meant to funnel trillions of dollars to fund the transition away from fossil fuels.
Getting banks to sign on to the coalition was a marquee achievement of the U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. Since then, fuel shortages and pressure from politicians and regulators led banks to push back against what they thought were tighter rules.
Some banks regret joining the group, known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, people familiar with the matter said. The U.N. body will likely survive, but its impact could be limited.
"Gfanz is no longer in control," said Margaret Peloso, a partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP who advises Wall Street firms on climate strategy but not on issues involving the group. "I don't think they have any authority left."
Banks and other businesses, under pressure from customers and investors to address climate change, have made commitments to reduce their funding and usage of fossil fuels and offset what they can't eliminate. Ahead of the climate conference in Glasgow last November, banks and investors signed up for the U.N. group.
Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine highlighted the world's dependence on fossil fuels, banks said they couldn't reduce funding for producers as quickly as climate advocates wanted. That belief fueled tension within the bank group in recent weeks.
Lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. threatened to exit after the U.N. published language recommending they restrict funding for fossil-fuel companies and end financing for new coal projects, people familiar with the matter said.
The threat was averted last week when the head of the group reminded them that the U.N. groups can't unilaterally set criteria for the lenders.
They are worried about complying with U.S. banking regulations and face political pressure from Republican officials about their use of environmental and other criteria in their business decisions.
The group's organizers, other members and environmentalists are frustrated that the U.N. coalition appears to be another voluntary climate group with little muscle to force the changes needed to slow global warming.
"Gfanz needs to answer the question: 'What is it for and what is it trying to achieve?'" said Ben Caldecott, director of the University of Oxford's sustainable finance group and an adviser to investors and the U.K. government on climate.
The group's co-chairman and former central banker, Mark Carney, has said that no one told him they thought about leaving. The language in the U.N. guidelines was too strong and needed to be changed, he said. He has defended the group as valuable and told a U.K. Parliament group this week that Gfanz has grown to more than 500 members with about $150 trillion in assets.
A Gfanz spokeswoman said that the work was always going to be challenging and that the group is working with members to resolve their challenges and meet climate goals.
The alliance is in focus ahead of next month's climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The group was launched in April 2021 to bring together industry alliances for banks, insurers, asset managers and other financial sectors. Last November, it said pledges from members to deliver $100 trillion in private-sector funding by midcentury were "at the scale needed" to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Accord.
Bonds and loans to fund oil-and-gas companies nearly match borrowing for green projects, as they did last year. Scientists say green funding needs to be several times more than fossil-fuel financing to avoid the worst effects of global warming.
Meanwhile, Republicans started criticizing banks for their climate-investing practices and saying they represent divestment from fossil fuels. Attorneys general in several states last week launched an investigation into the banks joining the U.N. industry group.
The dispute between the banks and the U.N. group began this summer when a U.N. body published guidelines for the group's members. These included restricting fossil-fuel financing and ending funding for new coal projects.
Banks objected, saying the language went too far and posed legal risks to them. The U.N. then tweaked the language to recommend practices in line with keeping temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius, as countries agreed to in the Paris agreement. The change was cosmetic because compliance with the Paris deal entails winding down fossil-fuel funding and ending financing for new coal plants.
Several banks threatened to leave unless they got reassurance that the U.N. couldn't set binding criteria on its own, the people said. The banks say they remain committed to their climate pledges and will publish progress reports. The head of the banking alliance gave the upset members reassurance in a letter last week.

Full text: The emperor penguin will soon be considered a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said.
The federal agency said Tuesday it had finalized protections for the species, following a proposal last year. It cited the effects of a warming climate on the sea-ice habitat in Antarctica, where emperor penguins spend the majority of their lives, as the "primary threat to the penguin."
"Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the Administration," Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams said in a statement. "The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action."
Emperor penguins are considered a bellwether of any future climate changes in Antarctica because their icy habitat is so sensitive to rising temperatures.
The current emperor penguin population, estimated to be around 625,000-650,000 individual birds or 270,000-280,000 breeding pairs, appears stable at the moment, according to Fish and Wildlife Service officials. But, they added, "the species is in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future in a significant portion of its range."
By 2050, the population is estimated to decrease by 26% to 47%, depending on the level of carbon emissions, Fish and Wildlife Service officials said.
"While this estimated decline is concerning, listing the emperor penguin as threatened under the ESA comes while there is still time to prevent the species from extinction," the Fish and Wildlife Service said.
The agency's final rule listing the species as threatened will publish Wednesday and go into effect 30 days later.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 can provide benefits to an animal even if it doesn't exist within U.S. borders. The act will usually prohibit the import or export of the animal, as well as its use in interstate commerce and foreign commerce. Listing a species can create increased awareness of the threatened species and provide limited financial assistance to help conservation efforts for species listed in foreign countries.
The emperor penguin is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species, with adults that can weigh up to 88 pounds. The flightless bird relies on sea ice to forage for food, form breeding colonies and avoid predators.

Full text: Why do I want an electric vehicle?
Remember flip phones, fax machines and dial-up modems? You want an electric vehicle because they are generationally improved products: quieter, quicker, more refined, more efficient, offering superior vehicle dynamics, less maintenance and lower per-mile operating costs. For the millions of American commuters able to charge at home, overnight, EVs will be cheaper and more convenient. For them, recharging could take seconds a week, the time it takes to plug in before you go in the house at night. For them per-mile costs will be measured in pennies, not quarters. In one survey, four out of five new-car buyers can charge at home. You want one because EVs are better for the environment. According to the U.S. EPA, the average EV produces about two-thirds fewer emissions than an IC car in a well-to-wheel analysis, which counts emissions from producing/delivering either fuel or electricity. On a life-cycle basis -- including end of use -- an EV's total emissions are less than half that of a comparable gas-powered vehicle. You want one because the preponderance of the auto industry's genius is laser-focused on making EVs progressively more awesome while combustion technology is about as good as it will ever get. If you say it's good enough, I have a question for you: What are you smoking?
What's wrong with internal combustion?
Besides tailpipe poisons, costlier service and maintenance and our geopolitical adversaries' manipulation of the price of oil? Three words: continuously variable transmission. The dreaded CVT is emblematic of the throttling necessary to get the next generation of ICs past global markets' emission standards. Compared to EVs' few moving parts, the complexity of modern gas-powered vehicles terrifies me: ten-speed transmissions; variable geometry turbochargers; high-pressure injectors; high-voltage hybrid systems relying on dozens of sensors and fistfuls of CPUs. Ten years from now, what condition will these smoke-making spaceships be in? Who will fix them, code them?
I do want an EV, but shouldn't I wait?
I estimate two out of three reader inquiries reflect this eager-but-skeptical mind-set, from people postponing purchase of an EV for reasons of cost, practicality or a lack of desirable models. The biggest barrier to widespread adoption is not charging but affordability: Legacy auto makers have so far priced EVs like premium upgrades to existing products. Example: The Volvo XC40 Recharge ($53,550 MSRP) is about $6,000 more than a fully loaded XC40 B5. The rationale is that the bump in price reflects the high cost of batteries and premium content. That dynamic stands to swing the other way as the average cost of building EVs falls below that of comparable ICs due to the plummeting cost of batteries. Some analysts have pegged this industry inflection point (around $100 per kilowatt-hour) as soon as 2024. I actually expect a bit of a price war in mid-decade, as EVs from China and South Korea recalibrate the U.S. market's affordability.
Are the batteries ready?
Barely. The best commercial batteries today store less than 300 Wh per kg, a pitiful fraction of gasoline's energy density. These little guys cost a fortune, weigh a ton and they use a lot of unsustainable materials, such as cobalt. Energy density -- the kWh per kg, not how fast you can go on a charge but how far -- remains the biggest challenge. You can toot around in an unburdened Ford F-150 Lightning for 200 miles between charges, easy. But hook a boat and trailer to it, and the pickup's range falls off the proverbial cliff. In frigid temperatures an EV's estimated range might fall on the order of 30-40%. When plugged in overnight, EVs' batteries are kept warm, but they do not like a cold soak.
What if I want a Tesla?
Pull the trigger. The cars are awesome. Thanks to the company's ever-growing network of fast-charging stations you can go where you like and live where you like. It certainly helps that long-range Teslas can go more than 300 miles between charges and recuperate 162 miles in 15 minutes. In a word, practical.
What if I don't want a Tesla?
I get that. After all, Tesla makes only four body styles. But you are giving up the Supercharger safety net.
Do the batteries pose a fire hazard?
It's not zero, but the possibility of your EV's battery catching fire as the result of a collision is remote, comparable to the risk in an IC-powered car. The other spooky possibility is a "cascading thermal event," as battery engineers call it, in use or while recharging. The Chevy Bolt case is a recent example. Comparisons are not perfect: Battery fires have been typically traced to a manufacturing defect, for which a recall or even do-not-drive order is sent out en masse. Fires involving IC-powered vehicles are stochastic and situational.
Will I ever have to replace the battery?
Highly unlikely. In California, EV and hybrid batteries must be warrantied for 10 years or 150,000 miles (the federal standard is eight years and 100,000 miles). In the field, the first generation of EV batteries has lived longer and worked harder than most were expecting. Tesla and others are aiming for the million-mile battery.
Are EVs better for the environment?
In terms of one's personal carbon footprint, don't kid yourself: The best kind of car is no car. That said, EV lifetime emissions pencil out to be about half of their average IC counterparts, according to a U.S. EPA analysis. While EVs are more carbon-intensive to make, due to mining and battery manufacture, they quickly recoup the difference in use, where they are two-thirds cleaner, well to wheel. As for the oft-quoted fear of used batteries gathering in landfills, that isn't happening. Out of necessity, auto makers are building closed-loop, whole-vehicle recycling systems to recover valuable materials such as nickel, cobalt, copper and aluminum. Some are trying to make them from more common, less expensive materials. The biggest battery-maker in the world, China's CATL, now makes lithium manganese iron phosphate batteries with energy density up 255 Wh/kg, comparable to nickel-cobalt chemistries while being on the order of 20% cheaper.
Do EVs help fight climate change?
They are only as clean as the power sources that charge them. That's to our collective advantage. At the national level, the U.S. has been steadily decarbonizing its electrical generation over some decades. Currently about 25% of U.S. production comes from renewable, carbon-neutral sources -- solar, wind, water -- according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At the current pace, renewables will provide 38% of the nation's energy by 2030. On a nationwide basis, the U.S. doesn't have a generation problem but a distribution problem, due to aging grid infrastructure. The Energy Department estimates the U.S. squandered 14 terawatts of clean power in 2021, left unused in interconnection "queues." In California, where renewables are a big part of generating capacity, the average EV produces about 2,261 pounds of emissions every year; in West Virginia, where utilities rely heavily on coal, the same EV produces 9,146 pounds. Not great, but still less than the average gas-powered car (11,400 pounds). For many, the most tantalizing EV talking point is home solar recharging, typically using a bank of batteries to store the sun's energy. This is as close to zero per-mile emissions you can get. Tesla has a home energy ecosystem built around photovoltaic roof tiles and its Powerwall storage unit. Other auto makers are following.
What about plug-in hybrids?
I'm not a fan, except in Ferraris. Designed to operate for short distances in EV mode and then, as necessary, engage the gas engine, PHEVs were intended to be transitional products, literally bridging the distance between gas and electric range. In practice, PHEVs often serve power and performance, not efficiency. Some PHEVs can't go 10 miles on electrons alone. The other issue is psychological. Studies show that PHEV users don't plug them in very often, or at all. This negates the public good for which PHEV tax credits were awarded. Meanwhile, PHEVs have the same maintenance needs as conventional IC cars.
So is now a good time to buy an EV?
Not really, no. Consumer demand -- nationally and globally -- has run well ahead of auto makers' plans, leaving them scrambling to add capacity. Example: Ford more than doubled production targets for F-150 Lightning pickups at Dearborn's Rouge Electric Vehicle Center since the facility came online earlier this year. The company closed out reservations last year after the list hit 200,000. The shortage of inventory is multicausal -- chips, Covid, shipping and logistics. These have coincided with the macroeconomics of EV disruption, what marketers call the "gooseneck of demand." The consequence has been rising prices, including tacked-on "market adjustments" from sharp-elbowed dealers. My advice: Don't pay them.
---
Is the Current Network of Charging Stations Adequate?
Anyone considering buying an EV will first want to know where to charge it. For most -- about 80% of buyers in the U.S. in 2021 -- the answer is at home, typically overnight, or at a workplace garage. Anyone charging at home should use EV-rated equipment, professionally installed.
For those without such access -- renters, city dwellers, students -- going electric is not simply a question of where to charge, but for how long and at what cost? Anyone running those numbers is likely to come up with Tesla, which has 35,000 Superchargers worldwide. But outside of Tesla's orbit, the state of fast charging is woefully inadequate -- a mixed bag of 6,000 stations, with varying standards and charging speeds.
The big reset comes with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, which provides $7.5 billion for EV charging infrastructure, most of it channeled through state DOTs. These initiatives include funding for Alternative Fuel Corridors, including most interstate highways, with DC direct charging stations spaced every 50 miles or so and within a mile of the highway, terrain allowing. The goal is 500,000 charging stations nationwide by 2030, about a fivefold increase.
The other speed check on the road to electrification is the rate at which a vehicle can be safely recharged. Most EV systems use a 400V architecture, including Tesla. Others, including Hyundai and BMW, are transitioning to 800V battery systems -- nominally two times quicker to recharge. Plugged up to the right charger, some EVs on the market today can gain 150 miles of range in 10 minutes.

Which Newer All-Electric Cars Are Worth a Look?
From sporty to practical, six able EVs on the market now -- or coming soon
Tesla Roadster Price $250,000 (est.) Range 620 miles (est.) Charging Up to 250 kW (est.) The long-awaited, oft-delayed Tesla Roadster is expected sometime next year, trailing clouds of superlative numbers: 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and 250+ mph top speed. It costs $50,000 just to reserve one.
Hyundai IONIQ 6 Price $45,000 (est.) Range 300 miles (est.) Charging 10%-80% in 18 mins Arriving in 2023, the Hyundai IONIQ 6 is a sleek, bobbed-tailed four-door coupe, a style-forward addition to the brand's EV lineup, offering extra-fast charging.
Chevrolet Silverado EV RST Price $105,000 Range Up to 400 miles Charging Up to 350 kW
Chevy's first EV pickup will go on sale in fall 2023. The First Edition models supply 754 hp and 785 lb-ft of torque to four-wheel drive, with 10,000-pound max. trailering capacity.
VW ID. Buzz Price $60,000 (est.) Range 264 miles Charging 5%-80% in 30 mins
Volkswagen's ID. Buzz plays the nostalgia card, with retro-futurist styling reminiscent of VW's Kombi vans of the 1960s.
Subaru Solterra Price $44,995 Range 228 miles Charging 20%-80% in 60 mins
Co-developed by Toyota and Subaru, the Solterra is the platform cousin of Toyota's bZ4X. The Subaru comes with dual-motor all-wheel drive as standard equipment.
Kia Niro EV Price Pending Range 253 miles Charging 10-80% in less than 45 mins
The second generation of Kia's amiable urban runabout comes in hybrid, plug-in hybrid or pure EV version, featuring a 201-hp motor in front and a 64.8-kWh battery.

Full text: Exxon Mobil Corp. hopes an outsider who most recently headed General Motors Co.'s driverless-car unit can shake up its efforts to build a climate-friendly business unit.
The oil giant recently tapped Dan Ammann, a former investment banker and longtime GM executive, to lead its fledgling low-carbon business. Mr. Ammann's task is daunting: turn a new unit intended to cut carbon emissions into a profit center.
The selection is an unusual choice for the company, known for a conservative culture that prizes hiring employees out of school and typically promoting senior leadership from within its ranks. Mr. Ammann, a New Zealand native, never worked for an oil company before joining Exxon this summer. He was once a contender to become GM's chief executive and later clashed with current CEO Mary Barra, said people familiar with the matter.
At Exxon, Mr. Ammann says he will attempt to run the new unit like a startup within a storied oil-and-gas company that possesses vast resources and engineering prowess. "In many ways, we're starting with a blank sheet of paper," Mr. Ammann said, "but with this incredible set of capabilities."
The venture, created in February 2021 and dubbed Low Carbon Solutions, is focused on technologies that complement Exxon's fossil-fuel business by cutting emissions associated with them. The technologies include capturing carbon emissions from industrial sites and storing them underground. The economics of many of the technologies are unproven, and carbon-capture projects have a high failure rate globally because of technological problems.
A big part of the job is figuring out a workable business model for the unit, said Mr. Ammann, 50 years old. Exxon has for years used technologies such as carbon capture to cut emissions from its operations, but it plans to offer those as a service to other companies. "If you want to actually have a measurable impact to something as massive as climate change, you have to have a vision to build a business; that's actually really enormous," Mr. Ammann said.
The unit on Wednesday announced its first commercial deal under Mr. Ammann, an agreement with ammonia producer CF Industries Holdings Inc. Exxon will transport and permanently store carbon dioxide captured at a CF Industries manufacturing site in southeastern Louisiana. Exxon said it would sequester up to 2 million metric tons of emissions annually from 2025, pumping the carbon underground at a site it owns in Vermilion Parish. Exxon didn't disclose the financial terms of the agreement.
Exxon established the low-carbon unit last year as investors pressed the company to gear up for a shift in global energy demand toward cleaner resources and months before it lost a proxy battle to hedge fund Engine No. 1. During one of the most expensive activist campaigns ever, the fund argued Exxon didn't have a viable business plan for the transition.
Exxon has vowed to spend $15 billion through 2027 curbing its emissions and helping other companies do the same. It has said its low-carbon investments will generate returns over 10%. Some critics say the industry's recent initiatives primarily serve to prolong the lifespan of its oil-and-gas assets by reducing their carbon footprint. Others accuse Exxon of greenwashing -- only paying lip-service to climate-change solutions to protect its public image.
Mr. Ammann rejects allegations of greenwashing and said he believes he and his team have the support of Exxon CEO Darren Woods and other leaders. "I wouldn't be here if I didn't think we were extremely serious about what we're doing," he said.
As the chief executive of autonomous-vehicle company Cruise, Mr. Ammann and Ms. Barra disagreed about the direction of Cruise, with Mr. Ammann in favor of at least a partial separation of the company and Ms. Barra looking to keep it in-house longer and integrate it into GM, according to people familiar with the matter. That disagreement contributed to his departure from GM in December 2021, the people said. Mr. Ammann declined to comment.
At Exxon, Mr. Ammann said he is trying to get his employees comfortable reaching out to other companies despite not knowing exactly how Exxon's capabilities can help potential customers curb emissions. Taking that step is what brought about the agreement with CF Industries and is what it will take to generate more business, he said.
Carbon-capture projects have a poor commercial record. More than 80% of proposed commercial carbon-capture efforts have failed globally, primarily because the technology didn't work as expected or the projects proved too expensive to operate, according to a 2020 study by researchers at Canada's Carleton University, the University of California, San Diego, and elsewhere.
Exxon has begun to build a backlog of projects similar to its CF Industries agreement and expects more projects to become economically viable as technology improves and costs fall over time, Mr. Ammann said.
"You're going to go from an environment where the costs are pretty high and the policy is kind of nascent, where only a very small slice of projects work," he said, into one "where things invert, and you've got higher carbon prices, scaled-up technology and lower costs."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is entering a "decisive decade" as it faces competition with China and an attempt by Russia to upend the international order, while dealing with challenges from climate change to energy to food security, international terrorism and disease, the White House said Wednesday.
The Biden administration released its national-security strategy, a blueprint that outlines the administration's approach to problems around the world. The strategy describes the U.S.'s attempt to compete with its adversaries, such as China and Russia, while cultivating alliances with countries that share American interests and objectives.
"Our strategy proceeds from the premise that two strategic challenges -- geopolitical competition and shared transnational threats -- are intertwined," White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday.
"We cannot build [the] broad coalitions we need to outcompete our rivals if we sideline the issues that most directly impact the lives of billions of people," he said.
The strategy was delayed for months, in part, Mr. Sullivan said, because the analysts needed to factor in lessons from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The strategy, which every administration is required to draft, informs a separate document that has yet to be released from the Pentagon, called the national-defense strategy, which informs budgeting and other plans for the U.S. military.
Mr. Sullivan said that the strategy is consistent with the administration's vision on modernizing the U.S. military and intelligence capabilities, amid the deep investments Beijing has made in its own military.
In addition to pointing to the threats posed by China and Russia, the strategy de-emphasizes threats from terrorism but identifies a number of transnational threats that include food security, disease, pandemics and climate change, he said.
"The national security strategy also recognizes that the climate crisis is the greatest of all the shared threats that we face without immediate global action during this decisive decade," he said.
Previous national security strategy documents defined both China and Russia as global competitors to the U.S., and Moscow's February invasion of Ukraine was a reminder that the threat posed by Russia couldn't be written off. Russia is "still profoundly dangerous," the White House document said.
But the weakening of Russia's military and of its position on the global stage since the invasion and battlefield losses to Ukrainian forces have reinforced the view that China is the U.S.'s most consequential threat.
While Russia is diminishing in strength, the new strategy describes Beijing as the only competitor with the intent to reshape the international order and the increasing economic, diplomatic, military and technological might to do so.
The strategy largely codifies the approach toward Beijing that the Biden administration has pursued since coming into office: Investing more at home to boost American economic and technological competitiveness and relying more on the U.S.'s wide network of alliances to constrain Beijing's room to maneuver.
In a third pillar of that approach, the U.S. will compete responsibly with China to defend American interests, the document states, while seeking to cooperate with Beijing on climate change and recognizing the unease many countries feel at being caught between the U.S. and China.
"We also want to avoid a world in which competition escalates into a world of rigid blocs," the strategy reads. "We do not seek conflict or a new Cold War. Rather, we are trying to support every country, regardless of size or strength, in exercising the freedom to make choices that serve their interests."
Mr. Biden in discussions with Chinese leader Xi Jinping has outlined the U.S. call for cooperation and the need to put limits on competition to prevent a new Cold War. Beijing and Mr. Xi often have responded coolly to these overtures, saying U.S. actions don't match Mr. Biden's words.
The strategy's offer to work with all countries and not treat them as pawns in great-power competition comes as the U.S. is trying to recover influence among developing nations. Some have at times complained that they are being driven into Beijing's and Moscow's embrace by the U.S.'s use of economic sanctions and its positions on human rights and environmental protection.

Full text: BlackRock Inc.'s ESG balancing act is getting harder.
The world's largest investor is taking heat from government officials on both sides of the climate debate -- and the talk is turning into action.
Louisiana's treasurer last week said the state would pull nearly $800 million from BlackRock funds by the end of the year, citing the asset manager's support for environmental, social and governance investing.
The move came just a few weeks after BlackRock got a flurry of letters calling out its stance on climate issues. In August, attorneys general from 19 states accused BlackRock of actively pressuring companies to phase out fossil fuels to the detriment of the states that depend on the oil-and-gas industry. The following month, New York City's comptroller suggested BlackRock is walking back its climate promises.
So far, BlackRock hasn't taken much of a financial hit for its moves in either direction; $800 million is a minuscule slice of the $8.5 trillion that the company manages for investors. Still, the letter-writing campaign has put the asset manager in the tricky position of having to defend its climate bona fides while highlighting its investments in energy companies.
BlackRock launched a website last week that attempts to do just that. "We're setting the record straight about our focus on energy investing, our responsibilities to clients and how we consider climate risk," it reads. "We DO NOT boycott the energy industry."
"The fact of the matter is, we recognize there's politicization and using BlackRock as the punching bag is convenient for politics at the moment," Mark McCombe, BlackRock's chief client officer, said in an interview. "But we're going to do what we've always done, which is deliver for our clients."
To be sure, dispatches from dissatisfied officials have become almost routine for BlackRock since Chief Executive Larry Fink, in his 2020 annual letter to CEOs, wrote that the asset manager would "place sustainability at the center of our investment approach."
Still, the backlash put the company on defense. BlackRock began publicly highlighting its investments in energy companies. It supported fewer climate-related shareholder proposals in the 2022 proxy-voting season, calling them "more prescriptive" than in years past.
The moves have drawn complaints from officials on the other side of the debate.
"BlackRock is our biggest asset manager, and we've been seeing the evolution of BlackRock's rhetoric around climate shifting, which was very concerning to us," Louise Yeung, chief climate officer for New York City's comptroller, said. "It made us wonder whether their climate commitments were hollow. We can't meet our goals as a pension system without our asset managers in alignment with us."
Mr. McCombe said BlackRock invests in energy companies because they are well-positioned to help understand and solve the issue of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. "We haven't walked anything back," he said. "We are clarifying."
Much of the criticism stems from BlackRock's influence over a vast swath of American companies. The firm owns stakes in more than 14,000 companies in the U.S. and other countries and casts votes on proxy proposals on behalf of millions of passive investors.
BlackRock has said it doesn't dictate emissions targets for the companies in which it invests. "We are disturbed by the emerging trend of political initiatives that sacrifice pension plans' access to high-quality investments -- and thereby jeopardize pensioners' financial returns," BlackRock wrote in a letter responding to the 19 state attorneys general. It also cited $170 billion invested in U.S. energy companies as proof it doesn't boycott fossil fuels.
Lawmakers have considered paths to curb the voting power of large asset managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard Group. A group of Republican senators introduced legislation in May that would seek to curtail the power they have over public companies.

Full text: Regulators in the U.S. and Europe are trying to tighten rules on popular environmental, social and governance investment products, triggering a backlash from investors and businesses.
ESG funds boomed in recent years, exceeding $350 billion in net assets in 2021 in the U.S., as investors look to fund companies addressing climate change and other issues. But murky disclosures and lax standards are driving regulators to tighten the rules.
Proposed regulations from the Securities and Exchange Commission would establish a common benchmark for how sustainable investment products are labeled, marketed and reported. That could lead to investors pulling cash from funds that don't appear to be taking the standards seriously.
"In the short term, these rules, if adopted, may result in a decrease in total assets invested in funds that purport to be sustainable," Mindy Lubber, chief executive of nonprofit sustainability advocacy group Ceres, wrote in a letter to the SEC. "We believe that ultimately, they would bolster confidence in climate and otherESGinvestment products."
BlackRock Inc. and other investors are urging the SEC to change key provisions of a rule that would require investment advisers and companies to disclose how ESG factors influence investing decisions. In Europe, some ESG data providers rejected calls for regulatory intervention meant to monitor the transparency and comparability of environmental ratings.
ESG definitions vary widely between funds, making it possible for fund managers to exaggerate their consideration of environmental and other criteria in selecting constituents, according to the SEC. Morningstar counted more than 600 funds mentioning ESGi n investor literature before it changed how it tracked such funds in part because blanket sustainability statements are common,it said in a letter to the SEC.
The proposed SEC rules seek to enforce consistency of ESG disclosures by requiring advisers of sustainable funds to describe which factors are considered and in some cases the portfolio's carbon footprint, among other changes. A separate measure to update rules for fund names to ensure they accurately reflect their investments is also being considered.
BlackRock's CEO is an outspoken proponent of climate-friendly policies and the company made socially responsible funds the centerpiece of its $8.5 trillion business. The asset manager is seeking changes to parts of the SEC's proposals to disclose more climate-related details.
It said funds shouldn't have to disclose proprietary ESG data points that BlackRock believes the proposed rules may require. It questioned why regulators raised environmental concerns above other social and governance considerations,according to an August letter.
Many large U.S. investment advisers are subject to European rules,where regulators have some of the most stringent environmental-disclosure policies. Among them is the creation of a single rulebook to cover ESG ratings that would force firms to publish more information about how they score companies.

Full text: CANADA
Hurricane Fiona Set
To Hit Atlantic Coast
Eastern Canada is bracing for what forecasters said could be a once-in-a-lifetime storm.
Hurricane Fiona is set to make landfall there Saturday as it barrels up the Atlantic Ocean, where it has left behind a trail of destruction in parts of the northern Caribbean.
Fiona could bring floods, heavy rain and dangerous winds across eastern Canada, forecasters said. "This could be one of the worst, if not the worst, hurricane they've ever experienced in their lives," said Dan Kottlowski, a senior forecaster and lead hurricane forecaster at AccuWeather Inc.
In a rare occurrence, Fiona was forecast to arrive in eastern Canada even as it was still intensifying, Mr. Kottlowski said. Hurricanes frequently make landfall in the area, he said, but the storms usually weaken by the time they reach land.

PAKISTAN
Climate-Disaster
Relief Funds Sought
After suffering catastrophic floods, Pakistan is leading a push with other developing nations to establish international funding for natural disasters that they say are caused by climate change, in an effort to spur momentum around the issue ahead of climate negotiations later this year.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a speech Friday at the United Nations General Assembly, said that record rainfall that has inundated parts of Pakistan in recent weeks was the result of global warming caused by the emissions of rich countries.
"Nature has unleashed her fury on Pakistan without looking at our carbon footprint, which is next to nothing," Mr. Sharif said. "Our actions did not contribute to this."
Some 1,600 people have been killed, and livelihoods have been swept away, as millions of acres of crops were inundated and a million livestock animals drowned.

IRAN
Protesters Come
Under More Pressure
Iranian security forces have escalated their use of force to suppress a largely peaceful protest movement, moving from nonlethal riot control tactics to firing live rounds, according to rights groups, raising fears of a higher death toll as the unrest spreads.
At the same time, authorities heavily disrupted access to the internet in an attempt to block the social-media networks on which the protesters have relied to express dissent and rally support. On Friday, posts and videos on the protests were down to a trickle.
The death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini late last week in police custody for allegedly violating the country's strict Islamic dress code sparked protests across the country. Iranian authorities warned Friday in the sharpest terms yet that the crackdown could intensify further if the protests continue.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- World Bank President David Malpass said Friday he wasn't resigning from his position amid calls from climate advocates for him to step down over his views on climate change.
Mr. Malpass also said the bank's shareholders -- governments around the world led by the U.S. -- haven't asked him to resign. Mr. Malpass, who was nominated to lead the bank by former President Donald Trump, was speaking in an interview with Politico.
The World Bank chief has been under criticism since Tuesday over his response to questions regarding whether burning of fossil fuels has led to rapid and dangerous global warming. At a New York climate event hosted by the New York Times he declined to directly answer, saying, "I am not a scientist."
He has since sought to clarify his positions. "Look, it's clear that greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity are adding to, are causing, climate change," Mr. Malpass said in the Friday interview.
Mr. Malpass acknowledged that he didn't do his best job in responding to a comment by former Vice President Al Gore who called him a "climate denier" at the Tuesday event.
"When asked 'Are you a climate denier?' I should have said, 'no,'" Mr. Malpass said Friday. The incident was "unfortunate," he said, because the World Bank is taking a forceful leadership position to address climate change.
The president of the U.S., by far the largest shareholder of the World Bank, customarily appoints the chief of the World Bank, a Washington-based lender for developing countries. Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Malpass to a five-year term that ends in 2024.
The Trump administration frequently bucked international efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
"We expect the World Bank Group to be a global leader of climate ambition and the mobilization of significantly more climate finance for developing countries," Treasury Department spokesman Michael Kikukawa said, responding to a question about the U.S.'s position on Mr. Malpass's standing. "We have -- and will continue -- to make that expectation clear to World Bank leadership."
Asked by reporters whether Mr. Malpass had President Biden's support amid calls for his removal, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that "removing him requires a majority of shareholders" and reiterated that the administration would continue to press for the World Bank to address climate change.
"Treasury will hold Malpass accountable to this position and support the many staff working to fight climate change at the World Bank," Ms. Jean-Pierre said.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has met the heads of multilateral financial institutions including the World Bank to press them to increase their climate finance amounts, step up their efforts to assist countries in reducing emissions and better mobilize private capital for climate investments.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) on Wednesday released the full details of his permitting-overhaul bill aimed at speeding up the approval process for energy-related projects across the country.
The 91-page proposal would accelerate timelines for environmental reviews of major energy projects such as pipelines, transmission lines and wind farms. It would set a two-year target for the duration of the most detailed category of review required by the federal National Environmental Policy Act.
The bill includes changes to Clean Water Act provisions that have given states and tribes the power to object to pipelines and other energy projects over pollution concerns, limiting the scope of their veto authority on water-quality issues.
Mr. Manchin has called permitting reform a critical measure to increase U.S. energy independence, fight climate change and lower costs for American households. While summaries of the bill had been circulating throughout Congress in recent weeks, the full text wasn't released until Wednesday evening.
"I've always said the energy we produce in America is cleaner -- and can be even cleaner -- than energy produced around the world," he told reporters Tuesday.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has pledged to include the proposal with a short-term spending package later this month, raising pressure on lawmakers to vote for the permitting language or risk a partial government shutdown. Congress must pass legislation before Oct. 1 to continue funding the government. The package needs a simple majority in the House and 60 votes in the evenly divided Senate.
Mr. Manchin demanded the permitting bill as a condition of his support for the Democrats' climate, healthcare and tax proposal. But with that bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, now signed into law, he has struggled to build support for his permitting proposal. Some Democrats have objected to it on environmental grounds, while Republicans prefer a rival GOP bill from Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) with broader changes.
Mr. Manchin has said he is optimistic that, even if some of his Democratic colleagues reject the bill, it will get support from Republicans who have criticized the slow process for bringing infrastructure projects online. He has cautioned Republicans that there is no guarantee they will be able to secure better terms in a future Congress.
The bill contains proposals that are similar to prior measures from Republican lawmakers, including Clean Water Act changes from Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and mining projects from Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio.
The bill's release will give lawmakers an opportunity to go over the fine print of the proposal after several weeks of summaries from Mr. Manchin and Senate leaders about its contents.
Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) and several Democratic colleagues are pushing Mr. Schumer to keep the spending package and permitting package separate, stating in a letter that environmental issues "should be examined through detailed committee consideration and a robust floor debate separate from the urgent need to see that the government stays open." The letter was earlier reported by Politico.
Senate Republicans have also signaled their opposition, worried about giving momentum to Democrat-led initiatives before the midterms. Some still feel burned by Democrats' surprise deal to advance the climate, healthcare and tax legislation shortly after many Republicans voted with them to pass a $280 billion chips and science bill. Instead, they have chosen to back a different bill from Ms. Capito, the top Republican on the Environment and Public Works committee.
"Sen. Capito's fantastic bill only needs Sen. Manchin plus nine more Democrats to clear this chamber," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) in remarks on the floor Wednesday. "Otherwise, it would appear the senior senator from West Virginia traded his vote on a massive liberal boondoggle in exchange for nothing," he said.
Ms. Capito's bill, introduced last week as the Simplify Timelines and Assure Regulatory Transparency Act, would give states more power in overseeing the extraction of oil and gas, stall required air-quality improvements when companies expand their factories and eliminate smaller waterways from federal oversight.
Both bills contain measures aimed at accelerating the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 300-mile pipeline that would move natural gas from shale formations in northwestern West Virginia to southern Virginia and that environmental groups opposed.
Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.,) said he opposes the Mountain Valley Pipeline provision, as Congress should avoid putting a "thumb on the scale" by making permitting decisions sidestepping a full review of a project.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted to ratify an industry-backed climate treaty amendment that would commit the U.S. to reducing refrigerant chemicals that contribute to climate change.
The Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol treaty of 1987 would reduce the production and use of man-made hydrofluorocarbons used in air conditioners and other appliances, which scientists say warm the planet when released into the air. The original treaty was designed to phase out chemicals that depleted the planet's ozone layer.
The vote was 69-27, exceeding the required support of two-thirds of senators present to approve a treaty. It had backing from Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Tom Carper (D., Del.) and John Kennedy (R., La.), whose state is home to several chemical factories, as well as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).
The measure passed with a last-minute requirement: a provision that compels State Department officials to propose to the United Nations that it end China's status as a developing nation, a status that gives the country, a major HFC producer, more time to comply with phasing down usage. That requirement for State Department officials was added to the proposal by Sens. Dan Sullivan (R., Alaska) and Mike Lee (R., Utah). Senators voted 96-0 to include the requirement.
Ratification has the support of climate-advocacy groups and major business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Full text: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Recent catastrophic floods will wipe out economic growth and cause acute food shortages in Pakistan, officials warned, threatening to push a country reeling from economic and political instability into default.
Pakistan was looking to an International Monetary Fund bailout it secured in August and a package of global loan rollovers and investments to help restore finances hit hard by price shocks caused by the Ukraine war. But plans to regain financial health have been upended by monsoon rains that hammered the usually arid southern regions of the country with five times more rain than they typically see, wiping out houses, bridges, roads and crops.
Government officials estimate at least $30 billion of economic damage and reconstruction costs, or about 10% of gross domestic product. The figure has tripled from an early estimate in August, and officials expect it to rise further. The United Nations Development Program, with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, expect to complete an assessment of flood damage and reconstruction costs by mid-October.
Domestic resources can only meet a fraction of the government's estimated cost and the international aid received falls far short of the country's needs. Pakistan is in discussions with the U.N. over holding an international donor conference to raise flood-relief funds.
"The path to solvency was narrow. It has gotten narrower," Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said.
Bond and currency markets, which had shown more confidence in Pakistan after the IMF deal, are again pricing in a high risk of the country defaulting on its foreign debt. Since the end of August, the yields on some of the government's international bonds have jumped by a third, while the currency is one of the worst-performing in Asia, down 25% over the past 12 months.
Globally, more countries are deemed to be at a high risk of defaulting, after inflationary ripples from the Ukraine war coincided with rising interest rates in the U.S., adding to pressure on indebted nations. Sri Lanka defaulted this year, while in Africa, Ghana is seen as being at high risk. But a default by Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, would deeply rattle investor confidence in emerging markets.
Official data show the country's foreign-exchange reserves stand at about $9 billion, only enough to cover about six weeks of imports, some analysts say. The country must repay debt of more than $20 billion in the year that started July 1.
Before the floods, the IMF had forecast growth of 3.5% for the fiscal year. The government estimates the disaster will knock some three percentage points off growth. Pakistan's initial calculations show the lost growth alone will cost the economy $10 billion.
The IMF program is both a lifeline and a straitjacket when it comes to the government's path ahead. In return for funding, it calls for strict limits on spending and borrowing to make the country's debt more sustainable. The body, which didn't respond to a request for comment, has given no indication of easing the terms of its loan, which provides $4 billion over the country's current financial year.
The lender has attributed Pakistan's crisis to its loose fiscal policies, though the IMF is, in general, in favor of targeted help for the poor. Pakistan says it is committed to remaining within the IMF program as a defense against default.
The government is looking at diverting close to half of its budget for development projects this fiscal year, which would provide some $1.5 billion, Mr. Ismail said. The provinces may be able to divert an additional $2 billion altogether from their budgets, he said.
It is uncertain how far the provincial governments, which hold much power, will cooperate with the national government. Two of the country's four provinces, housing two-thirds of the population, are run by the political party of Imran Khan, who was ousted as prime minister in April through a vote in Parliament. Mr. Khan has since been campaigning to topple the current government.
Pakistan will also push for compensation from richer countries at coming multilateral gatherings. Islamabad and U.N. officials have pointed to climate change as a cause of this year's heavy monsoon rains, saying the amount of rain and geographical distribution departed from the normal pattern.
That view was given some scientific backing on Thursday from World Weather Attribution, an initiative for climate researchers to collaborate for rapid assessment of whether climate change caused extreme weather events.
Officials have said immediate relief alone will cost over $1 billion. Many of the 33 million people affected haven't yet received such basic aid, charities say. More than 1,400 people were killed in the flooding, many of them children.
Some five million people are receiving food from the authorities, World Food Program and charities, says the U.N., which has made an appeal to raise $160 million to cover immediate lifesaving aid. The government has given one million affected families each a $110 emergency cash payment. The U.S. has announced the biggest aid contribution, $53 million.
Longer-term rebuilding costs will be massive. Without far more help, up to 11 million people will fall below the poverty line from the floods, said Aisha Pasha, Pakistan's deputy finance minister.

Full text: Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard is giving away the multibillion-dollar outdoor apparel business he founded nearly 50 years ago, with a goal of helping to tackle climate change.
Mr. Chouinard and his family have transferred their ownership of Patagonia to a trust and a nonprofit organization, as opposed to taking the privately held company public or selling it, the 83-year-old founder said in a letter Wednesday, titled, "Earth is now our only shareholder."
"It's been nearly 50 years since we began our experiment in responsible business, and we are just getting started," said Mr. Chouinard, a world-class mountain climber who started importing rugby shirts and other apparel in the 1970s for his friends to wear.
"If we have any hope of a thriving planet-- much less a thriving business-- 50 years from now, it is going to take all of us doing what we can with the resources we have. This is another way we've found to do our part."
Patagonia, based in Ventura, Calif., didn't respond to a request for comment.
The company made a name for itself selling fleece jackets, board shorts and plaid shirts. The fleece vests in particular have developed a cult following from people who work in finance, while the company's environmental- and social-conscious practices have earned dedicated buyers in other consumer spheres.
Patagonia will remain a for-profit business under the new arrangement and will continue to be run by Chief Executive Ryan Gellert, Mr. Chouinard said.

William Ruto Is
Sworn In as President
William Ruto was sworn in as Kenya's president on Tuesday after narrowly winning the Aug. 9 election in East Africa's most stable democracy, and quickly signaled that his leadership would be a strongly Christian one.
The Supreme Court last week rejected a challenge by losing candidate and longtime opposition figure Raila Odinga of the official results, completing a markedly peaceful election in a country with a history of troubled ones.
The 55-year-old Mr. Ruto was the deputy to departing President Uhuru Kenyatta but the two had a bitter split that left them not speaking for months. On Tuesday, the audience cheered as the two shook hands, and again as Mr. Kenyatta handed over the reins of power.

UNITED NATIONS
Climate Change
Is Getting Worse
With weather disasters costing $200 million a day and irreversible climate catastrophe looming, the world is "heading in the wrong direction," the United Nations says in a new report that pulls together the latest science on climate change.
The World Meteorological Organization, in the latest stark warning about global warming, said weather-related disasters have increased fivefold in the last 50 years and are killing 115 people a day on average -- and the fallout is poised to worsen.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cited the floods in Pakistan, heat waves in Europe, droughts in places such as China, the Horn of Africa, and the U.S. -- and pointed the finger at fossil fuels.
"There is nothing natural about the new scale of these disasters. They are the price of humanity's fossil fuel addiction," he said. "This year's United in Science report shows climate impacts heading into uncharted territories of destruction."
The report was drawn from data compiled by several U.N. agencies and partners.

RUSSIA
U.S. Accuses Moscow
Of Covert Meddling
Russia has covertly spent more than $300 million since 2014 to try to influence politicians and other officials in more than two dozen countries, the State Department alleges in a newly released cable.
The cable released Tuesday cites a new intelligence assessment of Russia's global covert efforts to support policies and parties sympathetic to Moscow. The cable doesn't name specific Russian targets but says the U.S. is providing classified information to select individual countries.
A senior administration official declined to say how much money Russia is believed to have spent in Ukraine, where President Volodymyr Zelensky and his top deputies have long accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of meddling in domestic politics.
Unlike declared efforts by foreign governments to lobby for preferred initiatives, Russia's covert influence involved using front organizations to funnel money to preferred causes or politicians, the cable alleges.
Russia's embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment.

KAZAKHSTAN
Pope Arrives for
Interfaith Meetings
Pope Francis begged for an end to Russia's "senseless and tragic war" in Ukraine as he arrived Tuesday in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan to join faith leaders from around the world in praying for peace.
The pope flew to the Kazakh capital of Nur-Sultan to meet with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev for an official state visit portion of his three-day trip.
On Wednesday and Thursday, he is slated to participate in a government-sponsored triennial interfaith meeting, which is gathering more than 100 delegations of Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Shinto and other faith groups from 50 countries.
The 85-year-old pope made the trip despite what appeared to be an aggravation of the strained knee ligaments that have greatly reduced his mobility all year.
Pope Francis struggled to walk through the aisle of the aircraft during the 6.5-hour flight from Rome, and he appeared tired and in pain as he limped heavily with his cane, ceding to a wheelchair for most events once in town.

AUSTRALIA
Kangaroo Kills Man
In Rare Fatal Attack
A man who may have been keeping a wild kangaroo as a pet was killed by the animal in southwest Australia, police said Tuesday. It reportedly was the first fatal attack by a kangaroo in Australia since 1936.
A relative found the 77-year-old man with "serious injuries" on his property Sunday in semirural Redmond, 250 miles southeast of the Western Australia state capital, Perth.
It was believed he had been attacked earlier in the day by the kangaroo, which police shot dead because it was preventing paramedics from reaching the injured man, police said. "The kangaroo was posing an ongoing threat to emergency responders," a police statement said.
The man died at the scene. Police were preparing a report for a coroner who will record an official cause to death.
Police believe the man had been keeping the wild kangaroo as a pet. There are legal restrictions on keeping Australian native fauna as pets, but the police media office said Tuesday they had no information to make public regarding whether he had a permit.

Full text: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has appointed Yue (Nina) Chen, a risk expert with experience at New York's financial regulator and at major banks, as its chief climate-risk officer.
The banking regulator on Monday announced the appointment of Dr. Chen, who trained as a chemical engineer, to lead the OCC's climate-risk effort. She will report directly to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, the OCC said.
Dr. Chen succeeds Jonathan Fink, who assumed the climate duties in an acting capacity in March while also serving as a senior adviser to Mr. Hsu.
The OCC under Mr. Hsu has urged the financial services industry to manage the risks posed by climate change, and in December released draft guidance that included principles on how large banks should address climate-related risk in their governance, policies and strategies.
Previously, Dr. Chen worked at the New York State Department of Financial Services as a climate-risk expert and in November was tapped to head its newly created climate division.
"Dr. Chen is a tremendous talent and her contributions to DFS, leading our first-in-the-nation climate division, were vast and always appreciated," the regulator said in a statement.
Dr. Chen also served as vice chairwoman of the climate risk steering group of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, a Switzerland-based organization of insurance regulators that sets global standards for the sector. Before her time at DFS, she served as director of conservation investments at the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group, and held positions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Canada.

Full text: LONDON -- Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son, Charles, has spent nearly his entire life in waiting as heir to the British throne, watching his mother navigate decades of social and political change. On Thursday he inherited a monarchy that faces the challenge of hewing to ancient tradition while adapting to reflect modern Britain.
The 73-year-old king, who will reign as Charles III, was by his mother's side in Balmoral on Thursday as she died at age 96. For nearly a decade, his mother gradually handed over responsibilities to her son in preparation for his succession.
"Her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world," King Charles said in a statement.
Aides to King Charles, formerly Prince of Wales, have said the new monarch envisions a slimmed-down and lower-cost royal family that remains at the center of Britain's national life. To do that, he must unite his family as the House of Windsor is grappling with strained relationships.
His first task will be to lead a country in mourning as it comes to terms with the death of Queen Elizabeth -- the only monarch most people in Britain have ever known. He is expected to address the nation on Friday, and later tour it.
King Charles isn't universally popular with his subjects. With a 42% approval rating, Prince Charles was the seventh-most-popular British royal in a recent YouGov poll, below his son Prince William. The queen was the most popular, with 75%.
Palace aides said they expect his popularity to rise as the country grows accustomed to him in the role of king.
Unlike his mother, who was in her 20s when she became queen and deferred to more experienced courtiers inherited from her father, King Charles has had decades to study for the role. He is the oldest man to ascend to the British throne, eclipsing William IV, who took over in 1830 at the age of 64.
Two previous monarchs-in-waiting who held the title of Prince of Wales -- the eventual King Edward VII and King Edward VIII -- were playboys. As a prince, King Charles took the role in a more serious direction. In 1976, he created the Prince's Trust, a charity that helps young people.
During her seven-decade reign, Queen Elizabeth was careful to largely steer clear of political debate, allowing her to act as a symbol of British unity.
As a prince, Charles was more willing to use his status to push for change, particularly on issues related to the environment and climate change.
Officials say King Charles will step back, but not totally abandon those campaigning ways. "He will be a convener king," said an aide.
Some of his campaigns have proven farsighted, said Judith Rowbotham, a University of Plymouth constitutional law scholar. Buckingham Palace was bathed in green light during the recent United Nations climate summit to symbolize the monarchy's concern about climate change.
In 2018, he was asked during a documentary about his life whether the campaigning would continue if he became king. "No, it won't. I'm not that stupid," he replied.
In 2020, in an acrimonious split, King Charles's son Prince Harry quit royal duties, causing a rift with his brother, Prince William. The new king will have to manage the continued fallout. King Charles also dealt with the scandal surrounding his brother Prince Andrew's ties to disgraced U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Meanwhile, his rocky marriage and divorce from the late Princess Diana still hangs over him. "There are a lot of people who disapprove of him and who can't forgive him for that," said Penny Junor, author of books on the royal family.
King Charles was portrayed in an unflattering manner in the Netflix drama "The Crown," which has been watched by millions worldwide. Aides worry this has dented his image.
From a young age the reality of his future as king weighed on him. Shortly before his 21st birthday, he was asked when it was that he realized he was heir to the throne. "I think it's something that dawns on you with the most ghastly inexorable sense. . .and slowly you get the idea that you have a certain duty and responsibility," he replied.
A key issue facing the king, say members of the court, is pruning back the monarchy. The royal family's expenditures have nearly tripled over the past decade, reaching <pound>87.5 million in 2021, equivalent to around $101 million, according to filings. Aides say the idea is to focus on King Charles and his immediate heirs.
King Charles was heavily involved in negotiations when Prince Harry decided to quit royal duties after marrying actress Meghan Markle. That split turned acrimonious. During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, now based in California, accused the royal family of racism in its ranks, allegations the queen said were being looked into privately.
One bright spot for the king is his private life, which has found stability following his marriage in 2005 to Camilla Parker Bowles, a divorcee with whom the prince had a long-term relationship. Before her death, the queen expressed her wish that she be named queen consort when Charles acceded the throne.
Now in his 70s, King Charles may soon have to make way for those next in line. "As in every family, there comes a point when the younger generation do start kind of calling the shots for the receding generation," said Ms. Junor.

Renewables' Success Skews Carbon Market --- Wind and solar projects, viable on their own, still sell offsets to polluters, say critics

Full text: With its 34 turbines perched on a hill in southwestern India, the Tuppadahalli wind farm generates green energy -- and profits.
The wind farm and three others in India are owned by Acciona SA, an 8.1 billion euro Spanish infrastructure conglomerate which held an IPO of its renewables business last year. Tuppadahalli is performing so well that an Indian credit-ratings firm upgraded it, citing its strong cash position, modest debt and long-term contracts to sell the energy.
Under the standards set by a 21-year-old United Nations program, however, Tuppadahalli is considered a toddling startup that still needs regular infusions of cash to stay in business. This means it can benefit from a large and growing global market in so-called voluntary carbon credits set up to allow corporations to offset their own greenhouse-gas emissions by funding mitigation projects in other parts of the world.
Last year, Delta Air Lines Inc. bought nearly 300,000 credits from Tuppadahalli for an undisclosed price, representing about 300,000 metric tons of carbon output that would have been added to India's air pollution had the wind farm's energy production come instead from traditional power generation. This allowed Delta to get closer to its pledge to curb its own emissions without taking drastic actions to overhaul its existing operations, such as switching away from jet fuel or grounding planes.
Transactions like this undercut the basic concept behind carbon offsets -- that they should fund green projects that wouldn't be possible without the additional cash they bring. Now that renewable energy can stand on its own financially, some investors, researchers and government regulators say companies buying these credits are just transferring cash to other established companies. They say the old U.N. program, which spawned thousands of similar projects and makes up a large chunk of the market for offsets, is draining money from newer initiatives that need it more, such as experiments in capturing carbon directly from the air.
The end result is that companies looking to offset their emissions are buying credits in vast numbers that do little to help neutralize their carbon output.
Pedro Martins Barata, a former executive board member of the U.N. program, known as the Clean Development Mechanism, or CDM, says he is concerned the market lacks transparency, making it difficult for buyers to understand which projects would have happened without issuing credits. "No one should buy any of that stuff anymore," said Mr. Martins, who is now a senior director at the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.
Delta declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Acciona's renewables unit said the company followed the U.N.'s own guidelines, and that "the U.N.'s goal is to make these investments attractive to promote clean development."
Surging demand for credits is being driven by companies, often under pressure from investors, governments and customers, to reduce their net carbon footprint. More than 5,000 companies have signed a U.N. pledge to eliminate or offset their greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. Around a third of the companies in the S&P 500 index now have such pledges, up from 1% in 2018, a Bank of America study found.
Sales of carbon credits in the voluntary market that includes the CDM reached nearly $2 billion for the first time last year, according to environmental finance data provider Ecosystem Marketplace.
While that is much smaller than the markets that grew out of strict cap-and-trade regimes imposed by governments in Europe and elsewhere to force major polluters to limit their carbon output, the voluntary market plays an outsize role in efforts by a broad cross-section of corporations to position themselves as good environmental stewards.
The CDM represented an early effort to establish a carbon-credit market. What its designers didn't realize at the time was how quickly renewables would blossom, fed by separate government subsidies that drove huge increases in scale, which in turn lowered prices of components for solar panels and wind turbines. These days, the cost of generating electricity from such sources is roughly on par with that of fossil fuels.
M. Massamba Thioye, a project executive for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, defended the CDM's legacy, arguing that it helped accelerate the maturation of the renewable-energy sector, especially in China and India. "In the absence of the CDM, we would not have the same situation," he said.
Although the original CDM program all but shut down after 2012, its projects continued pumping out millions of credits for years, many of which have recently come on the market.
As the CDM stepped back, two nonprofits established by environmental and business leaders moved in to act as arbiters of what qualifies as a carbon credit, and also to register credits so they can be sold and claimed by only a single party. Gold Standard, started in Geneva, with backing from environmental and climate groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature; and Verra, based in Washington, D.C., say they are raising standards for the voluntary carbon market, and corporations rely on them to give a seal of approval to their purchases.
Both Gold Standard and Verra stopped accrediting new renewable-energy projects in 2020, acknowledging that they tend to be profitable on their own. But they decided to grandfather older, CDM-era projects and allow them to issue new credits until roughly 2030, arguing that to do otherwise would have created uncertainty in the marketplace.
Verra's chief executive, David Antonioli, disputes the idea that old credits siphon away money from more-deserving initiatives. The Verra registry includes numerous new projects such as one that substitutes efficient cook stoves for open-pit fires or others that improve agricultural processes to curb the production of CO2.
Gold Standard's role is to help the market buy the highest-quality credits, not police it, said the Geneva-based certifier's chief technical officer, Owen Hewlett.
In the voluntary marketplace, credits linked to CDM-era renewable-energy projects tend to be less expensive, reflecting the perception that they aren't very effective at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
More than a third of the credits bought by companies and others last year -- 54 million -- were generated by such projects, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of credits verified by Verra and Gold Standard.
Spotify AB, Boeing Co., Lyft Inc., Delta and many others have loaded up on credits that originated under the CDM and were then repackaged through Verra and Gold Standard.
Spotify declined to comment. Lyft will move away from using carbon credits by shifting to all-electric vehicles on its platform by 2030, a company spokesman said. Boeing carefully selects the credits it buys to ensure they cause no net harm, a company spokesman said.
In June, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it was looking at the quality of carbon credits and the growth of the market. "Concerns about transparency, credibility, and greenwashing may hamper the integrity and growth of these markets," CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero said in a speech.
United Airlines' Chief Executive Scott Kirby is among critics of voluntary carbon offsets, charging that they allow buyers to tout their emissions reductions while failing to take effective action to limit climate change. He calls these credits "borderline fraud" that allow CEOs to "pretend that they've done the right thing for sustainability when they haven't made one whit of difference in the real world."
He said United is committed to getting to zero emissions over the longer term by investing in technologies that capture carbon from the air and in companies developing alternatives to jet fuel.
The CDM emerged from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which allowed industrialized countries to meet greenhouse-gas reduction goals by funding projects elsewhere.
The program set off building sprees of solar, wind and hydro power projects launched by giant companies and funded by governments. By the end of 2011, the U.N. program had nearly 4,000 registered projects, nearly half of which were wind farms or hydroelectric facilities mostly in China and India, according to an analysis of U.N. data from the Copenhagen Climate Center, a climate-advisory institution.
Chinese wind power capacity eligible to sell credits grew by 70% or more each year between 2006 and 2012 and at one point accounted for 90% of the country's overall wind energy capacity, the Journal's analysis shows.
But China has struggled to use its wind power, which means in practice the credits did little to offset carbon emissions. Some turbines weren't connected to the power grid and others couldn't sell electricity as grid operators rejected wind energy in favor of traditional fossil-fuel sources, according to researchers from Carnegie Mellon University.
Music-streaming service Spotify turned to carbon credits when making an aggressive emissions pledge in 2021 to effectively eliminate its greenhouse-gas emissions in the next decade. The effort "can't be something we do on the side -- it has to be integrated into our everyday business," the company said.
Spotify emitted 309,400 tons of carbon in 2020, according to its sustainability reports. The company has since bought 202,000 carbon credits identified by the Journal, half of which came from renewable energy projects like the ones that originated under the CDM. One batch of nearly 6,000 credits came from wind farms built by a utility with more than $8 billion in revenue in 2021 that is owned by China Three Gorges Co., the builder of the namesake dam and one of the world's largest energy firms.
Like other companies, Spotify has bought better-quality credits too. About 18% of the credits bought by Spotify were for typically more expensive forestry credits such as a project to restore land in Panama destroyed by cattle grazing.
In India, wind capacity from subsidized carbon credit projects grew by 25 times between 2006 and 2012, eventually accounting for half the country's overall wind capacity, according to the Journal's analysis.
In 2011, Spain's Acciona applied to the U.N.'s CDM program to create and issue carbon credits from a string of wind farms it was building in India. Construction on the Tuppadahalli wind farm began in 2010 and the next year it was ready to generate electricity, according to Acciona news releases. In 2012, the project was approved by the U.N. to issue credits based on an assumption the clean electricity generated from wind would annually displace an average of 129,000 tons of CO2 by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
Researchers from Georgetown University, the University of Virginia and the London School of Economics faulted such reasoning. The researchers identified 265 Indian wind-farm projects, including Tuppadahalli, that they said likely should have been denied approval because similar projects were profitable without the sale of carbon credits.
Tuppadahalli didn't sell any CDM credits in its early years, and in December 2012, the project registered with Verra. Acciona sold only a handful of credits until 2021, when Delta Air Lines stepped up.
In 2020, Delta announced plans to spend $1 billion on sustainability efforts over the next decade to become the "first carbon neutral airline globally" on investments including more fuel-efficient fleets, technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and carbon credits, according to a news release, company comment and a Journal analysis of registry data.
In April 2021, Delta purchased 13 million credits for $30 million from several projects including one that protects rainforests in Indonesia and from the Tuppadahalli wind farm, according to a press release and a Journal analysis of registry data.
To justify the sale of the credits, Acciona said its wind farm needed the money because rising costs made the project less profitable, according to correspondence between Acciona and an auditor validating the company's request to issue new credits.
Verra, which very rarely rejects requests to issue new credits when conducting reviews, allowed Acciona to proceed, said the manager of Verra's Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards program, Christopher Chapman.

Full text: Californians narrowly averted rolling blackouts on Tuesday, but the threat looms all week amid an unpleasant but not unusual heat wave. This ought to be a warning about how the government force-fed green energy transition is endangering grid reliability, but Democrats and the media can't break out of their climate-change conformity to think clearly, or think at all.
Democrats blame climate change for the state's week-long warnings to conserve power, but California's climate hasn't suddenly changed. Triple-digit temperatures aren't unprecedented even in early September, despite Gov. Gavin Newsom's claims. What has drastically changed in recent years is California's electric generation.
Solar and wind power have rapidly expanded thanks to rich government subsidies along with the state's renewables mandate. These have made it harder for baseload gas and nuclear generators that run around the clock to make money. Many have shut down, and the result is that the state often lacks sufficient power when the sun goes down.
California's summer electric generation capacity increased by about 10,700 megawatts (MW) between 2010 and 2020 -- potentially enough to power eight to 10 million homes. The problem is that gas-fired capacity during this time declined by 4,390 MW and nuclear by 2,150 MW. Solar and wind surged 17,000 MW, but those sources can't be commanded to run when people need them.
The state must therefore rely on imports from other states in the evenings, especially during heat waves. But these imports are becoming less dependable since California's neighbors are also losing base-load generators owing to their own renewable buildouts. Arizona lost about half of its summer coal-generating capacity between 2015 and 2020.
During heat waves that span the Southwest like the one this week, California must resort to emergency measures to reduce electricity demand. This includes asking users to turn up their thermostats and providing incentives for industrial businesses to power down. A desalination plant in Carlsbad cut water production by about 20% earlier this week to free up power for homes. Not what the state needs during a drought.
The climate left blames drought for causing a reduction in the state's hydropower, but why didn't lawmakers and grid managers prepare for such a scenario? Drought conditions aren't uncommon in the state. The truth is that politicians put too much faith in utility-scale batteries to save the day, but these are expensive and have been hard to scale.
Irony of ironies, the state has installed temporary gas-fired generators to run during grid emergencies. In other words, the state that is working so hard to banish fossil fuels has become more dependent on them. Los Angeles's municipal utility is generating nearly 30% of its electricity from coal, some of which is being shared with the rest of the state. Call it Gavin Newsom's dirty little climate secret.
Meantime, power shortages are causing prices to spike in the Golden State as they are in Europe. Electricity prices in California's wholesale market surged Tuesday evening to about $1,700 per MWh compared to the normal $100 and $67 a year ago. All of this explains why residential electric rates in California have risen by 50% in the past two years -- three times more than they have nationwide.
Californians paid on average about 29 cents per kilowatt hour in June, by far the most in the continental U.S. and twice as much as in neighboring states. Rates are only going higher. Green-energy subsidies don't make electricity cheaper. They create market distortions that threaten the grid and raise prices.
But what starts in California rarely stays in California. Americans everywhere will soon be soaked with higher prices for power that is becoming less reliable. Rhode Island Energy this summer asked regulators to more than double current electric rates for this winter. Falling gasoline prices for many Americans could be fully offset by rising electricity costs.
The grid problems that Californians are enduring will grow and spread as supersized green-energy subsidies and mandates spread their harmful incentives throughput the U.S. economy in coming years. The culprit is the left's climate policies, not climate change.

Full text: KHAIRPUR NATHAN SHAH, Pakistan -- This used to be a thriving town of more than 300,000 people, surrounded by rice fields in southern Pakistan. Now it takes 40 minutes on a motorboat to reach Khairpur Nathan Shah.
The tops of tall houses, gas stations and factories poking out of the water now mark what is left of a town that has been swallowed up by a vast inland sea that emerged in recent days, as record monsoon rainfall accumulated in Sindh province. The inundated area is large enough to be visible from space, and some 200 miles long, NASA satellite images show.
This summer, Pakistan has seen rainfall three times the average -- the United Nations secretary-general last week called it a "monsoon on steroids." In the southern half of the country, it has been even worse.
Around Khairpur Nathan Shah, those unwilling to leave their property behind or too poor to survive elsewhere are marooned on those rooftops that remain above the water line. They are among the worst off among the millions hit by a catastrophe that Pakistani officials have blamed on climate change. It can take months to assess if climate change made a particular weather event more likely or more severe, but scientists have projected that warming temperatures could intensify episodes of extreme rainfall.
The normally arid southern region, one of the poorest parts of Pakistan, was hit hardest by this summer's monsoon, an annual downpour usually concentrated in the mountainous north.
Khairpur Nathan Shah and surrounding villages were flooded suddenly last week when embankment defenses in the area gave way under the volume of water pushing against them, locals said. Water levels are still rising in the south of the country, days after the last major rains fell.
Mukhtar Ali said he ran from his village when the floods arrived, managing to grab two bags of flour. The rest of his food, enough for two to three months, were washed away. "We had to decide whether we get our children out, or our beds or our food."
On Friday, Mehboob Chandio was among a group of men neck-deep in the murky, stagnant water filling Khairpur Nathan Shah's main street. Mr. Chandio said they had waded through the waters for an hour, from their mostly submerged village, to get to a shop on higher ground to buy food.
"The children and women in my village have no food, no water to drink. Please get something to them," he shouted in reply to questions from a Wall Street Journal reporter aboard a small rescue boat run by the Edhi Foundation, a Pakistani charity. He declined an offer from rescue workers to be pulled on board, saying: "We are staying to guard our possessions."
Amid the calamity, thieves in boats are raiding homes at night, locals said. The poor can't afford to leave behind their livestock and other assets, residents said, nor do they have the money needed to survive elsewhere. Some thought, wrongly, that their part of town would be safe, as it was in major floods of 2010.
"I'm a factory owner, not a beggar. But I'm nothing now," Nasrullah Jamali, a man who had climbed atop a town monument sticking out of the water, said after he was pulled on board the boat. "The government has completely failed."
Jam Khan Shoro, the irrigation minister in the provincial government of Sindh, said an embankment designed to protect the area had been raised by six feet after the 2010 flood. But, he said, there was so much water that it went over the top.
The U.N. said nearly 33,000 square miles appear to be affected by floodwaters as of Aug. 31, or more than 10% of the country.
More than 1,200 people have died and more than 30 million are affected, officials say, putting the disaster on the scale of the disastrous 2010 floods.
Officials in Sindh province said they were still focused on rescue operations, and hadn't been able to fully turn to providing aid. Across the province, 6.5 million are homeless, the Sindh government said.
At Khairpur Nathan Shah, power lines are in the water, or suspended just above the water line, a further obstacle to rescue efforts.
There isn't much help available even for those who reach land. Hundreds are living near the village of Muhammad Yusuf Naich, where a few miles of higher ground remain. Some displaced families have erected makeshift shelters by stringing together tree branches or bamboo to form a frame and then stretching plastic sheeting over the top, to provide some shade from the punishing sunlight.
The government has said it has provided cash handouts totaling $90 million to 793,000 affected families nationwide. The army says it rescued more than 50,000 people, and provided medical help to over 60,000 people.
Still, Faisal Edhi, the head of the Edhi Foundation who spent nine days in the flooded areas, said most people affected hadn't received aid.
So far, 44 flights carrying aid from other countries, led by planes from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, China and the U.N., have arrived, the Pakistani authorities have said. The U.S. has pledged $30 million.
Ahsan Iqbal, the minister overseeing the flood response, said rich countries, those most responsible historically for carbon emissions that have led to climate change, must do more. Mr. Iqbal said the government would have to raise its initial estimates that the disaster had caused some $10 billion of economic damage, given the losses of infrastructure, homes and crops.
"We are doing whatever is possible for us," Mr. Iqbal said. "It is colossal damage, and much beyond Pakistan's resources."

Full text: Shell PLC is laying groundwork to replace longtime Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden as the Dutchman prepares to step down after nine years running the London-based energy company, according to people familiar with the matter.
Shell executives have told the people close to the company that Mr. van Beurden is preparing to leave next year, the people said, capping a period of continuous change at Shell and within the oil-and-gas industry. Mr. van Beurden earlier presided over Shell's largest fossil-fuel acquisition in years. More recently he has pledged to reduce the company's greenhouse-gas emissions and increase its investments in renewable energy.
Candidates to succeed the 64-year-old Mr. van Beurden include Wael Sawan, head of Shell's integrated gas and renewables business, who has been described by people inside and close to the company in recent months as the internal front-runner. Mr. Sawan, 48 years old, joined Shell in 1997 and has steadily taken on expanded responsibilities alongside the natural-gas business he heads that is behind Shell's record profits recently. He declined to comment.
The CEO-change plans, earlier reported by Reuters, have involved a shortlisting process by Shell's board that includes other candidates on the executive committee, people close to the company said. The other potential successors discussed by directors have included Sinead Gorman, the global finance chief since April who joined Shell in 1999; Huibert Vigeveno, head of the downstream businesses including chemicals, with Shell since 1995; and Zoe Yujnovich, upstream director and the relative newcomer on the list, who joined Shell in 2014 from the mining industry.
The Shell executives declined to comment or couldn't be reached. A Shell spokesman also declined to comment. It isn't clear how close the board is to a final decision, but one person said executives have described the process as having accelerated over the past several months.
Shell, like some of its peers, has sought to balance its traditional business producing and trading oil, gas, refined fuels and chemicals with renewable-energy initiatives such as solar and wind power aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
Multinational oil companies face pressure from investors, governments and the public to address climate change. Shell has appealed a landmark 2021 Dutch court ruling ordering the company to pick up the pace at which it is reducing carbon emissions. The company says it is being unfairly singled out in the case, brought by environmental groups that alleged Shell's production of oil and natural gas contributed to climate change.
The Dutch climate case has made Mr. van Beurden a target for environmental groups such as dozens of protesters who delayed Shell's annual shareholder meeting in May in London by almost three hours, chanting that Shell was endangering global climate goals. That pressure won't subside for a new CEO. Shell also faces U.S. court cases against multiple oil-and-gas companies over their alleged contributions to climate change.
Mr. van Beurden was already a 30-year veteran of Shell when he was promoted in 2013 from his role running its refining and marketing operations to take over as CEO, effective January 2014.
Shell completed its biggest acquisition in decades in 2016, buying rival BG Group for more than $50 billion, transforming its footprint in natural gas in ways that have paid off handsomely over the past year.
In November 2021, Shell -- then called Royal Dutch Shell PLC -- said it would consolidate its dual British and Dutch structure and relocate its headquarters to London rather than The Hague.
Mr. van Beurden made "bold shareholder-friendly moves" as CEO, including focusing Shell on spending money more efficiently and giving priority to dividends over capital investment, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said in a research note Friday. Mr. Clint said the CEO's departure will be a loss for investors, but that Shell's executive bench.
Mr. van Beurden's CEO tenure experienced wild swings in commodity prices and downturns that included cratering energy demand early in the Covid-19 pandemic. This year has seen Shell and its oil-major peers rebound with banner profits, spurring billions of dollars in share buybacks and increased shareholder dividends.

Full text: Republicans are stepping up their efforts to prevent investors from considering environmental and other factors in their decisions. They are running up against the trillions of dollars in investments committed to funds addressing such concerns.
In the past week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials banned state pension fund managers from incorporating environmental, social and governance -- or ESG -- factors into investments. Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar barred BlackRock Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG and others from doing business there because they "boycott energy companies." West Virginia in July took a similar step, kicking out BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and others while saying ESG hurts its economy.
The criticism focuses on the belief that Wall Street and investors are cutting off fossil-fuel producers from lending and investment. Republicans have also accused investors of trying to force companies to follow a liberal agenda at the expense of a pursuit of profit.
Investors still heavily finance oil and natural gas. They say the factors, including addressing climate change, improving corporate governance and encouraging diversity, boost profits.
ESG funds and climate investing are two of the fastest-growing parts of the investment industry. Globally, hundreds of new funds are added each quarter and they together hold some $2.5 trillion, a large portion of which is invested in U.S. companies, according to Morningstar.
Investors are paying nearly a record premium for shares of companies with the best ESG scores over the ones with the worst ratings, Bank of America Corp. analysts found. Surveys from the Index Industry Association, a trade group for index providers, and others show investors are making ESG more of a priority while snapping up green bonds and investing in climate startups.
ESG "is definitely the highest-growth part of the business," Nasdaq Inc. Chief Executive Adena Friedman said on the company's most recent earnings call. The exchange operator works with businesses on their strategies.
Companies have raised about $320 billion in green bonds and loans this year. They have borrowed $400 billion more in debt with incentives to hit sustainability targets, according to Dealogic. Startups developing everything from solar farms to clean hydrogen have privately raised $27 billion in equity, PitchBook data show.
Market volatility and rising interest rates have pushed funding in these areas below last year's record totals but they are still ahead of the clips from 2019 and 2020.
Driving the bets is a hunt for the next Tesla Inc., falling costs that made renewable-energy projects competitive and concerns about flooding, wildfires, drought and storms that have been made worse by climate change.
Clean-energy tax credits that are part of the new Inflation Reduction Act have added further incentives for investors in these areas.
"If you look at where capital is going to be deployed, it's going to be in renewable-energy technology and infrastructure," said PJ Deschenes, a managing director at investment bank Nomura Holdings Inc. focused on the sector. "People are looking forward and seeing huge growth coming."
He and others say that ESG investing, which is centered on mutual and exchange-traded funds that generally track the broader market, is a small part of a significant shift in the deployment of capital to address climate change. ESG is controversial because it is loosely defined and often head-scratching in its designations. It has been criticized by a range of investors and businesses and is under scrutiny by regulators.
Wall Street firms, including those facing boycotts from state governments, still lend billions to fossil-fuel producers, saying it is profitable and necessary.
Debt financing for oil-and-gas companies is generally about the same size as green-bond funding, Dealogic data show. Some banks have said they are cutting lending to coal producers, and most have promised to gradually lower financing for other fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Some fossil-fuel producers are benefiting from ESG as they get credit for investing billions in clean energy through hydrogen, carbon capture and renewable fuels. As the Inflation Reduction Act made its way through Congress, Republicans pressured Exxon CEO Darren Woods and others who had praised incentives for those new lines of business to oppose the bill, highlighting tension between the Republican Party and the oil industry.
Critics of ESG say companies should focus only on maximizing returns for shareholders. Among the most prominent is "Woke, Inc." author Vivek Ramaswamy, who launched an energy ETF that is nearly identical to a comparable BlackRock product in holding big fossil-fuel companies and some renewables. The distinction, he says, is he will push management to only focus on profits to provide an alternative to big asset managers that weigh ESG factors in those discussions.
"The key difference is the shareholder voice and vote," he said. His firm's ETF topped $300 million in assets in its first three weeks, a strong start for a new fund.
Shareholder proposals pushing back against company ESG initiatives and disclosures have gotten less support than proposals overall. Nearly 45 anti-ESG proposals were introduced at annual meetings for companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co. between January and June, according to Morningstar. They received about 7% support, on average, compared with 30% for shareholder resolutions overall.
There is evidence that kicking banks out of their municipal-bond markets will end up hurting taxpayers. Academic studies have shown similar moves have decreased competition in local markets and pushed up borrowing costs. An assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and a Federal Reserve economist recently estimated Texas entities paid several hundred million dollars in additional interest in the eight months after the state initially passed its anti-ESG law last year.
Texas' Mr. Hegar and West Virginia state Treasurer Riley Moore said they aren't worried, because other Wall Street firms with less restrictive approaches will step in to replace those they kicked out.
"I'm not the distortion in the marketplace," Mr. Moore said. "They are."

Full text: The West has begun to muster the money and political support to keep decades-old nuclear reactors from shutting, aiming to maintain a crucial source of low-carbon electricity as many economies face an energy crunch.
The U.S., France and a handful of other countries are planning to keep dozens of reactors running decades after their original operating licenses expire. Belgium is moving to allow two reactors that were set to close in 2025 to operate until 2036 to help Europe wean itself off Russian natural gas after the invasion of Ukraine.
Germany, which was set to close all its reactors by the end of the year, is now debating whether to keep the last three open into next year to help save gas through the winter as Moscow has sharply cut shipments of the fuel. Some politicians are calling for the reactors to remain open even longer.
Japan's prime minister called last week for the country to reopen more of its nuclear reactors because of the high price of natural gas, after the country idled most of them in the aftermath of the 2011 meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.
Those moves reflect a growing consensus that the global economy needs every megawatt of nuclear energy available to bolster energy supplies and help meet United Nations climate targets, which call for global net greenhouse-gas emissions to fall to zero by the middle of the century.
Natural-gas prices have soared as Russia clamps down on exports, softening antinuclear sentiment in countries such as Germany and Japan that import lots of gas. Maintaining and replacing equipment for an existing reactor is also far cheaper and simpler than building a new one. Western nations have spent tens of billions of dollars over the past decade on a handful of new reactors that are years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.
France is proposing to build up to 14 new large reactors in the coming decades. The U.K., the Czech Republic, Poland and other countries are planning to build new reactors as well. Utilities in the U.S. and Europe are considering building small modular reactors that backers said will be easier to build than larger ones. But these projects are likely at least a decade away from delivering power to customers, some analysts said.
The cost of keeping reactors open also compares favorably with replacing them with other low-carbon sources of electricity such as wind turbines and solar panels that suffer from the unpredictability of the elements, the International Energy Agency said. Nuclear power produces close to zero emissions of carbon dioxide, the main gas scientists have said is causing the Earth to warm.
"Extending nuclear plants' lifetimes is an indispensable part of a cost-effective path to net zero by 2050," the IEA said in a report this summer. "Yet decisions about how long to operate these plants threaten to erode that foundation."
Some reactors are closing anyway. The U.K.'s Hinkley Point B plant shut for good on Aug. 1, despite suggestions from some U.K. lawmakers that it could be kept open to bolster energy supplies through the winter. U.K. ministers said they didn't ask the plant's owner, EDF Energy, a subsidiary of French state-controlled power giant EDF SA, to run it longer. All the U.K.'s other reactors are set to close by 2028, though EDF Energy has said it is reviewing whether to seek a 20-year operating extension for another reactor it owns.
Local officials in Canada are moving ahead with the shutdown of the Pickering plant in Ontario starting in 2024. The Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan shut in May. The Diablo Canyon plant, which generates around 8% of California's electricity, is slated to begin shutting down in 2024, but Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed keeping it open until 2029 and possibly longer.
There are technical and financial obstacles to prolonging the lives of reactors. In the U.K., EDF Energy has been monitoring the appearance of cracks in graphite blocks in the reactor cores. The problem is specific to the U.K.'s main reactor design, which isn't used anywhere else in the world. EDF Energy has said the cracks can't be repaired.
In the U.S., 13 U.S. nuclear reactors have shut since 2013, largely because the low cost of alternative fuels such as natural gas rendered nuclear energy unprofitable.
State governments in recent years have provided subsidies to stop closures. U.S. climate legislation signed into law this month offers tax credits to help nuclear reactors stay open, with an estimated cost of $30 billion over the next decade.
Keeping reactors running beyond the period covered by their initial operating license -- usually 40 years -- entails major investments to ensure safety. France, which has the largest nuclear fleet in Europe, is spending 50 billion euros, or about $50 billion, to ensure all 56 of its nuclear reactors can continue operating after 40 years.
Nuclear-plant owners also need to take account of the growing risk that climate change poses to their operations, officials said. Almost all nuclear plants are located next to the sea or rivers to supply vast quantities of water for generating electricity and cooling the reactor core. That makes them potentially vulnerable to the effects of rising sea levels, increasing drought and higher storm intensity.
This summer, France lowered production at several reactors because the river water they use to generate electricity was too low and too warm.
Near the southern tip of Florida, the Turkey Point nuclear power plant sits on land that scientists have said is threatened by rising seas and more powerful storms as the Earth warms. It also holds the first reactor in the world that the nuclear industry has proposed to keep operating for up to 80 years, placing it at the leading edge of the debate.
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2019 approved a 20-year extension of the operating license for the plant's two reactors, the second 20-year extension received by the plant after its original 40-year license expired. The NRC did so using an environmental analysis by the plant's owner, NextEra Energy Inc. subsidiary Florida Power & Light, that was based largely on a template for the plant's previous 20-year extension.
This year, the NRC reversed that decision after environmentalists challenged it, ruling that the analysis wasn't sufficient to comply with the law. Environmental groups said the plant's cooling system -- a large network of canals next to the plant -- is at risk of more powerful storm surges, threatening sensitive habitats in Biscayne Bay and the Everglades near the plant.
"We've got a lot of old plants being exposed to extreme weather," said Caroline Reiser, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the environmental groups that challenged the decision. "It's kind of a dangerous combination to be ignoring."
Florida Power & Light said the plant is elevated 20 feet above sea level and has a host of measures to protect it from flooding. After the accident at Fukushima, the company submitted a study to regulators concluding the plant could withstand severe flooding, including a storm surge bigger than the one produced by Hurricane Andrew, one of the most powerful storms ever recorded in the U.S.
"If new information about changing environmental conditions becomes available, FPL and the NRC will evaluate the new information to determine if any safety-related changes are needed at its nuclear-power plants," company spokesman Bill Orlove said.

Climate Change
Is Blamed for Floods
Pakistan's top climate official blamed climate change for the country's deadliest flooding in more than a decade, as intense monsoon rains washed away villages and crops, killing more than 900 people since late June.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has said the country saw its wettest July since 1961.
Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman called this year's rainfall a "monster monsoon" and said Thursday that the country was experiencing "a humanitarian disaster driven by climate change." Twice as much rainfall as normal in this year's monsoon season has turned rivers into lakes, submerging towns, farms and roads.
Climate scientists broadly agree that temperatures are rising, and that this is increasing atmospheric humidity, which makes heavier or more frequent downpours more likely. However scientists say it is difficult to pinpoint the cause of any specific extreme weather event, or to definitively attribute it to climate change.
Pakistan, which is in the throes of an economic crisis that has chipped away at its reserves, has appealed for international help to help those displaced by the rains. An assessment of needs is being prepared with the United Nations, said Ms. Rehman.
"Thousands are without shelter, many are without food. And people are stranded," Ms. Rehman said. "We need all the help we can get."
In the monsoon deluge, 913 people have died, and a further 1,296 have been injured since mid-June, the country's climate change ministry said, making this year's the deadliest flooding since 2010.

ANGOLA
President Lourenco
Set for Another Term
Angola's ruling party, already in power for nearly five decades, was set to narrowly win this week's general election, the country's electoral commission said Thursday, handing President Joao Lourenco another five-year term.
With 97% of ballots counted, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, was at 51% of the vote in Wednesday's elections, the commission said, the party's slimmest margin since Angola held its first national elections in 1992. The opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, won 44%, the commission said, with the remainder of the votes going to smaller parties.
The near-final results would leave the MPLA with 124 out of the 220 seats in Angola, enough to elect Mr. Lourenco for a second term, while Unita would have 90 seats.
As early results were released throughout the day Thursday, Unita officials contested the electoral commission's numbers and said its parallel count pointed to an opposition victory. "Don't let them steal our hope," the party's leader, Adalberto Costa Junior, who had joined forces for the election with two other popular opposition groups, posted on Facebook.

BANGLADESH
Rohingya Mark the
5th Year as Refugees
Hundreds of thousands of ethnic minority Rohingya refugees marked the fifth anniversary of their exodus from Myanmar to Bangladesh on Thursday, as the U.S., the European Union and other Western nations pledged to support the pursuit of justice in international courts.
At a sprawling camp in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, thousands of refugees gathered to commemorate what they term Genocide Remembrance Day, with speakers demanding safety from persecution inside Myanmar so they can return to the country.
On Thursday, the United Kingdom announced a further round of sanctions targeting businesses linked to Myanmar's military, which rules the country.
More than one million Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar over several decades, including about 740,000 who crossed the border starting in August 2017 when the Myanmar military launched a "clearance operation" against them following attacks by a rebel group.
In March, the U.S. said the oppression of Rohingya in Myanmar amounts to genocide.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The tax-and-climate bill passed by Congress offers tax breaks and rebates to encourage more Americans to buy energy-efficient heating and cooling systems and other products, which has manufacturers anticipating a sales surge.
The bill, which President Biden signed Tuesday, is the largest investment in energy efficiency in U.S. history, with more than $21 billion allocated for rebates and federal tax deductions for household energy-saving upgrades over the next 10 years.
"The world is getting hotter -- 9 of the last 10 years rank among the 10 warmest on record, which drives increased demand for energy-efficient air conditioning," said David Gitlin, chief executive of Carrier Global Corp., a top U.S. manufacturer of air-conditioning systems, in an emailed statement. "Tax credits and incentives encourage consumers to make more climate friendly choices."
Anticipating an increase in sales, Mark Kuntz, chief executive of Mitsubishi Electric Trane HVAC US Inc., which makes high-efficiency heat pumps, said the company plans to announce the location of a new 2,000-worker factory by the end of the year on expectations of higher sales. "We think it's going to change the mind-set of the U.S. consumer," he said of the bill, called the Inflation Reduction Act. He said the new factory could potentially be located in the U.S.
The most immediate incentive available to consumers is a federal tax credit, which would allow buyers to deduct up to 30% of energy-saving purchases starting Jan. 1. For air conditioners, water heaters, furnaces or boilers, purchasers can deduct $600 per appliance. It also offers credits for doors, windows and insulation.
The so-called 25C tax credit was first made available by Congress in 2005 but has lapsed several times. The most recent credit, which expired Dec. 31, was far less generous: It typically allowed buyers a one-time deduction of 10% of the cost, up to $500.
Under the bill, the expanded tax credit would last 10 years, signaling to manufacturers steady demand and breaking them from past cycles of advertising in bursts before incentives expire, said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Having such generous incentives in place for a longer period could help increase the presence of efficient products in the standard mix of inventory that contractors have on hand for consumers who are making emergency purchases when their system goes out, Mr. Ungar said. "It's not just about making these products available," he said. "It's about making these products the default so the contractor will say, 'Yeah, I've got this on my truck.'"
Energy-efficiency advocates and trade groups alike say the incentives could nudge consumers who have had plenty of reasons to put off buying new appliances if their existing ones haven't stopped working.
"Anytime you're going to offer rebates and other incentives for the purchase of specific equipment, you're going to increase sales," said Francis Dietz, spokesman for the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute.
The size of the climate bill's subsidies and tax breaks for high-efficiency household appliances, along with other provisions for home builders, renters and commercial-building operators, dwarf the value of previous federal efforts, including those included in the 2005 Energy Policy Act and 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
The Inflation Reduction Act would raise $739 billion in revenue, spend $433 billion -- of which about $370 billion is for energy and climate -- and pare the budget deficit by roughly $300 billion over a decade, according to figures released by Senate Democrats.
The spending and subsidies for energy-efficient systems and appliances are too small to have emerged as a lightning rod for criticism from conservative groups, but are part of a larger spending package that some Republicans worry will overheat the U.S. economy and waste taxpayer money.
The climate measures, if fully implemented, could cut U.S. emissions of methane, carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases by 37% to 41% compared with 2005 levels, according to San Francisco-based research group Energy Innovation.
While the biggest reductions would come from renewable-power-generation projects, the consumer incentives, along with tax credits for electric vehicles and rooftop solar panels, give the average person a way to combat climate change.
"We've been talking about climate change, but Americans haven't been given the support to be a part of that solution," said Kara Saul-Rinaldi, president of AnnDyl Policy Group, an environmental and energy lobbying and strategy firm.
The climate bill's provisions will cut the typical U.S. household's energy bill by $112 a year by 2030, both because of households that install higher-efficiency equipment and buy electric vehicles and because of projected lower energy prices, according to an analysis from Rhodium Group research firm.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Farmers' conservation efforts will get a funding boost from the climate, healthcare and tax package President Biden is expected to sign into law.
The legislation, passed along party lines in both chambers, allots roughly $20 billion over 10 years to help more farmers and ranchers participate in popular conservation programs run by the Agriculture Department.
The bill has drawn mixed reviews from food and agricultural trade groups, with the American Farm Bureau Federation and others objecting to some of the tax increases used to pay for the package. Some trade groups have criticized provisions they said will raise taxes on many farmers and ranchers and could make food and other supplies more expensive for restaurants.
The programs, which currently have long waiting lists, incentivize and help farmers to use environmentally friendly practices to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and bolster the health of their land, such as expanding the planting of cover crops between harvests to improve soil quality.
Some programs help farmers and ranchers plan and implement new projects, while others set up partnerships between farmers and other groups, including nonprofits.
"We are taking proven programs that make smart investments," Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.), who leads the House Agriculture Committee's conservation panel, said in an interview before House passage of the bill Friday. "These really beneficial, tested programs are receiving major investments in this bill as part of our effort to fight climate change."
GOP lawmakers objected to funding the conservation programs in this legislation. The programs are typically funded in the farm bill, a multiyear package that sets federal farm policy and funding for nutrition benefits, which usually draws strong bipartisan support.
Crafting the farm bill "requires a lot of discussion and a lot of give and take," Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) said in an interview. Lawmakers weigh the funding needs for supporting farmers, conservation and nutrition programs, he said. "You blow up that balance -- I think it really doesn't bode well for farm bills going forward," he said.
Supporters said the funding will help compensate farmers and ranchers for some of the steps many are already taking.
"There's more demand for the programs than there is money to go around," said Paul Bleiberg, senior vice president at the National Milk Producers Federation, which lauded the increase in conservation funding.
The bill instructs the Agriculture Department to give priority to "climate-smart" practices in allocating the new funds, including reducing methane emissions from cattle's belching through efforts such as changes to their diet. Cattle, along with other farm animals, contribute more than one-quarter of the country's methane emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The package also directs $14 billion to help rural communities transition to cleaner energy sources; $5 billion to forestry programs; and $4 billion to combat drought.

Wall Street Bets on Green Energy, Fossil Fuel

Full text: The climate-and-energy legislation that Congress passed includes spending for both renewables startups and fossil-fuel producers -- a seemingly contradictory, strategy that many on Wall Street are already pursuing.
While pouring money into projects geared toward lowering carbon emissions, Wall Street firms continue financing oil-and-gas companies through direct lending, debt underwriting or infrastructure investing. The amount of money raised through bonds and loans for green projects and by oil-and-gas companies was nearly identical at about $570 billion last year, according to Dealogic. Although fundraising in both areas slowed during this year's market volatility, the ratio of green-to-fossil-fuel financing stayed roughly similar.
Fully avoiding fossil-fuel investments is impractical, many investors say, because oil, gas and coal account for about 80% of the world's energy. Energy and food shortages driven by the war in Ukraine hammered home that reality while highlighting the risks of haphazard shifts away from fossil fuels in some European countries.
The bill passed Friday by the House of Representatives appears to take a similar tack. Principal backer Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and others dubbed it an "all-in energy policy."
That philosophy is being reflected in many investment portfolios, even among those who want to direct money to address climate-change risks.
"The answer is not either-or," said Megan Starr, global head of impact at private-equity firm Carlyle Group Inc., which said it would work with portfolio companies such as Madrid-based Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA -- known as Cepsa -- and Colombian oil-and-gas producer SierraCol Energy to bring down emissions. "It's all of the above."
Officially part of what is called the Inflation Reduction Act, the energy spending package is expected to be signed into law by President Joe Biden this week. The legislation uses tax credits in hope of spurring investments in electric vehicles, renewable energy and batteries. Provisions supporting new oil-and-gas leases and tax credits for nascent technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen are aimed at bolstering investments in those areas.
Republicans have said the legislation will hurt the economy. Some oil-industry trade groups criticized tax increases for leaks of methane and other provisions. The bill is seen by many as a boon for the largest fossil-fuel companies, banks and investment firms that have the money to back all types of energy projects.
There is criticism that the legislation doesn't do enough and that more aggressive action will be needed to meet climate goals.
"We are getting to a point where it's inconceivable that you can continue to have your cake and eat it, too," said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a climate adviser to the United Nations secretary-general.
Still, many climate investors support the legislation's mixed approach because they think it will level the playing field between renewables and fossil fuels, let markets decide what solutions to favor and lower emissions over time.
Funds designed to address environmental, social and governance concerns and which are managed by giant asset managers such as BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. hold shares of oil-and-gas companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. That is to maintain some investments across industries and avoid missing out when oil-and-gas assets outpace the market, as they have for much of the year.
Some investors say working with energy firms to lower emissions is one of the best ways they can fight climate change. Some firms such as BP PLC and Shell PLC are major players in renewables, including wind and solar. Many investors are betting oil-and-gas companies will become leaders in new areas such as renewable fuels and storing carbon underground.
It isn't just Wall Street betting on a gradual transition. Many clean-energy startups also plan to use natural gas for several years and are backed by established energy and utility companies.
"You can't just switch overnight," said Shannon Miller, CEO of Mainspring Energy Inc., which sells cleaner power generators that can run on different energy sources including natural gas, hydrogen and ammonia.
Mainspring partners with utilities such as NextEra Energy Inc. and American Electric Power Co. and counts Bill Gates among its investors.
The bill could help Wall Street meet its clean-energy spending commitments. Reports from groups such as the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change concluded banks aren't doing enough to meet their climate goals.
Bank executives say they can do only so much as financial intermediaries subject to broader business trends. Selling fossil-fuel assets or ending profitable business relationships that will be taken over by smaller financial firms doesn't benefit the climate, they argue.
Private conversations with companies and technological breakthroughs resulting from their investments often aren't captured in climate assessments, they say.

Full text: A group of U.S. lawmakers flew to Taiwan on Sunday to meet Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, the latest development to raise questions about U.S. intentions regarding the island's relationship with China.
The visit is likely to rekindle tensions after China encircled the island with live-fire military drills in response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit this month.
The bipartisan congressional delegation, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Ed Markey (D., Mass.), plans to spend two days on the island and is expected to also meet with senior Taiwanese government and private-sector leaders to discuss U.S.-Taiwan relations, regional security, global supply chains and climate change.
"The delegation will reaffirm the United States' support for Taiwan," a spokesperson for Mr. Markey said, adding the lawmakers would "encourage stability and peace across the Taiwan Strait. "
Taiwan's Presidential Office said the lawmakers would be meeting with Ms. Tsai on Monday. "At a time when China continues to escalate regional tensions, the U.S. Congress once again organized a heavyweight delegation to visit Taiwan to demonstrate friendship without fear of China's threats," Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said, noting that the delegation would also meet with Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.
In protesting the visit, Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said the U.S. had "spared no effort to stir up confrontation" between Beijing and Taipei.
The trip is among developments that have raised tension over prior U.S. commitments to limit ties with Taiwan amid China's goal of a political union with the island. It couldn't be determined whether Mr. Markey's trip was coordinated with the U.S. House speaker's office or the Biden administration. The National Security Council, which advises the White House on foreign policy and national-security matters, didn't respond to a request for comment.
A person familiar with the matter said the trip has been planned for several months and that the China exercises following Mrs. Pelosi's trip didn't deter the lawmakers' plans. President Biden didn't speak with Mrs. Pelosi ahead of her trip, an official said previously.
The trip's first stop was South Korea, though the U.S. House members in the delegation missed that part of the trip because of last week's reconciliation-bill vote.
The visit comes barely two weeks after Mrs. Pelosi spent two days in Taiwan as part of an Asian tour to meet allies that sparked a furious response from Beijing. Mrs. Pelosi, long a strident critic of China's human-rights record, became the most senior U.S. politician in more than 25 years to visit.
Beijing responded to Mrs. Pelosi's trip by launching missiles over Taiwan, sending warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and simulating a blockade of Taiwan with military exercises near the island. Beijing also suspended climate talks with the U.S. and cut off some forms of military-to-military communication.
China's Communist Party considers Taiwan a part of China and has vowed to take control of the democratically self-ruled island, by force if necessary. Ties between Taipei and Washington have grown tighter in recent years, stirring anxiety in China.
Beijing is concerned that Mrs. Pelosi's visit could trigger a "domino effect" of other world politicians traveling to Taipei, which would boost its international standing, potentially encouraging it to formally declare independence, people with knowledge of Chinese thinking said.
Beijing announced an end to drills around Taiwan on Wednesday but said it would continue to conduct regular patrols of the Taiwan Strait. On Friday, the White House's China coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said the U.S. would likewise send ships through the strait.
Sunday's delegation also included House members John Garamendi (D., Calif.), Alan Lowenthal (D., Calif.), Don Beyer (D., Virginia) and Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen (R., American Samoa).

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The House passed a climate and healthcare bill Friday that will soon head to President Biden's desk, the culmination of a yearlong push Democrats hope will motivate their voters in the midterm elections but that Republicans cast as harmful government overreach.
The party-line 220-207 vote comes less than a week after the Senate passed the measure. It imposes new taxes on large, profitable corporations, spends $87 billion over a decade on new workers and technology at the Internal Revenue Service, caps insulin costs for Medicare recipients, puts Medicare on course to negotiate drug prices and funds hundreds of billions in tax subsidies intended to combat climate change.
"This is a substantive policy achievement," said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D., Mass.). He acknowledged there was "perhaps a bigger version," but said "you carve out victories as you can get them."
Republicans said the bill, named the Inflation Reduction Act, would do little to tamp down price increases. They said the new taxes would ultimately hit ordinary Americans by squeezing companies that could otherwise raise wages or add jobs, just as the economy is slowing.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said the tax increases would hurt businesses, put ordinary Americans under the scrutiny of tax agents, and discourage drugmakers from developing new medicines in the service of giving tax breaks to wealthy buyers of electric vehicles.
"A vote for this bill is a vote to help the well-connected get further and further ahead, while leaving the needs of hard-working American families behind," he said.
Mr. Biden said the measure would lower costs for prescription drugs, healthcare and energy. "Today, the American people won. Special interests lost," he said in a tweet after passage.
The package is the end result of stop-and-go work on the bill that started last year. An initial $3.5 trillion vision was whittled down to roughly $2 trillion. That bill, dubbed Build Back Better, passed the House, only to be blocked in the Senate by centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.). Talks between Mr. Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) yielded a deal leading to the final package.
While the bill is far smaller than they originally envisioned, House Democrats have largely united behind it, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and leaders of the progressive and other wings of the party announcing their support.
The bill, before some last-minute changes in the Senate version, was set to raise a total of $739 billion in revenue over 10 years and spend a total of $433 billion. The Congressional Budget Office hasn't released a revised score of the package's final language.
Along with a new 15% corporate minimum tax, the bill creates a 1% excise tax on companies' stock buybacks and sets aside roughly $300 billion for reducing the deficit.
Mr. Biden said on Twitter that he would sign the bill into law next week, and that he would hold a celebratory event at the White House on Sept. 6. It is the latest in a string of legislation passed by Congress, including a bipartisan law to boost investments in semiconductors and the first significant gun-violence measure in decades.
The bolstered funding for the IRS has been particularly contentious in recent days. Treasury officials say many of the 87,000 new IRS staffers will replace more than 50,000 employees set to retire over the next decade and serve in a variety of roles, not just tax collection. The Democrats' goal is to crack down on tax avoidance by wealthy taxpayers, with higher expected revenue used to pay down the deficit and fund healthcare and climate programs.
But Republicans have pointed to the IRS funding as overreach by the administration, saying ordinary Americans of all income levels could be subject to intrusive and expensive audits.
On healthcare, the bill's most immediate effects will start next year, when people on Medicare will see their insulin costs capped at $35 a month, seniors will be eligible to receive certain vaccines free and people who received Affordable Care Act subsidies through the 2021 American Rescue Plan will be able to count on another three years of those benefits. Other consumer-friendly benefits won't start for years, with a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare enrollees starting in 2025 and Medicare able to negotiate prices on a narrow set of 10 drugs starting in 2026, potentially expanding to 20 medicines in 2029.
The drug industry said allowing the government to negotiate on price would deter innovation by reducing the money available to develop new and cutting-edge treatments.
On climate, the package includes hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for investing in renewable-energy projects and producing energy from renewable sources, and credits to help factories retool to turn out electric vehicles or other products needed in a low-carbon economy. It also includes tax credits to help homeowners upgrade their homes with more energy-efficient products. It gives a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, although with conditions that could makeit hard to qualify.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Legislation to speed the approval process for energy infrastructure projects is facing political headwinds, including from Republicans who are skeptical of assurances it will help the fossil-fuel industry and don't like how it was tied to the tax-and-climate bill passed by Senate Democrats.
Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) negotiated the deal as companion legislation to the climate bill, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, saying it would include measures to reduce yearslong delays common in permitting both clean-energy and fossil-fuel infrastructure, especially pipelines.
The tax-and-climate plan was approved by the Senate on Sunday in a so-called reconciliation bill that required a simple 51-vote majority. But the permitting legislation wouldn't qualify as a reconciliation measure, meaning Democrats will need at least some Republican support to get the 60 votes for Senate passage under its rules for other legislation.
Senate Republicans already are signaling that they will seek to block an attempt by Democrats to attach the proposal to must-pass budget legislation Democrats are queuing up for late September.
That measure, known as a continuing resolution, is needed to ensure the government has funding for its obligations beyond the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.
Though many Republicans have long supported streamlining permits to reduce bureaucratic delays to new energy projects, party leaders are upset over the tax-and-climate bill it is linked to, which raises some corporate taxes and allots nearly $370 billion to address climate change.
As part of an effort to defeat the tax-and-climate bill, they are pushing to kill the permitting deal, which Mr. Manchin had negotiated in return for his support on the main climate bill. On Friday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) also said he is encouraging other Republicans tooppose the permitting legislation unless they each get similar concessions to Mr. Manchin's.
"I will not vote for a continuing resolution that's part of a political payback scheme," Mr. Graham said at a press conference, adding that Republicans should ask Democrats for special concessions for each of their states. "If they won't do that, we should have a continuing resolution that's clean," without other measures tacked on.
Mr. Manchin said he has support for the bill to streamline permitting from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and President Biden. But some Republicans are skeptical Democrats will come through on significant improvements.
"I don't think West Virginians trust the likes of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Biden to follow through on a plan that would expand drilling, build pipelines or decrease regulations," Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) wrote recently in the Charleston Gazette-Mail. "And, given their track record, I can't either."
Top Senate Democrats are betting Republicans will back down, since a vote against the continuing resolution could trigger a government shutdown weeks before national midterm elections, according to a senior Democratic aide in Congress.
In a radio interview on Thursday, Mr. Manchin said Republicans have long supported streamlining permits for energy infrastructure.
"I guess if my Republican friends want to say we are going to send a political jolt and just show them, they're going to shut down the government because of this legislation . . . [but] it's everything they ever wanted," he said.
Democrats also are facing some resistance to the measure. The Sunrise Movement, one of several climate activist groups that have become a force in the Democratic Party, opposes new oil and gas pipelines and is urging Democrats to carefully weigh the implications.
"As they consider the permitting process, they must uphold their mandate to stick up for folks in communities choked by fossil-fuel infrastructure," said the group's national spokesman, John Paul Mejia. "We will continue to stand with our partner movements on the front lines to oppose new fossil-fuel infrastructure."
The Senate passed the bill on a 51-50 vote during a marathon weekend session, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Democrats' expected passage of their climate, healthcare and tax bill draws a clear line with Republicans headed into the midterms, with the parties now laying out competing economic visions for voters who will decide control of the House and Senate.
Democrats say the Inflation Reduction Act provides much needed investment in cleaner energy and lowers healthcare costs, while the GOP says the bill will pinch small businesses while subsidizing electric cars for wealthy Americans and do nothing to cut households' bills. The Senate passed the package Sunday along party lines, and House Democrats are expected to approve it Friday, sending it to President Biden's desk.
One source of uncertainty is the FBI's search of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence, with political strategists cautioning it is too early to predict how that could affect midterm races.
The climate, tax and healthcare legislation offers tax incentives for reducing carbon emissions, seeks to allow Medicare to negotiate the price of some prescription drugs, allots roughly $80 billion to sharply increase the size and enforcement abilities of the Internal Revenue Service and extends subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. It mandates a new 15% corporate minimum tax andcreates a 1% excise tax on companies' stock buybacks.
"We are fighting for mainstream values, affordable healthcare, jobs that pay a decent wage, combating climate change; and they are fighting for extreme positions and fielding extreme candidates," said Tom Perez, former Democratic National Committee chairman and co-chairman of the super PAC American Bridge 21st Century.
"Democrats spent us into inflation, then raised taxes in a recession, and sent an army of IRS agents to harass your business for good measure," said Jack Pandol, spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) touted the reconciliation bill as one piece of a larger set of legislative victories, including bipartisan measures to fund veterans' healthcare, curb gun violence, boost domestic chip production, and admit Finland and Sweden to NATO -- all passed within the past month and a half.
In an interview on MSNBC Monday, Mr. Schumer said that voters had been wondering whether Democrats could get anything done if they keep control of Congress. "I think the last six weeks. . .and particularly this recent bill, answer with a resounding 'yes,'" he said. In an interview Thursday on Sirius XM radio, he predicted that the Democrats would pick up two or three Senate seats if the election were held today, allowing them to pursue spending programs left out of their bill, such as child care.
Mr. Schumer has said he would force Republicans to vote again on capping insulin costs at $35 a month. Most Senate Republicans voted to strip a provision out of Democrats' bill that would have capped costs at $35 for patients with private insurance, after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that it didn't comply with Senate rules for advancing legislation under the reconciliation process. The cap remains in the bill for Medicare recipients.
Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who voted to strip out the insulin price cap, complained it was a "gotcha" vote, as under Senate rules the provision shouldn't have been included in the legislation. "The Dems wanted to break Senate rules to pass insulin pricing cap instead of going through regular order," tweeted Mr. Johnson, who is running for re-election in a state Mr. Biden won in 2020. "They put this in a bill it wasn't allowed in, all for show."
Senate Democrats used reconciliation to pass the package with just a simple majority, rather than the 60 typically required. Under reconciliation, provisions have to be closely tied to the federal budget.
Democratic super PACs, issue advocacy groups and candidates already are airing ads focused on the insulin cap in battleground states Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, in both English and Spanish.
Republicans, for their part, see the broad expansion of the IRS as a key election issue. Some Republicans have tried to link it to the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago, as another example of the Biden administration's overreach.
"If they will weaponize the FBI to go after President Trump, they will surely weaponize the IRS's 87,000 new agents to go after you," tweeted Rep. Andrew Clyde (R., Ga.).
In Ohio, where Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan is vying with Republican author J.D. Vance for an open Senate seat, the candidates clashed this week over the bill's electric-vehicle tax credits and IRS measures.
"I don't buy that anything that's good for Joe Biden is actually good for people that I'm hoping to represent," Mr. Vance said on Fox Business. "Democrats have rejected calls and laws that would make sure those IRS agents don't go after small and medium-size businesses in my state. This is a disaster."
A political nonprofit group affiliated with the Senate Leadership Fund launched a $3.8 million ad campaign in Ohio that blames Mr. Ryan's support of Democrats' legislative agenda for "sending inflation through the roof and raising gas and grocery prices" on Ohioans.
One Nation is funding similar ads in battleground states Arizona, Nevada, New Hampshire and Georgia, attempting to tie the "Reckless Reconciliation Package" to inflation.
Mr. Ryan defended the reconciliation bill in a statement, saying the bill will "bring down inflation and slash the deficit, cut healthcare costs for working Ohioans and create new good-paying jobs" in the electric-vehicle industry.

Core Issues Appear
To Energize Voters
Democrats have been fighting an uphill battle to keep control of Congress, with nonpartisan groups predicting double-digit pickups by Republicans in the House. But the recent Supreme Court ruling ending federal abortion rights, along with several recent policy victories, appears to have energized voters and improved Democrats' prospects. Earlier this month, Kansas voters soundly rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have ended protections for abortion.
The parties are now neck-and-neck in public polling over who voters want in control of Congress, closing a two-point advantage for Republicans that stood for much of the past year, according to aggregator Five Thirty Eight. Typically, Democrats need to be ahead in this measure by several percentage points to win the chamber.
Election watcher Dave Wasserman pointed to special elections Tuesday night, when Republicans won House seats in Minnesota and Nebraska, but the margin was narrower than expected.
"There's still time for things to snap back before November, but we're no longer living in a political environment as pro-GOP as November 2021," tweeted Mr. Wasserman, the U.S. House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Democrats pushed forward with a revised climate and tax agreement, sorting through a final set of procedural questions on the bill's measures and preparing for a lengthy amendment process ahead of a final Senate vote that could happen as soon as this weekend.
After yielding to demands of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) on the bill's tax provisions, Democrats now believe they are on track to finally pass a party-line economic package through the evenly divided chamber. Senate passage of the bill, which raises roughly $750 billion in taxes and spends about $430 billion on healthcare and energy provisions, would be the culmination of start-stop talks on the legislation that have lasted all of this year.
"This is a very, very, very big deal," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said during a news conference Friday. He said he had spoken to every member of his caucus and believed they were all on board.
Senate Democrats are expected to take up an initial procedural vote on the bill on Saturday. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said that the House would reconvene to consider the legislation on Friday, Aug. 12. If the bill passes Congress, it will go to President Biden's desk for his signature.
To secure Ms. Sinema's commitment to move forward with the agreement, the product of secret talks between Mr. Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), Democrats agreed to make a series of late changes to the package. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats need to stay united in the face of unified Republican opposition, giving individual centrists such as Ms. Sinema and Mr. Manchin enormous sway over the policy agenda.
Late Thursday night, Democrats said they agreed to drop a provision that would have raised taxes on private-equity managers' carried-interest income, generating $14 billion in revenue over 10 years. Ms. Sinema repeatedly told lobbyists and donors over the last year that she opposes tightening taxes on carried interest.
Mr. Schumer said Friday that Democrats dropped the provision because Ms. Sinema said she wouldn't allow the party to move the legislation past the initial procedural vote if it remained in the bill. "We had no choice," Mr. Schumer said. Ms. Sinema hasn't committed to voting for the final bill, saying she will evaluate it after any final potential changes.
Democrats also pared back elements of a 15% minimum tax on large, profitable corporations. Instead of denying manufacturers the tax benefits of accelerated depreciation, the new agreement will preserve it for at least some manufacturers.
Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), who was involved in the talks with Ms. Sinema, said preserving the accelerated depreciation tax benefit will help manufacturers that Congress is already trying to encourage to build production capacity in the U.S.
Ms. Sinema "made a good point that if we're trying to incent someone to build an electric battery plant here but then take away other tools in the tax code around depreciation, isn't that contradictory?" he said.
Because Democrats are seeking to reduce the deficit by roughly $300 billion in the legislation, a key demand of Mr. Manchin, the party agreed to add a new tax to the legislation to make up for the lost revenue from paring back other provisions. They added a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks that Mr. Schumer said would raise roughly $74 billion in tax revenue over 10 years.
The revised corporate minimum tax will bring in $258 billion over a decade after the changes, Mr. Schumer said, down from the $313 billion it had earlier been estimated to generate in revenue.
A group of Democratic senators from Western states said Friday that the deal would also include $4 billion in funding to combat drought.
Beyond those provisions, the bill includes a series of tax incentives for companies and individuals to take steps to reduce carbon emissions, as well as support for fossil-fuel energy production. It empowers the government to allow Medicare to begin negotiating a lower price for some prescription drugs and extends subsidies for health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act.
It would also increase funding for the Internal Revenue Service, money that will go toward tax collection efforts at the agency.
Republicans are set to unanimously oppose the package, arguing the tax increases would damage the economy at a time when it already is at risk of entering a recession. They also say Democratic spending plans have fueled inflation.
"The Democrats are at it again -- trying to raise taxes and increase government spending at a time of high inflation and a time of recession," Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.) said Friday.
Republicans have the opportunity to try to change the bill during a marathon amendment process this weekend, with some Democrats warning against supporting any GOP tweaks that could endanger the bill's support in the caucus. Some lawmakers have in particular said the party should not approve any changes to immigration policy during the amendment process, often referred to as a vote-a-rama.
Democrats will also have to contend with the possibility of last-minute changes for procedural reasons.
To avoid the 60-vote threshold necessary for most legislation in the Senate and pass the bill with a simple majority in the Senate, Democrats are pursuing a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation requires the bill's measures to be directly related to the budget, and provisions that the Senate's nonpartisan parliamentarian considers to be incidental to the budget could be removed.
Among the measures at possible risk of change because of reconciliation's rules are proposed taxes on drugmakers that don't comply with lower negotiated prices and measures to tie tax credits for electric-vehicles to the place of manufacture and the origin of its components.
If the bill passes and becomes law, it marks an achievement for Democrats in the months before the midterm elections after more than a year of failed efforts to unify around elements of Mr. Biden's agenda. Democrats had originally envisioned a far more ambitious program, outlining a $3.5 trillion plan last year that would have offered free community college, an expanded child tax credit and expanding eligibility for Medicare, among many other steps.
Many of those ambitions will remain unfulfilled with this bill, but many Democrats are encouraged to have reached any sort of agreement before the midterm elections, when they could lose control of Congress.
"I think this is a really good product," Mr. Warner said. "Looking back, that was probably too ambitious. The idea that we were going to solve all of the country's pent-up issues in one bill was probably a bridge too far."

Full text: Investors were already returning to clean-tech and renewable-power stocks when the proposed $369 billion Senate energy and climate-spending package jolted the sector to its best week in 18 months.
Private investors who continued to pour cash into speculative industries like green hydrogen and carbon capture during the stock-market downturn earlier in the year would be among the biggest beneficiaries of tax subsidies that are part of the bill. Renewable energy and battery producers would get the certainty of tax credits that would last for a decade, which they say will encourage investment.
The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF rose nearly 15% for the week, buoyed by gains in companies like solar-panel manufacturer First Solar Inc. and hydrogen producer Plug Power Inc. It marked the best week for the sector since its peak in January 2021, when clean-tech stocks soared along with everything from cryptocurrencies to meme stocks like GameStop Corp.
Bellwether stocks such as electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. and utility NextEra Energy Inc. also rallied. Stocks like these were already rebounding because of a drop in government-bond yields amid expectations that rates would start falling next year. Rising costs, high valuations and supply-chain snarls have buffeted clean-energy stocks in the past year.
"I'm breathing a sigh of relief," said Veronica Zhang, a deputy portfolio manager at investment firm VanEck who helps run its environmental sustainability fund. "It's a significant shift from all the doldrums we've been dealing with."
The proposed bill put forth by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) included tax incentives aimed at channeling billions of dollars to wind, solar and battery-storage projects that put clean power onto the U.S. grid.
Big investors including top private-equity firms and players focused on green energy have increased their stakes in promising startups despite the industry downturn. Some firms are sitting on big, newly raised funds and targeting industries from established solar developers to battery startups.
The bill was designed to expand the U.S.'s energy independence with provisions to increase fossil-fuel production and to bolster domestic supply chains for products like batteries and solar panels.
If the bill passes, First Solar would evaluate expanding its U.S. manufacturing, Chief Executive Mark Widmar said on the company's Thursday earnings call. First Solar, which is building new plants in Ohio and India, said previously that uncertainty about U.S. tax and tariff policy had made it challenging to make domestic investments. Shares ended the week up more than 35%. Other solar companies that make parts or install projects, such as Enphase Energy Inc. and SunPower Corp., also surged.
The spending bill could provide the biggest boost to speculative industries that produce hydrogen using renewable energy and capture carbon. The bill would provide funding to producers of hydrogen -- which is seen as a potential replacement for fossil fuels in some industries.
Efforts to produce green hydrogen and remove carbon from the atmosphere have for years failed to become economical and to reach the scale necessary to limit climate change.
Most hydrogen is produced today from natural gas for uses in chemical refining and to make ammonia, a key input for fertilizers. Many big fossil-fuel companies have proposed capturing the carbon from those operations to lower emissions. Others, such as Plug Power, hope to produce so-called green hydrogen by using machines called electrolyzers that run on renewable power to split water. Plug Power's shares rose more than 20% this week.
The bill would help keep jobs in states including Wyoming, New Mexico and Sen. Manchin's home state of West Virginia that would otherwise have gone overseas, Australian billionaire and mining magnate Andrew Forrest said through a spokeswoman. The renewable-energy unit of the Australian mining company he founded, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., has proposed U.S. clean hydrogen projects that would repurpose infrastructure previously used for coal power.
Both hydrogen and carbon capture are favorite green projects for fossil-fuel producers because they either use their infrastructure and know-how, or reduce emissions from the burning of their products. The bill would give tax credits to carbon captured from existing operations, removed directly from the air and stored, with the biggest ones going to companies that permanently store the carbon and with other credits for reusing the carbon. Scientists say vast amounts of carbon capture and direct removal from the air are needed to limit global warming despite worries that the practices could extend the use of fossil fuels.
Some executives in areas like energy storage said they have already been getting more inquiries since the bill was introduced.
"It is a really important signal to the market and companies like ours," said Geoff Brown, CEO of battery-storage company Powin LLC, which recently privately raised $135 million from investors.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are moving forward on the costliest and most ambitious effort ever by the U.S. to address climate change -- powered in part by benefits for fossil fuels and the broader energy industry.
The proposed $369 billion compromise bill struck by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) includes tax incentives aimed at channeling billions of dollars to wind, solar and battery developments that put clean power onto the grid.
At the insistence of Mr. Manchin, the legislative package provides support for traditional sources of energy like oil, gas and coal along with nuclear power. There are tax subsidies for plants that capture the carbon emissions from burning those fossil fuels, and others for producing hydrogen, often done with natural gas.
Even expanding offshore wind and solar-power development on federal land would now require the federal government to offer more access for drilling on federal territory.
Mr. Schumer met behind closed doors Thursday with his caucus to press the case for the package, while acknowledging Democrats had a narrow road to passage with all Republicans opposed.
On Thursday Mr. Manchin called the deal "an all-in energy policy" to boost U.S. energy independence.
Under the bill, the Interior Department would be required to offer up at least two million acres of federal land and 60 million acres of offshore acreage to oil and gas producers every year for the next decade. If they fall short, they wouldn't be able to advance some permitting aspects of the wind and solar projects on federal land. It would be the first-ever required minimum acreage for offshore oil and gas leasing and significantly increase the acreage requirements for onshore leasing.
The compromise deal comes after months of wrangling between Mr. Manchin and other Democratic leaders, including President Biden, over how to balance efforts to curb emissions with an emerging energy crisis and rising inflation. Gasoline, diesel and natural-gas prices all hit all-time highs this year, and U.S. allies in Europe are facing energy shortages in part caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Some environmentalists and liberals in Congress expressed concerns about the provisions Thursday. But more have expressed enthusiastic support, saying the deal is needed in a Senate evenly split between Republicans and Democrats to secure Mr. Manchin's critical vote for costly programs that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
"Tough trade-offs are the only path for getting major climate investments over the finish line," said Sam Ricketts, co-founder of Evergreen Action, a frequent conduit between Mr. Biden and progressives. "And a major investment package like this is absolutely essential to meeting our climate goals."
Mr. Manchin, who has coal-business ties and represents a coal-and-gas state, has said that the U.S. needs to ensure its supply of domestic energy while the renewables industry continues to grow. Many of his allies doubled down on that view after Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed Western countries to find alternatives to Russian oil and gas.
Mr. Manchin has also said he wants to keep the U.S. from becoming dependent on China for batteries, other clean-energy technologies and the minerals needed to build them.
"Putin weaponized energy like no other time I've ever seen," Mr. Manchin said Thursday. "I think [Chinese president] Xi Jinping will do the same with rare-earth minerals."
So while the deal gives subsidies to promote zero-emissions electric vehicles, those would now be tied toward requirements that auto makers use U.S. minerals.
Starting Jan. 1, 2024, for a vehicle to qualify for a tax credit, 40% of the critical minerals in its battery would have to come from either a U.S. mine, a free-trade country or a U.S. facility that recycles minerals, a practice that isn't widespread.
To boost domestic energy, the bill includes a new per-kilowatt-hour production tax credit for nuclear power to staunch the closing of nuclear plants.
For the oil industry, the bill would also effectively reinstate an 80 million-acre sale for the Gulf of Mexico from last year that a federal judge had invalidated. It was the largest offshore oil-and-gas lease sale in U.S. history -- producing $191 million in bids.
Major oil companies such as Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell PLC that had bid in the offshore auction could quickly benefit. Some have said that lease sales are essential to maintaining their U.S. production.
Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden applauded the deal and highlighted its promise of new lease sales to come. Shell has been investing in new platforms to boost its Gulf operations, and he said production there has to go on.
"The world needs new oil and gas to come on stream," he said. "Just curtailing domestic supply, in the hope that somehow domestic demand will follow suit, is not a realistic policy."
Senate Democrats said the more climate-focused provisions of their bill would reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions 40%. That would help revive Mr. Biden's initiative to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.
If approved by Congress, the bill would be the biggest federal spending package to address climate change. The last similar move spent about $90 billion for clean energy more than a decade ago.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Top Democrats moved to lock down support for a climate, healthcare and tax package and pass it by next week after secret talks between Sens. Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer launched in a Capitol basement suddenly revived much of the party's economic agenda.
Many Democrats are hopeful they can secure an agreement before the midterm elections, after watching many of their policy ambitions for President Biden's first term crumble in the past year. Mr. Schumer, the Senate majority leader, rallied Senate Democrats to quickly unite behind the bill at a closed-door meeting Thursday.
"It will require us to stick together and work long days and nights for the next 10 days," Mr. Schumer said, according to a Democrat inside the meeting. "We will need to be disciplined in our messaging and focus. It will be hard."
Many Democrats signaled their support for the package, but all 50 members of the caucus will need to back the legislation to overcome solid Republican opposition. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.), another centrist who has aired concerns about higher taxes in past talks, didn't immediately commit to the plan. Also, the measure doesn't raise the cap on state and local tax deductions, a priority of some Democrats in the House and Senate.
The package would raise roughly $739 billion, with much of the revenue coming from a 15% corporate minimum tax and enhanced tax enforcement efforts at the Internal Revenue Service, as well as projected savings from allowing Medicare to negotiate some prescription-drug prices.
Of that new revenue, roughly $369 billion would be spent on climate and energy programs, including tax credits for buying electric vehicles, with another $64 billion dedicated to extending healthcare subsidies for three years for some Affordable Care Act users. The bill would dedicate the rest of the new revenue toward reducing the deficit, according to a summary provided by Messrs. Schumer and Manchin.
"This is the most significant action on climate and clean energy that we've ever taken in this country," said Sen. Tina Smith (D., Minn.), a climate hawk in the Senate.
Republicans have rejected the proposal as unneeded government meddling in the economy and said the tax and spending provisions could hurt households and businesses just as inflation remains high and growth is slowing.
On the floor, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) called the legislation a "giant package of huge new job-killing tax hikes, Green New Deal craziness that will kill American energy, and prescription drug socialism."
Messrs. Schumer and Manchin said late Wednesday that they had hammered out the deal, just weeks after talks between the two men had blown up. Mr. Manchin told Mr. Schumer in mid-July that he couldn't support a tax and climate package in August because of his concerns about inflation. After that stance was leaked to news reporters, Democrats considered the climate and tax talks dead and prepared to move forward with a much narrower package only focused on prescription-drug and health-insurance costs.
But within a few days, Mr. Manchin and Mr. Schumer had started talking again after a weekend break.
"By Monday we passed each other, 'Hey, how you doing, you still upset?' " Mr. Manchin recalled. He said he told Mr. Schumer: "This is ridiculous, let's recalibrate and see if something could be done."
Mr. Schumer and his staff were shocked at Mr. Manchin's overture to restart talks, according to a person familiar with the efforts. The two men met that afternoon in a windowless room in the basement of the Capitol to avoid notice and agreed to begin working out policy details again, according to the person.
Mr. Manchin also spoke with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who has been critical of an earlier Democratic spending plan but has backed the new package, according to a person familiar with the matter.
And he drew support from Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.), who met with Mr. Manchin for nearly two hours on the same Monday, days after fellow Democrats began heaping criticism on Mr. Manchin, the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Mr. Manchin tested positive for Covid-19 this week and conducted many of the negotiations over the phone. Mr. Manchin said aides scrubbed the legislation to make sure its measures wouldn't exacerbate inflation, dropping roughly $500 billion in new revenue that had previously been part of the talks.
The negotiations were so closely held that most Senate Democrats hadn't known they were taking place. President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif), who were briefed about the agreement on Wednesday, said they backed the deal, and the House would likely try to vote in August to send any Senate-passed bill to Mr. Biden's desk.
"With this legislation we are facing up to some of our biggest problems and we're taking a giant step forward as a nation," Mr. Biden said in remarks from the White House.
Mr. Manchin said he didn't bring Mr. Biden into the talks. Disagreements with the White House fed a previous blowup in the negotiations last year.
"I didn't think it was fair to bring him in, it very well could not have happened at all," Mr. Manchin said on a West Virginia radio show. "It could have absolutely gone sideways."
Mr. Biden wasn't directly involved in the negotiations, White House officials confirmed.

Full text: Paradise, Calif., the town destroyed by the 2018 Camp Fire, says it is close to a debt default, heightening municipal-bond investors' concerns over how a warming planet is adding risk to their $4 trillion market.
A downed power line sparked the fire, which spread through forested hills baked dry by a lengthy drought. The town received $219 million in settlement money from utility PG&E Corp. in 2020, but Paradise recently disclosed to bondholders that "no assurances can be given" that it will repay about $5 million that one of its agencies borrowed years ago. The agency's cash is close to running out, and local officials have earmarked the settlement funds for reconstruction, not debt repayment. S&P Global Ratings slashed the bonds' rating by six notches to triple-C in June, pushing it deeper into junk territory.
Municipalities have long suffered from weather-related destruction. Many investors are growing more concerned that climate change is intensifying wildfires, even while critical infrastructure is unprepared and underfunded. Bond-fund managers say the mounting cost of such events means state and federal governments will be less willing to bail out creditors when they strike.
The municipal-debt market, which finances community services like schools, hospitals and power plants, is following insurers, real-estate developers and fishing fleets in adapting to the risk. Some bond funds are using artificial intelligence to predict which investments are most likely to get hit by natural disasters.
"A growing subset of investors are comfortable putting their thumbs on scale and saying 'I don't want anything with high climate exposure'," said Adam Stern, co-head of municipal research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors. Accounts focused on sustainable investing have grown fourfold for the firm over the past five years, he said.
Defaulting on the redevelopment agency bonds could taint Paradise's reputation with bond investors in the future, analysts say. The bonds recently traded around 80 cents on the dollar, down from 97 cents in May, according to Electronic Municipal Market Access.
Research firm Municipal Market Analytics hardly ever heard questions from clients about climate change five years ago, said partner Matt Fabian. Now they get questions every week from asset managers, bankers and regulators.
Municipal bond borrowers inconsistently disclose environmental, social and governance factors, making it difficult for portfolio managers to measure their exposure to changing climate.
Historically, municipal investors counted on bond insurers to protect them against events like natural disasters but only about 7.5% of municipal debt outstanding is currently insured, down from over half in 2005, according to a Municipal Market Analytics analysis of Bloomberg data. Many municipalities stopped buying policies after the 2008 financial crisis, when bond insurers lost their AAA credit ratings, causing problems for municipal borrowers.
Private and federal insurers have also pulled back on weather-related coverage, making it harder for devastated towns to rebuild.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden, who has at times expressed reluctance to take executive action to get around gridlock in Congress, is coming under increasing pressure by Democratic lawmakers and activists to make greater use of an authority that some in the party have been skeptical of in the past: emergency powers.
The president is facing calls to declare a public-health emergency to expand access to abortions after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. He is also being pressed to use a national-emergency declaration and other emergency powers to tackle climate-related priorities after they were stripped out of Democrats' budget bill.
Mr. Biden stopped short of formally declaring climate a national emergency during an event Wednesday at a former coal-fired power plant in Massachusetts.
"Let me be clear: Climate change is an emergency," he said. "And in the coming weeks, I'm going to use the power I have as president to turn these words into formal official government actions through the appropriate proclamations, executive orders and regulatory power that the president possesses."
An emergency order can give the president the ability to act faster and with broader discretion than a typical executive order, experts say. Presidents can declare an emergency to help unlock more federal resources under different laws: the National Emergencies Act, Stafford Act, Public Health Service Act and Defense Production Act.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that both actions -- a public-health emergency on abortion and a national emergency on climate -- were under consideration, and that each type of declaration would unlock a different set of authorities and funding. Both steps are opposed by Republicans.
Emergency powers have typically been used in response to natural disasters, health crises, foreign attacks and to impose sanctions against a foreign threat. For example, a public-health emergency to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic was implemented under former President Donald Trump and remains in effect, though Republicans and Democrats have argued over whether that emergency status is still needed.
Presidents from both parties have been accused at times of overstepping their authority with such declarations.
"Emergency powers were never meant to address longstanding problems or to implement long-term or semipermanent solutions," said Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on emergency powers for the Brennan Center for Justice. "The purpose is to give presidents a temporary boost in powers to address problems that Congress can't address quickly or are moving too quickly."
Several climate groups and some members of Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), support declaring a national emergency on climate. The Biden administration had set a goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030, a goal that analysts say the country is now unlikely to meet without swift action. Industry groups and GOP lawmakers have said the steps that environmental groups have pushed for under a climate emergency could raise consumer prices and hurt U.S. energy companies.
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) said recently that if the president moved forward with the emergency, he would be using "made-up powers to circumvent Congress and govern by executive overreach."
The emergency declaration would allow Mr. Biden to take further steps to limit oil exports and drilling, and potentially to shift federal funding to help domestic wind, solar and other clean-technology manufacturing. But it could also open up the administration to legal challenges.
On abortion, the White House has said that declaring a public-health emergency to deal with the Roe ruling is still on the table, but aides have argued that the legal authority and resources it would unlock would be limited. The bulk of the government's existing funding for public-health emergencies has already gone toward tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.
Still, abortion-rights groups, including Planned Parenthood, and several lawmakers have continued to lobby the White House to take that step.

Full text: PARIS -- Fires across France and other countries have turned some of Europe's most popular destinations for summer tourism into tinderboxes and highlighted the struggle to adapt to a changing climate.
Thousands of firefighters, backed by water-carrying jets and helicopters, have been working to tame dozens of blazes across countries including Italy, Spain and Portugal. Wildfires have scorched more than 1.1 million acres in the European Union, vastly more than usual by this time of year, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.
Some of the most intense wildfires are in southwest France. More than 2,000 firefighters have battled two fires there that have destroyed more than 50,000 acres of pine forests and several campsites near the Dune of Pilat, the tallest sand dune in Europe and a popular tourist attraction.
French President Emmanuel Macron was in the area Wednesday visiting firefighters and local officials.
"Many countries that never had big wildfires are seeing an acceleration of the direct consequences of climate change," Mr. Macron said. "This will force us to make structural changes for the years to come."
A government minister said on French TV that the country must spend more on combating wildfires.
Setting the stage for the fires has been a very dry spring in parts of Europe, including France, followed by extreme heat -- conditions that dry out vegetation and make it easier for wildfires to spread. In many parts of the U.K. this week, temperatures hit records.
"It's been a really hard fight -- we've had historically low humidity, very high temperatures, and very strong turning winds," said Remi Lassoureille, a 36-year-old fire captain who has been combating blazes in southwest France all week. "In our generation, we've never seen a fire like this."
Europe has been hit increasingly by extreme weather events in recent years, ranging from floods in Germany to drought in Italy and wildfires in Greece. Scientists have implicated climate change. Average temperatures in Europe rose faster than the global average between 2012 and 2021, a trend that is expected to continue through the end of the century, according to the European Environment Agency.
While this year's fires stem from local weather conditions, including a mass of hot air from Africa -- and fires usually spark from a human cause, such as a power line or cigarette butt -- wildfire-prone conditions have become more common in recent years, and are projected to become even more so, climate experts say.
This year, France has had an early start to what looks to be one of the most severe wildfire seasons on record. More than 36,750 people have evacuated from the Gironde region, where the city of Bordeaux was blanketed in smoke, local authorities said Wednesday.
In Spain, more than 500 firefighters were deployed against 16 major fires Wednesday.

Biden's ESG Tax on Your Retirement Fund

Full text: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in 2020 that "sustainable investing is the strongest foundation for client portfolios." Al Gore said in 2021 that "you don't have to trade values for value. Green can enhance returns." These claims haven't aged well: ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds have trailed the market since the beginning of the year and are badly underperforming the sectors they shun, including oil, gas and coal.
That may spur retirement fund managers to reconsider their commitments to ESG funds. But new ESG-favoring regulations may come to the rescue. Last year the U.S. Labor Department proposed a regulation that would tell retirement-fund managers to consider ESG factors such as "climate change" and "collateral benefits other than investment returns" when investing employees' money.
This would encourage America's perpetually underfunded pension plans to invest in politically correct but unproven ESG strategies. It would also violate retirees' basic right to have their money invested solely to advance their financial interests.
Retirement and pension-fund managers are fiduciaries, legally required to make every investment decision with one purpose -- maximizing retirees' financial interests. The Uniform Prudent Investor Act, a model law adopted by 44 states, makes clear that "no form of so-called 'social investing' " is lawful "if the investment activity entails sacrificing the interests of . . . beneficiaries . . . in favor of the interests . . . supposedly benefitted by pursuing the particular social cause." This principle is built into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act itself, as the Supreme Court held in Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer (2014) . The Biden administration can't change that by regulation.
Trump-era regulations allowed ESG factors to be used as a tiebreaker when a fund manager chooses between two equal investments. This is itself a dubious notion. Law professors Robert Sitkoff and Max Schanzenbach argue that in cases of a tie, fund managers should split available capital between the investments to increase portfolio diversification. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron in May formally issued a legal opinion that investing with "mixed motives" breaches fiduciary duties, suggesting that ties likely can't be legally broken this way.
Amid these concerns, Trump-era regulations applied safeguards against ESG expansionism. Investment managers could call a tie only if they are "unable to distinguish investment alternatives on the basis of pecuniary factors alone." Investment managers must document the basis for such a tie and for selecting particular ESG factors as the tiebreaker.
The Biden administration seeks to remove those limits, allowing fund managers to consider ESG factors whenever they deem two investments "equally serve the financial interests of the plan." Fiduciaries need not document the reason for the tie or how they broke it, the Labor Department explains in announcing the rule, so as to not "chill investments based on climate change or other ESG factors." The department asserts that "two hours of labor to maintain the needed documentation" might prove too onerous for fund managers.
The new rule suggests that fund managers weigh factors such as "climate change," "board composition" and "workforce practices." While the drafters were smart enough not to mandate consideration of ESG factors explicitly, the draft rule's one-sided list of examples tilts the scale in favor of ESG-linked investment selection, proxy voting and shareholder engagement.
The rule states not only that ESG factors can be considered, but that prudent investing "may often require" it. The proposed regulation thus transforms ESG from one factor that may be considered when it has a material effect on the investment to a factor that should be considered in all instances.
The new regulation may also expose fiduciaries who don't consider ESG factors to lawsuits. Already, activist shareholders are pursuing litigation against public companies that don't take ESG-approved steps. NortonLifeLock was sued for allegedly breaching its fiduciary duties by telling investors it was committed to "diversity" when it had no racial minorities on its board. Exxon was sued for allegedly misleading investors by failing to disclose the likely effect of climate change on its bottom line. To date, courts have generally found that no reasonable investor would make investment decisions based on board diversity or, as one judge put it, "speculative assumptions of costs that may be incurred 20+ or 30+ years in the future."
But the Biden administration's proposed rule, and the supplementary guidance provided with it, claims otherwise: "Climate change and other ESG factors are material economic considerations" and can play an "important role . . . in the evaluation and management of plan investments." This language will give fresh ammunition to plaintiff lawyers seeking to wage wasteful litigation against not only American businesses but also plan fiduciaries.
An investment fiduciary must seek to advance the beneficiaries' objectives, not the fiduciary's own values or third-party interests. Doing so requires learning clients' preferences. That is why the Securities and Exchange Commission requires investment advisers to make a "reasonable inquiry into the client's objectives," and also why a recently proposed European Union regulation requires investment firms to collect information from clients on their ESG preferences, including whether clients want to invest in or avoid such products.
If American fund managers asked clients about this, their answers might be very different from what ESG proponents favor. Most Americans disagree that the "collateral benefits" pursued by ESG activists are benefits at all. While ESG activists seek to curtail U.S. energy production, 61% of Americans favor expanding domestic production of natural gas. While ESG activists demand race and sex quotas for corporate boards, 74% of Americans believe that employment decisions should be based on qualifications alone. And while ESG funds often exclude gambling companies from their investments, 80% of Americans support legal sports betting.
Perhaps that is why the drafters of the proposed rule expressly state that it doesn't require a fund manager to consult with beneficiaries before implementing ESG investments.
But the result is a plain violation of fiduciary duty, allowing politicians and fund managers to substitute their investment goals for those of American retirees. Washington should remember that the law governing retirement accounts already spells out the ESG goal that fiduciaries must honor: "Providing a secure retirement for American workers is the paramount and eminently worthy social goal of ERISA plans." The Labor Department should scrap the rule now.

Full text: Governments around the world are offering rich subsidies and incentives to producers of hydrogen energy, which many see as a holy grail. Companies are equally excited: Hundreds of projects worth at least $600 billion have been announced. Estimates suggest demand could increase up to tenfold by midcentury.
But whether and how much a hydrogen revolution helps the climate -- and whether taxpayer and investor money is well spent -- depends on how the gas is produced, managed and used. Avoiding unintended consequences may require hydrogen's advocates to curb their enthusiasm as they follow the science.
Hydrogen production today is dirty and energy-intensive. Methods exist that could virtually eliminate the greenhouse-gas emissions, but there's a more fundamental challenge: Hydrogen itself contributes to climate change when it leaks into the atmosphere.
Scientists have long known that hydrogen triggers indirect warming effects in the atmosphere. As the smallest possible molecule, it is difficult to contain. More, the latest research reveals that -- depending on time frame -- hydrogen's warming power is two to six times as great as previously recognized.
New peer-reviewed research by scientists at the Environmental Defense Fund shows that the climate impact even of ostensibly clean hydrogen rests on how much escapes into the atmosphere. At a low leak rate, the EDF estimates, both "green" hydrogen made using zero-emission electricity and water, and to a lesser extent, "blue" hydrogen made from natural gas (with residual carbon dioxide captured and minimal upstream methane emissions), would dramatically reduce warming impact compared with fossil fuels.
But if leakage of both hydrogen and methane is high, then hydrogen from natural gas could actually increase the 20-year warming impact. Green hydrogen would still be better for the climate over 20 years than the fossil equivalent, but far less so than the climate-neutral promise boosters claim.
Unfortunately, there are currently no data to suggest how much hydrogen might leak in the real world. Existing monitors detect only concentrations high enough to risk explosion (a new generation of devices that can do the job is on the horizon). We do know that leakage will depend on how hydrogen is produced, transported and used.
Hydrogen is most appropriate in activities such as steel and cement production, for which there are no better alternatives, or as feedstock for advanced low-carbon fuels for ships and planes. But it makes no sense to divert renewable energy to make hydrogen for use in cars or homes, where electricity can be used directly instead. And since transporting hydrogen likely increases leakage risk, it's better to produce it close to where it's used.
Equally important, hydrogen is no solution at all if it harms local communities. Water consumption and air pollution from production and use of hydrogen must factor into deployment decisions; people living nearby must be engaged from the start.
For "clean" hydrogen to deliver on its promise, these challenges must be addressed now. It's cheaper and easier to build it right the first time than to fix it later.

Full text: LONDON -- The U.K. recorded its highest-ever temperatures Tuesday with readings of over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, as a heat wave scorched the nation and sparked fires around the capital.
A provisional reading of 40.3 degrees Celsius was recorded in the village of Coningsby in eastern England, according to the national meteorological service, surpassing the previous record of 38.7 degrees set in July 2019.
During the day, at least 34 places across the country broke the previous record, the service said.
Several blazes broke out across London -- including a large fire in a residential area -- that authorities said were caused in part by the record-breaking temperatures.
"The recent hot, dry weather has made the ground extremely dry, which unfortunately means grassland and parks will burn quickly when exposed to even the smallest of sparks," said a London Fire Brigade spokesperson.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Twitter that the brigade was under "immense pressure," and warned citizens to stay safe.
Tuesday has been the second successive day of scorching weather in the nation. The U.K. government has declared a national emergency, while the national meteorological service, the Met Office, triggered its first-ever "red extreme heat warning" across England.
Nationwide, schools and summer camps have closed, hospitals have canceled routine visits and transport has been disrupted, with many railways and the London subway system urging customers to stay at home.
The heat warped runways at U.K. airports on Monday, forcing Luton Airport to suspend all flights until early evening. The Met Office has warned against melting asphalt on roads and has advised citizens not to travel.
"In this country we're used to treating a hot spell as a chance to go and play in the sun," said Penny Endersby, chief executive at the Met Office, in a press release. "This is not that sort of weather."
The searing heat has descended on the U.K. against a backdrop of extreme weather across Europe. Temperatures in parts of Spain and France have climbed to their highest in history. Hundreds of people have died and thousands have been evacuated, with 659 dead in Portugal alone.
In southwestern France, firefighters were struggling on Tuesday to contain wildfires that were raging out of control. Two fires have destroyed more than 47,691 acres of pine forests over the past week in the Gironde region, forcing the evacuation of more than 34,000 people, local authorities said. Thick smoke filled the air in the city of Bordeaux, where health authorities advised people to stay indoors.
The fire destroyed five campsites near the Dune of Pilat, the tallest sand dune in Europe and a popular tourist destination. About 2,000 firefighters and 10 water-bomber planes were deployed across the area, local authorities said Tuesday.
Scientists have warned that climate change is likely to make weather of this severity more common. Dr. Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London, said, "Climate change is an absolute game-changer for heat waves."
"It would have been almost impossible to see temperatures of 40 degrees in London without climate change," he said.

U.S. News: Chips Bill Seeks to Limit Benefits Outside the U.S. --- Draft measure would bar firms from using subsidies if they are building plants in China

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A bill providing roughly $52 billion to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing would impose guardrails aimed at ensuring adversarial countries such as China don't benefit too, according to the draft legislation.
The chip legislation has been narrowed from a broader bill to help the U.S. better compete in advanced technology, and details are still being hashed out ahead of expected procedural votes in the Senate as soon as Tuesday.
As drafted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and other lawmakers, the bill would provide around $52 billion in subsidies for attracting advanced semiconductor manufacturing to the U.S.
It would seek to prevent companies from using the subsidies if they also were building or expanding advanced semiconductor manufacturing plants in China or other potentially unfriendly countries, according to a draft reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Some companies including Intel Corp. have been encouraging lawmakers to ease standards for qualifying for the subsidies for companies doing business with China, according to people familiar with the matter.
Asked if it was encouraging a more flexible standard, Intel said in a statement that it along with others has been providing input "to ensure that we have the best legislation possible and don't inadvertently undermine the global competitiveness of companies that receive CHIPS funds."
The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, didn't respond to a question on whether it supports the guardrail provision.
In a statement, SIA President and CEO John Neuffer said the group is "encouraged the legislation is progressing and look forward to swift enactment of investments that strengthen domestic chip manufacturing, design and research."
The Senate could take a procedural vote on the bill as early as Tuesday, an aide said, which will indicate how much Republican support the legislation has. An early bipartisan vote almost certainly paves the way for clearing hurdles to final passage.
The two parties were divided over the legislation for months, with Republicans saying a House version of the bill had elements related to jobs and climate change that strayed from the original intent of competing with China.
A further hurdle arose when Senate Democrats sought to revive a separate effort to pass a climate and prescription-drug bill along party lines.
That led Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to threaten to block the broader competitiveness bill. It has since been narrowed to focus on subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing.
A spokesman for Mr. McConnell declined to comment on whether the Kentucky Republican has officially changed his position. But the climate and prescription-drug bill also has run into problems, easing GOP concerns.
On Sunday Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) tweeted: "This will green light proceeding this week to shore up the dangerous vulnerability of US supply chain for advanced semiconductors."
But there's no guarantee that even the sharply narrowed version can pass and become law, as lawmakers push to get it done ahead of the August congressional recess.
The bill would jettison virtually everything else from the far-reaching competitiveness packages approved by the Senate and House over the past year or so, in hopes of ending a long congressional standoff.
Among the high-profile provisions that appeared likely to be cut -- for now -- were additional federal funding for cutting-edge technology research; proposed national-security reviews of some outbound U.S. foreign investments; waivers of tariffs on Chinese imports; and curbs on the sale of counterfeit goods online, among other provisions.
The new narrow version is expected to clear initial procedural votes in the Senate, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Another question is whether the House can muster the votes to pass the legislation. Although the effort has support from Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D,. Calif.) and other leaders, some House Democrats are expected to oppose the subsidies to the prosperous semiconductor industry. That means the bill might need support from some Republicans to pass in the often-partisan House.
Numerous companies are waiting for Congress to pass the $52 billion incentive package for chip production and research before committing to significant expansion efforts, according to company executives and funding proposal documents.
The expansion plans anticipated getting part of their funding from the subsidy package, which early on had bipartisan support in Congress and has been backed by the Biden administration.
Those planned facilities would come on top of around $50 billion of plant investments already announced over the past two years.
Critics of government funding for the semiconductor makers say the industry is taking advantage of the chip shortage and that companies would have moved ahead with U.S. projects without subsidies.
The government money is aimed at revitalizing U.S. chip production after manufacturing in recent decades shifted to Asia, where financial inducements have been plentiful and costs lower.

Full text: Former WeWork Chief Executive Adam Neumann resurfaced with a new company earlier this year, in a buzzy, young industry that aims to use cryptocurrencies to fight climate change.
Months later, that company, Flowcarbon, and a host of similar startups have either slowed operations or delayed product rollouts -- the latest fallout of tanking markets.
Flowcarbon, one of a group of companies that are issuing cryptocurrencies backed by carbon credits, has decided to "wait for markets to stabilize" before launching its products, said Chief Executive and co-founder Dana Gibber. Other outfits such as Toucan Protocol Association and KlimaDAO have effectively frozen new business as a plunge in crypto coincided with a crackdown on issuance of new cryptocurrency tokens by a big carbon-market registry.
Flowcarbon and its peers are combining cryptocurrency, a type of digital asset that trades on decentralized computer networks, with another largely unregulated and volatile financial instrument: carbon credits.
Such credits are issued by projects that aim to remove carbon-dioxide from the atmosphere or prevent emissions from being produced, through forest planting or conservation, for instance. Each credit represents one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed or avoided. Corporations or individuals buy the credits and retire them to offset their greenhouse-gas emissions, as investors and others demand action to combat climate change.
Most carbon credits are sold through brokers or directly by project developers, a process critics say is clunky, opaque and time-consuming. Flowcarbon and its peers say they can change that by bringing credits onto their networks as crypto tokens -- Flowcarbon's is called the Goddess Nature Token -- where they can be traded in large volumes like digital money and destroyed, or "burned," when the owner wants to offset emissions.
"As someone who bought credits from brokers in the past, buying and burning tokens is far, far easier," Mark Cuban, a tech billionaire and crypto investor, said in a written response to questions. Mr. Cuban has used Klima tokens to offset 1,100 metric tons of personal and business carbon emissions, according to KlimaDAO data.
Venture capitalists invested around $267 million into climate or carbon-related crypto deals in 2021 and another $156 million this year through early July -- a surge in investment from previous years although a fraction of the billions invested in cryptocurrency deals overall, according to research firm PitchBook Data Inc.
A good chunk of that funding has gone to Flowcarbon, which was co-founded by Mr. Neumann -- best known as the ousted head of office-rental firm WeWork. WeWork's spectacular crash, shelved public offering and bailout in 2019 became the subject of an Apple TV+ drama starring Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway. Flowcarbon says Mr. Neumann isn't involved in the daily operations of the company.
Mr. Neumann has invested in a number of startups as well as real estate, the Journal has reported. He didn't respond to a request for comment.
The fledgling industry took off after Toucan and KlimaDAO started selling their tokens in October, driving an influx of money to the carbon markets. At its peak in late October, the value of all Klima tokens in circulation topped $1 billion.
For the six months through March, more than 23 million carbon credits were moved onto crypto networks. That accounted for about 28% of credits removed from the registries where they were listed during that period, according to an analysis by data provider Trove Research Ltd. So far, less than 2% of those credits have been used to offset carbon emissions and the bulk have been traded, according to KlimaDAO data.
During the last three months of 2021, hundreds of millions of metric tons of carbon have been traded through crypto tokens, with a value topping $3 billion, according to KlimaDAO data. That is a similar volume to the carbon-trading activity for all of last year outside of the crypto markets, according to carbon-markets data tracker Ecosystem Marketplace.
Many carbon-market watchers still aren't sure how helpful carbon-backed tokens will be, or whether they are good for the overall carbon-offset market, given the speculation that has often accompanied cryptocurrencies.
The purpose of carbon credits is offsetting emissions, said Guy Turner, Trove Research's CEO. "If people are now buying those tokens because they see it's a moneymaking machine. . .I think that's potentially unhealthy," he said.
Some see snapping up the credits for investment as healthy."In order for carbon credits to have a significant impact on the climate crisis, the market for them must scale up by orders of magnitude," said a group that says it represents KlimaDAO's core project team and that maintains anonymity of its members. "Speculation plays a critical role in scaling any market" by bringing in enough money to promote easy, liquid trading and accurate prices, they said.
"We think it is OK if people can make money either as an investment or a hedge against higher carbon costs," Toucan Chairman Julian Sommer said. "But it should not be the only use case."
In May, Flowcarbon announced it had raised $70 million from presales of its token, as well as money from funds run by big-name venture investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst, among others.
By that time, however, cryptocurrencies were in free fall, having lost $1 trillion in value since November.
Meanwhile, also in May, the biggest carbon-offset registry halted the use of its credits to back new cryptocurrency tokens, saying it was concerned that the current method of creating those tokens was causing confusion in the carbon markets. The registry, Verra, said it is studying new methods of creating the tokens.
Flowcarbon had expected to launch its token by the end of June, but put that plan on hold indefinitely, said Ms. Gibber. In recent weeks, the company has been announcing partnerships to help it offer services like calculation of carbon footprints for credit buyers and loans for credit-issuing projects.
"We invest with a long-term view and remain very confident about the market," said Arianna Simpson, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz handling the Flowcarbon investment. General Catalyst declined to comment.
Toucan, Klima and other crypto-carbon startups say they are waiting for Verra to propose a new method of bringing credits onto cryptocurrency networks and hunkering down until the crash in crypto markets eases.
"When everything is up and everyone is having a party, everyone says, 'Oh, of course we're going to put money behind carbon,'" said Toucan's Mr. Sommer. "Now everyone needs to survive."

Environmental groups and progressives in Congress are pressing the Biden administration to toughen regulations on power utilities, block new oil and gas drilling on federal land and raise auto fuel efficiency standards, among other things.
Some environmental advocates, including the Sunrise Movement and Evergreen Action, have proposed more extreme actions -- such as a halt to offshore oil production or banning U.S. crude oil exports -- and say Mr. Biden could do so by declaring a national climate emergency under federal laws that give presidents expanded powers in times of crisis.
Some of those measures could raise gasoline prices and other energy costs for consumers, something Mr. Biden wants to avoid as his Democratic Party faces crucial midterm elections.
Republicans in Congress and energy companies could also be expected to challenge any effort that could limit production. The American Petroleum Institute, in a statement Friday, said that it is working to drive down emissions while backing "smart policies that promote U.S. energy leadership and provide affordable energy."
Other options could help consumers but lead to painful consequences elsewhere.
An oil-export ban could reduce America's prices, but it would be a gut punch to allies around the world reliant on U.S. supply as they try to wean themselves off Russian oil and gas, said Bob McNally, who served as an energy adviser to former President George W. Bush and is now an analyst at Rapidan Energy Group. "For the world, it would be a heart attack," he added. "Whatever he does would lead to a collapse in investment in U.S. oil and gas," Mr. McNally said.
Mr. Biden, who was in Saudi Arabia on Friday on a mission aimed in part at improving relations with the world's largest crude exporter, issued a statement saying he would take "strong executive action to meet this moment." Mr. Biden didn't give specifics.
Mr. Biden's latest dilemma was triggered Thursday, when Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) said he couldn't support a plan to fund climate measures with tax increases, citing the risk of setting off more inflation. Mr. Manchin said in a radio interview Friday that he wanted to see evidence inflation was receding before committing to climate and tax provisions.
Mr. Biden's ability to act has also been clouded by a recent Supreme Court decision that said the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority in seeking to limit emissions from power plants.
The court said that when federal agencies issue regulations with sweeping economic and political consequences -- in the case it was considering, rules aimed at phasing out coal consumption to address climate change -- the regulations are presumptively invalid unless Congress has specifically authorized the action.
That ruling might empower more challenges to executive orders that could delay implementation for years.
Environmentalists including the Center for Biological Diversity say Mr. Biden could overcome those limitations through several levers under his emergency-power authority.
The conservative Supreme Court majority gave approval to broad use of executive emergency powers in 2020, allowing then-President Donald Trump to keep building a security wall with $2.5 billion reallocated under powers related to the declaration of a national emergency on the southern border.
Rising seas, melting ice caps and other effects are unequivocally driven by greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity, according to scientists convened by the United Nations. They have said that emissions must be halved by 2030 from 2010 levels to help avoid more-catastrophic changes in weather and the environment.
In a report earlier this year, the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit environmental group, said the president could respond by invoking emergency-authority powers that draw from the National Emergencies Act and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.
"The fact that we have more extreme heat waves and more extreme hurricanes, it is very palpable for people that we are in a national climate emergency situation," said Jean Su, who leads the energy-justice program at the Center for Biological Diversity.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden signaled he was prepared to support a narrow bill that lowered prescription drug costs and extended Affordable Care Act subsidies but left out climate provisions, as Senate Democrats grappled with whether to abandon their broader economic agenda after intraparty talks hit an impasse.
Mr. Biden said that if the Senate didn't move forward with climate legislation, he would turn to executive action, calling clean energy and combating climate change urgent matters. On the prescription-drug portion of the agenda, he said the Senate "should move forward, pass it before the August recess, and get it to my desk so I can sign it," characterizing it as a major victory for American households.
The statement came a day after talks between Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) broke down. Mr. Manchin told Mr. Schumer that he would back a prescription-drug proposal but couldn't commit to backing tax increases or climate provisions, citing inflation worries.
Such a stance effectively blocked Democrats from moving forward quickly with their package -- Mr. Manchin is a critical vote -- and left them scrambling on how to advance climate policy, a priority for many members of the party and progressive activists.
Responding to questions at a press conference in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Mr. Biden said he would use "every power I have as president to continue to fulfill my pledge to move toward dealing with global warming," but he declined to offer details. Asked if Mr. Manchin was negotiating in good faith, he said: "I didn't negotiate with Joe Manchin. I have no idea."
Mr. Schumer now has to decide whether to hold out hope for a broader bill or proceed with a narrower measure, and his office had no immediate comment on what sort of bill he would put on the Senate floor or when.
Democrats had been hoping to complete a deal before the coming August break, when lawmakers in both parties will begin to focus on their re-election races.
In elections this fall, Democrats are at serious risk of losing control of the House, potentially making the coming weeks their last shot at passing an economic plan.
They are aiming to use a special process called reconciliation, which allows budget-related legislation to advance with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes typically required in the Senate.
Republicans had criticized Democrats' planned tax increases, saying they would batter small businesses already hit by rising inflation, and said that the focus on renewable energy would drive up costs in a country still dependent on fossil fuels and now grappling with high gasoline prices. Some Democrats had also expressed concerns about increasing taxes before the election.
Many Democratic lawmakers and climate advocates now see their best hope in action from state governments or Mr. Biden, including expanded mandates for clean power, rules for reducing consumption or bans on oil and gas drilling. Some want Mr. Biden to declare a climate emergency, which could halt U.S. energy exports, block fossil-fuel shipments, or shift federal funding into wind, solar and battery manufacturing. Any such moves would face political constraints.
In a radio interview Friday, Mr. Manchin said he wanted to see evidence inflation was receding before committing to climate and tax provisions.
"Let's wait until that comes out," Mr. Manchin said he told Mr. Schumer about inflation readings and Federal Reserve rate moves. "Can't we wait to make sure that we do nothing to add to that?" he said he told him, in an interview with the Hoppy Kercheval radio program in West Virginia.
Many Democrats aired frustration with Mr. Manchin's stance, saying they had believed talks were on track for a climate deal.
"To have him slam the door on that is terrible," said Sen. Tina Smith (D., Minn.). Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.), who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of Mr. Manchin: "Every time, what he makes clear over and over again, is that he can't close a deal, and that you can't trust what he says."
In recent weeks, some Democrats had thought the party could pass a bill that would raise roughly $1 trillion in revenue and spend about $500 billion, largely on tax incentives for reducing carbon emissions. Senate Democrats had previously said they had agreed to broaden existing 3.8% taxes on high-income households to cover active business income, dedicating the money to extend the life of Medicare, a priority for Mr. Manchin.
Some Democrats said Friday the party should move forward with the healthcare provisions and give up for now on enacting climate laws. A package focused on drug prices and health-insurance subsidies would need to win a favorable opinion from the Senate's parliamentarian to qualify for reconciliation.
"We can't keep spinning in circles," said Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.), who had previously led the House's effort in 2010 to cap greenhouse-gas emissions. "We need to get done what we can, and I will push the administration to take aggressive action in the face of sad, frustrating congressional inaction."
Democrats have previously backed a measure that would empower Medicare to negotiate for the price of certain high-cost drugs, limit beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs to $2,000 a year and extend premium and copayment assistance to some lower-income seniors. The lower drug costs would save the government money, potentially funding the health-insurance subsidies.

Full text: Sen. Joe Manchin, the pivotal vote in Democrats' efforts to pass a bill aimed at fighting climate change, told Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that he wouldn't support an economic package in the coming weeks that raises taxes or includes climate provisions, according to people familiar with the matter.
Instead, Mr. Manchin (D., W.Va.) told Mr. Schumer (D., N.Y.) that he would only support a bill in August that includes provisions aimed at lowering the price of prescription drugs and a two-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to one of the people.
"Senator Manchin believes it's time for leaders to put political agendas aside, re-evaluate and adjust to the economic realities the country faces to avoid taking steps that add fuel to the inflation fire," a spokeswoman said.
The Washington Post earlier reported Mr. Manchin's position. White House spokesman Andrew Bates declined to comment.
Democrats have been racing to complete a deal before a coming August break, when lawmakers in both parties will begin to focus solely on their re-election races and passing legislation becomes even more difficult on Capitol Hill. Mr. Manchin told Mr. Schumer that he could only support a bill in the coming weeks that includes the drug and healthcare measures.
Mr. Manchin's new position in the negotiations represents a shift from a view he has held for much of the year. For months, he repeated that he would support a bill that raised taxes, reduced drug costs, provided support for energy production and narrowed the deficit. He also said he would support boosting taxes to reduce the federal budget deficit, a move that he said would ease inflation.
Democrats -- who have already jettisoned an expanded child tax credit and child-care subsidies -- have viewed climate measures in particular as a necessary policy step to avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change. Now they may face the difficult choice of whether to forgo climate measures and instead accept an agreement that can win unanimous support in the Democratic caucus and become law while they are assured control of Congress.
Democrats are aiming to use a special process called reconciliation, which allows legislation to advance with just a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes typically required in the Senate. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats need Mr. Manchin's vote to advance any party-line package past united Republican opposition.
In recent weeks, some Democrats had believed the party could pass a bill that raised roughly $1 trillion in revenue and spent roughly $500 billion largely on tax incentives for reducing carbon emissions. Democrats in the House last year passed a bill that raised roughly $2 trillion in taxes, while spending money on an expanded child tax credit, universal prekindergarten and climate change measures, among other programs. Mr. Manchin rejected that proposal in December, in part citing inflation concerns.
In the midterm elections this fall, Democrats are at risk of losing control of the House, which would make the coming weeks likely their last shot at passing a sweeping economic plan for at least two years.
Mr. Schumer and Mr. Manchin have been meeting for weeks in an effort to cobble together an agreement. In addition to political deadlines, they will also soon face procedural constraints: The window to use the reconciliation process closes on Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.
On the price of prescription drugs, an issue both parties have long tried to address, Democrats have previously prepared a measure that would empower Medicare to negotiate for the price of certain high-cost drugs, cap beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs to $2,000 a year, and extend premium and copayment assistance to some lower-income seniors. The lower drug costs would save the government money, potentially funding the ACA health-insurance subsidies.
Extending subsidies for purchasing insurance under the ACA would help millions of Americans avoid premium increases next year, though Congress would again have to extend them if Democrats only enact a two-year extension.
This week, Mr. Manchin had said: "We know what we can pass is basically the drug pricing on Medicare. We know that one. Is there any more we can do? I don't know. I am very very cautious."
An agreement that only includes measures on drug pricing and a temporary extension of healthcare subsidies would represent a major defeat for Democrats, who envisioned enacting an array of new policies during their time controlling Washington.

Full text: For centuries, bond investing has boiled down to forecasting two things: which way interest rates are going to move and how likely a borrower is to repay its debts. A handful of startups are betting that to predict repayments in the future, bond analysts will need better data on something they've long overlooked -- climate risk.
The new firms are competing to design algorithms that can predict the likelihood of natural disasters hitting specific towns, industrial parks, even individual buildings, and how much damage they could do. That could become more relevant if wildfires, floods, storms and drought strike more frequently and with greater severity, creating potential new losses for holders of municipal, corporate and mortgage-backed debt.
One company marketing such geospatial data to Wall Street is risQ, a Boston-based firm launched in 2016 by a handful of academics. The firm created a digital grid that divides the U.S. into 100-meter by 100-meter patches of dirt, forecasts the likelihood of climate events in each square and assigns associated risk scores to the bonds that would be affected.
"Eventually this chicken is going to come home to roost," says the firm's 34-year-old Chief Executive Evan Kodra, who says he fell into academia after trying to make it as a hip-hop producer in his teens. "It has morphed into a systemic risk that no one person has to worry about when it will hit until it does."
Climate-risk cartographers are attracting money. Financial-services giant Intercontinental Exchange Inc. bought risQ in December for an undisclosed sum and renamed it ICE Data and Innovation Impact Group, though it's still more widely known by its original name. Credit ratings firm Moody's Corp. has purchased a majority stake in a similar company called Four Twenty Seven Inc., and Sustainalytics, a unit of Morningstar Inc., has started a partnership to assess climate risk in corporate bond markets with a competing firm called XDI.
Geospatial analysis could also help bond buyers better evaluate the credentials of the environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investment products money managers offer them. Greenwashing -- or making misleading claims about ESG offerings -- by asset managers has become a hot-button issue, and the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new rules in May governing funds marketed with ESG labels.
"Satellite data can provide additional insights to identify property and location intelligence, validate claims and measure impact," says Andrea Blackman, head of Moody's ESG Solutions.
Sales have grown slowly for risQ, which the company says is largely because there hasn't been a big enough climate event -- or chain of events -- to trigger many bond defaults. Most bond issuers benefit from private insurance and federal and state backstops that help them stay afloat after disasters and many investors don't see the need to subscribe. Electric utility PG&E Corp. sought bankruptcy protection in 2019, in part over fallout over the role its electrical equipment played in sparking California wildfires. But wildfires have yet to force a municipality to default.
That could be about to change. Paradise, Calif., which was ravaged by the 2018 Camp Fire, disclosed in a March regulatory filing that one of its agencies may default on a $4.8 million bond next year. The town received $219 million from a settlement in 2020 but said it plans to use those funds to rebuild infrastructure instead.
Even if only a small fraction of bonds suffer from such an event, collateral damage could be significant. About $4 trillion of municipal bonds are outstanding in the U.S., according to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, as well as $10 trillion of corporate bonds and $12 trillion of mortgage-backed bonds, according to SIFMA.
Mr. Kodra began studying statistics as an undergraduate at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville after his hip-hop dreams fell through. "I found a list of the median salaries for majors in the business program, and in mercenary fashion, I picked the highest-paying one," says Mr. Kodra, who is 6'4" and plays competitive basketball four days a week.
A course in business ethics kindled an interest in climate change that led him to complete a doctorate in interdisciplinary engineering at Northeastern University, where he began researching the increased probability of catastrophic weather events.
Mr. Kodra created risQ with money from National Science Foundation grants and freelance work in Boston's startup scene. There he met John Sheffield, a more buttoned-down Harvard University graduate immersed in mapping out vast information troves available in public databases.
Mr. Sheffield joined risQ in 2017 and initially they built a geospatial database for municipal borrowers, ranging from cities and towns to school districts and sewer authorities. The company layered climate data over information like tax revenues, property values, average education, health and income levels.
Over and over, risQ's model showed that bond markets weren't discriminating between municipalities with very different climate risk. A school district near California's wine country has five times the wildfire property-damage risk of a school district a few hours north of Sacramento, for example, but their bonds trade at identical yields, according to risQ research.
Some fund managers subscribed to the product to avoid such pitfalls but many see it as an unnecessary expense. Investors typically rely on their own analysts and outside advice from credit ratings firms like Moody's and S&P Global Ratings when lending out money in bond markets. Annual subscriptions at risQ cost in the six figures, according to a person familiar with the matter.
"We've seen natural disasters shut down local economies . . . and we've never seen a default," says Robert Amodeo, head of municipals at Western Asset Management. Private insurers and payments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state funds have kept municipal-bond investors insulated from losses, Mr. Amodeo says.
Sales picked up for risQ last year when the company expanded coverage to include mortgage-backed bonds, using 1.2 billion records culled from various databases, Mr. Sheffield says.
Clients want to know the likelihood of weather destroying the properties linked to bonds they own, which could prompt homeowners to walk away from their loans, he says. They are also worried that creeping climate change will sink home prices as sea levels rise in some places and wildfire seasons expand in others.
The firm, which now has about 30 clients, has also gotten an unexpected boost from fund managers whose clients are demanding proof of ESG impact from their investments. Individuals and institutions increasingly want their investment dollars to drive changes like reduced carbon emissions, lower wealth disparities and improved access to healthcare and education.
"ESG reporting can be challenging, but in risQ's case it's a rules-driven approach that is fact-based and analytical," says Marty Mannion, co-head of automated trading at TD Securities Inc.
After George Floyd's murder in 2020, money managers began using risQ's data to identify municipal bonds for them to purchase to promote racial equity, Mr. Kodra says. More recently, some have asked the firm to identify mortgage bonds with higher quotients of homes in low-income areas. Such purchases should drive bond prices up, and yields down, lowering borrowing costs for underbanked communities, Mr. Sheffield says.
Next, risQ is working on a geospatial database of Europe and an eventual expansion to national government-bond markets around the world.
"In the long run we want to give every investor a unified ESG picture of all their assets, regardless of the asset class," Mr. Sheffield says.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Congress returns Monday with Democrats aiming to revive central pieces of President Biden's stalled economic agenda while trying to keep on track a separate, bipartisan bill targeted at boosting competitiveness with China that top Republicans are threatening to block.
House Democrats also are set to roll out legislation responding to the Supreme Court ruling ending federal abortion protections. The push could include legislation to write into law the right to an abortion before fetal viability, as well as a bill intended to block any state attempts to criminalize travel for the purpose of getting an abortion. The bills wouldn't have enough support to pass the Senate.
The three-week work period may be the last chance lawmakers have for a legislative victory before campaigning begins in earnest for midterm election races across the country. Republicans are heavily favored to win back control of the House this fall, while the Senate is seen as a tossup.
Lawmakers have been working since last year to negotiate the China bill, which aims to bring semiconductor manufacturers to the U.S., by reconciling differing versions passed by the House and Senate. The bill, called USICA in the Senate, was inching toward the finish line when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) last month said he wouldn't move forward unless Democrats dropped their efforts to revive economic proposals that Republicans oppose.
The purpose of the Democratic economic package is to lower prescription-drug prices, provide incentives for reducing carbon emissions and raise taxes on companies and high-income households.
Negotiations on the China bill have since come to a standstill, a GOP aide said.
In recent weeks, several chip manufacturers have announced they would reconsider plans to build in the U.S. if Congress didn't act soon. An all-senators classified briefing by Biden administration officials is planned for Wednesday to emphasize the national security implications, said several aides. Efforts are under way to put together a similar briefing for the House, said a person familiar with the matter.
"Fundamentally we will not have the ability to protect ourselves as a nation if this bill is not passed," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview, pointing to the U.S. dependency on Taiwan for semiconductors and overall supply-chain disruptions. Ms. Raimondo acknowledged Mr. McConnell has slowed down the process.
Some Democrats are pushing for House leadership to simply take the bill the Senate passed last year and put it up for a vote, a Democratic lawmaker said, worried that future delays would prevent the bill from passing at all. The Senate version is narrower than the House version, which included some provisions to address climate change.
"Mitch isn't saying anything new," said Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.). "We should be doing a China bill that accelerates domestic chip development and increases certain categories of technological research funding."
Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.) said that "frankly we could have done it a year ago, but at this point it needs to get done in the next three weeks."
At the same time, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) is working to revive talks with Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) on the Democrats' climate, prescription-drug pricing and tax bill, which Democrats could pass without any Republican votes. That bill, a stripped-down version of last year's failed Build Back Better legislation, would use a special process called reconciliation that allows it to advance with just a simple majority in the 50-50 Senate, rather than the 60 typically required.
Mr. Manchin blocked a roughly $2 trillion version of the bill last year and pressed for a smaller plan with fewer short-term programs and more emphasis on reducing budget deficits. But it has taken months for any plan to come together, and Democrats are running out of time with elections approaching that could end their slim majorities.
But there is no full bill, and it would still need support from Mr. Manchin, the rest of the Senate Democrats and nearly all House Democrats. A spokeswoman for Mr. Manchin said the senator "continues to work in good faith to see if there is a pathway forward."
Some of the tax changes, including the fate of the U.S. piece of the global corporate minimum tax agreement and the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, remain in flux. A proposed surtax on people with incomes above $10 million seems less likely to be included. Other ideas, such as about $80 billion of spending on beefed-up tax enforcement, seem more likely to advance.
Democrats have settled on at least one tax increase, aides said. They are planning a change that would raise taxes on many business owners with incomes of at least $400,000 for individuals and $500,000 for married couples. The emerging plan would devote the money to extending the life of the Medicare trust fund.
Under current law, high-income investors, wage earners and self-employed people pay 3.8% in taxes atop their regular income-tax rates. But active business income doesn't face that same additional tax.
In some instances, including Mr. Biden's own book-writing business, taxpayers attempt to reclassify earnings that could be considered self-employment income or wages as lower-taxed business profits. The Democrats' plan would hit that group with a 3.8% tax but it would also affect a much broader set of owners of closely held businesses.
Reports of Democrats making detailed choices to pare back their tax increases and spending agenda are an indication that they are making progress toward something that can fit within Mr. Manchin's parameters, said Donald Schneider, deputy head of U.S. policy at Piper Sandler. But he said that some of the most crucial issues remain unresolved, including Mr. Manchin's insistence on an all-of-the-above energy strategy that would conflict with progressives' preference for focusing on climate change.

Full text: HSBC Holdings PLC executive Stuart Kirk said he resigned, seven weeks after being suspended from his job for saying climate change need not be a worry for investors.
Mr. Kirk, who was head of responsible investment and research at HSBC Asset Management, caused a firestorm with a conference presentation in May. He argued humans could adapt to climate emergencies and that policy makers were exaggerating the risks. It was taken as a broadside against the trillions of dollars flowing from investors into environmental, social and governance, or ESG, products and funds.
Mr. Kirk's critics in the aftermath included HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn, who said the comments were inconsistent with the bank's aim to help the world cut carbon emissions to zero.
In a post on LinkedIn Thursday, Mr. Kirk said he quit after concluding the bank's behavior toward him was unsustainable.
"Investing is hard. So is saving our planet. Opinions on both differ. But humanity's best chance of success is open and honest debate. If companies believe in diversity and speaking up, they need to walk the talk."
He said he is starting a new project for investments based around overcoming challenges with human ingenuity.
"I will continue to prod with a sharp stick the nonsense, hypocrisy, sloppy logic and group-think inside the mainstream bubble of sustainable finance," Mr. Kirk wrote.
An HSBC spokeswoman declined to comment.
Mr. Kirk's May comments set off a debate across the finance industry. Banks, asset managers and other financial companies increasingly have touted their ESG credentials and made them a central plank in their own governance and strategies. For example, some of Mr. Quinn's pay awards are tied to ESG measures.
Assets in funds focused on ESG principles hit $2.74 trillion last year, according to Morningstar. Pension funds and individual investors alike have said they want to back projects that curb environmental damage or social ills. Activist investors have pushed companies including Exxon Mobil to move faster to cut their climate risks.
But critics say it is far from clear what difference the money has made in tackling the problems, and that many green investments would have happened anyway.

Full text: As more companies pledge to neutralize their carbon emissions in response to climate change, securing green power in the U.S. is getting much more expensive.
Surging demand has pushed up the U.S. price of renewable energy certificates, a financial instrument that lets companies say they bought clean electricity from the grid. The price of RECs more than quadrupled at one point last year and is still around triple its level for most of the past decade, data trackers say.
Meanwhile, inflation and supply-chain bottlenecks are driving up costs for another way U.S. companies get their green electricity: by funding solar or wind projects directly in return for their power. Those costs have seen double- or even triple-digit percentage increases, green-energy experts say.
"The market now is tough," said Misti Groves, vice president of market and policy innovation at the Clean Energy Buyers Association, a Washington, D.C., group for green-power buyers.
Companies and governments the world over are increasingly focused on shifting to renewable energy as a way of reducing carbon emissions to help curb global warming. More than 5,000 companies have signed up with the United Nations' Race to Zero campaign, pledging to purchase clean energy and take other measures to help eliminate or offset the greenhouse gases they generate. Some 370 companies including General Motors Co. and Airbnb Inc. have joined a group, RE100, whose members pledge to be 100% powered by renewable energy by midcentury.
In the U.S., renewable energy certificates have long been the cheapest and most common way of procuring green power. The certificates represent the "greenness" of each unit of electricity generated by sources such as solar or wind, and can be bought separately from the power itself. Under current carbon-accounting rules, RECs let companies say they are buying clean energy -- and thus have zero emissions -- even though technically they are using electricity from a grid that can contain green as well as carbon-emitting sources of power.
For most of the past decade, the price for stand-alone RECs was less than $1 per megawatt hour, data trackers say. But last year, as more companies sought RECs to satisfy renewable energy targets, the benchmark price rose from around $1.60 per megawatt hour to more than $7 in August, before falling to around $3 recently, according to data from Karbone Inc., a financial services firm that specializes in renewable energy.
Some companies are fleeing stand-alone RECs in favor of buying clean electricity through long-term contracts with wind or solar developers, in hopes of getting lower, more stable prices.
But the cost of such power-purchase agreements has been soaring, too, pushed by increasing demand as well as supply chain issues, inflation and long wait times to receive necessary approvals to connect new projects to the electric grid.
A report by LevelTen Energy, a renewable-energy marketplace, found that in competitive power markets, prices for long-term contracts for wind and solar-power purchases, which are used to finance new projects, jumped by 15.8% for solar and 41.5% for wind during the first quarter of 2022, compared with the previous year.

Full text: An energy-starved world is turning to coal as natural-gas and oil shortages exacerbated by Russia's war against Ukraine lead countries back to the dirtiest fossil fuel.
From the U.S. to Europe to China, many of the world's largest economies are increasing short-term coal purchases to ensure sufficient supplies of electricity, despite prior pledges by many countries to reduce their coal consumption to combat climate change.
The global competition for coal -- now in short supply after years of declining investment in new mines and resources -- has driven benchmark prices to new records this year. Spot coal prices at Australia's Newcastle port, a key supplier to Asia, topped $400 a ton for the first time last month.
The push is being led by Europe, which is boosting coal purchases to ensure it can keep power flowing to homes and factories after Russia cut gas supplies to the continent. Germany, which has promised to eliminate coal as a power source by 2030, is among the nations now importing more.
"Right now the sentiment is that more coal is better than more Russia," said Alex Msimang, a London partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP specializing in the energy sector.
Parts of the U.S. are boosting use of coal power, as high demand for electricity amid unusually hot temperatures pushes regional power grids to the brink of blackouts this summer.
China, the world's biggest coal consumer, is expanding production of the fuel and its use in power generation, spooked by shortages last year that caused electricity cuts and outages throughout the country, energy experts say.
India is leaning hard on coal as energy demand increases. The nation's coal-power generation hit a record in April, said Rahul Tongia, a senior fellow at New Delhi-based think tank the Centre for Social and Economic Progress.
Domestic coal production in China and India helped drive a 10% increase in global investment in 2021, the International Energy Agency reported last month. The IEA projects another 10% increase this year as China and India try to stave off shortages.
Coal miners such as Anglo-Swiss giant Glencore PLC are cashing in. Glencore, one of the last major miners still big in coal, said last month that it expected $3.2 billion in trading profit in the first half of this year, compared with $3.7 billion for all of 2021. "We expect elevated coal prices to make Glencore one of the leading shareholder-return companies in the market," Deutsche Bank AG analysts wrote.
Coal use fell in many major Western countries over the past decade, displaced by cleaner forms of energy that became more cost-competitive. Natural gas became more plentiful thanks to the U.S. fracking boom and Russian exports to Europe. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power gained market share, buoyed by falling prices and government subsidies and mandates.
Still, global coal demand held strong, fueled by fast-growing energy needs in much of the rest of the world -- and is on track to hit record highs this year, according to IEA forecasts.
The resurgence of coal, which emits around double the carbon dioxide as burning natural gas, further threatens to set back international efforts to keep global temperatures under 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels, and preferably close to 1.5 degrees, by the end of the century.
That is the goal that more than 190 nations agreed to pursue under the 2015 Paris Agreement to avoid the most dangerous potential consequences of global warming. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that emissions, which continue to rise, would need to be drastically reduced by the end of the decade to meet the goal.
Climate activists and forecasters say they are concerned about a rise in coal use, but see it as a short-term phenomenon in the West and are more worried that the Ukraine war and other geopolitical events are spurring natural-gas investments that could operate for decades. "It can be justified but not for long," said Bill Hare, chief executive of the Berlin-based group Climate Analytics, of the coal surge.
While many countries are racing to lock up coal supplies in the short run, they aren't entering into new extended contracts with coal miners, lawyers and industry consultants say. That contrasts with the natural-gas market, where some countries have begun signing long-term deals with shippers in the U.S. and Qatar for liquefied natural gas, or LNG.
Still, efforts to wean Western nations off Russian energy figure to strain global supplies for the foreseeable future. In April, the European Union agreed to ban imports of Russian coal. Before the war, Russia was Europe's largest supplier of the thermal coal used in power generation, and the ban affected around 70% of the supply that European power stations require, according to Rystad Energy.
In addition to Germany, Italy, France, the U.K., the Netherlands and Austria said they are preparing to restart coal-fired power plants, boost their production or keep them running longer than planned. Many countries say they are trying to build up stockpiles of natural gas ahead of winter.
Countries are rejiggering distribution channels to obtain more coal from other big suppliers such as Australia and the U.S., but that takes time and money, said Gerben Hieminga, senior energy-sector economist for Dutch bank ING Groep. "The whole world is doing this," Mr. Hieminga said.
The U.S. can only increase so much without pouring significantly more money into coal production, limiting the duration of the current windfall, said Chris Walker, a 14-year veteran of St. Louis coal miner Peabody Energy Corp. who until last year led its international marketing and trading operation. "They're trying to get more tons out today with no long-term impact on capital," said Mr. Walker, now an industry consultant.
The kind of coal production most easily scaled up is lower-quality coal, generally mined close to the surface, that is less efficient and can satisfy only a fraction of Europe's coal-import needs, said Natalie Biggs, head of thermal-coal market analysis at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. The competition for high-quality coal has so distorted global trade that some Russian coal that normally wouldn't be economical to ship to India through Baltic Sea ports is now making that trip, she said, though that Russian coal is selling at a relative discount.

Full text: Governments grappling with shortages of food and fuel caused by the war in Ukraine are less focused on climate change. Businesses and investors are pushing ahead and taking a bigger role in trying to limit rising temperatures.
Investors were optimistic that last year's global summit in Glasgow, Scotland, would yield progress. But most of the world's biggest emitters have done little to follow through on a deal reached there to accelerate greenhouse-gas cuts. Many countries are restarting coal power plants and relying more on oil and natural gas to make it through this year's energy crisis.
Despite the lack of progress by governments, businesses have continued to invest in green energy, often spurred on by demands from customers. Climate and sustainability startups have raised more than $20 billion in the first half of the year. That puts total fundraising slightly below last year's record pace but well ahead of the pace in 2019 and 2020, according to PitchBook. Sales of green bonds are also up compared with 2019 and 2020 levels, Dealogic data show.
That contrasts with setbacks, including the failure of the Biden administration's climate legislation in Congress. The latest frustration for green power companies was Thursday's U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting the power of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions.
Startup financing is being augmented by spending pledges from established companies such as NextEra Energy Inc., BP PLC and Microsoft Corp. to kick-start new industries such as making hydrogen fuel from renewable electricity and removing carbon directly from the atmosphere.
"Capital markets increasingly don't care that governments are broken," said Sheldon Kimber, CEO of clean-energy developer Intersect Power LLC. Intersect recently raised $750 million from investors including TPG Inc.'s climate fund to build more solar and battery-storage projects and expand into new areas such as green hydrogen.
Demand from businesses and new jobs are driving the energy transition, said Leo Denault, the chief executive of Entergy Corp., a utility that serves the Gulf Coast region, including the area's big fossil-fuel and chemical producers. He said government officials want economic growth and businesses want green energy, so regulators often support the utility's plans to add solar and wind power.
U.S. Steel Corp. recently asked Entergy if it could provide green electricity to serve a new electric arc furnace the steelmaker wanted to build in Arkansas. The company promised to create about 1,000 jobs paying roughly $100,000 a year. That helped Entergy get regulatory approval to add the green power.
Governments are still funding research for new technologies, proposing regulations and making investments in clean power, such as those included in last year's U.S. infrastructure bill. Total public and private global investment in clean energy is expected to rise more than 10% for the second consecutive year to nearly $1.45 trillion this year, according to the International Energy Agency. Such spending remained largely flat from 2017 to 2020.
The recent increase is being somewhat offset by inflation and isn't enough to avoid the worst effects of global warming, the IEA and scientists say. Roughly $2.8 trillion would be required to meet current climate pledges by 2030 and more than $4 trillion will be needed annually to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the IEA says.
The private sector still needs to bolster its spending and avoid greenwashing, or misleading on climate progress, analysts say. Business priorities might not match up with those of policy makers, could leave poorer countries behind and could shift an economic downturn.
Some investors say the war in Ukraine has made building domestic supplies of clean energy a national security issue. Many are still putting money into the sector while maintaining pressure on publicly traded companies to limit emissions. Shareholders have voted on about 275 sustainability-related proposals this year at company annual meetings, a record total that is up more than 40% from last year, according to the nonprofit Sustainable Investments Institute.Investors are pushing companies such as Home Depot Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Jack in the Box Inc. to change, though such proposals don't always get results and many still receive muted support. Companies like Starbucks Corp. are also linking executive compensation or borrowing costs to meeting sustainability targets.
Even though a selloff in shares of many clean-energy companies has slowed new public listings to a trickle, some green startups that previously announced deals to go public by merging with special-purpose acquisition companies -- or SPACs -- are still closing them and raising money.
"The best hope we have to get this right is capital flows," said Stuart Landesberg, CEO of natural-consumer-products seller Grove Collaborative Holdings Inc., which recently raised more than $135 million in a combination with a SPAC backed by British billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Group. Mr. Landesberg said the company is well financed even though shares have fallen about 50% from the SPAC's listing price and many investors pulled their money out of the deal.
Polestar Automotive Holding U.K. PLC recently completed a SPAC merger that generated about $900 million for the Swedish electric-vehicle maker to expand production.
"It's going to be the private sector that's really going to drive this," said Amy Yoder, CEO of clean fertilizer producer Anuvia Plant Nutrients, a Winter Park, Fla., startup that has privately raised about $170 million since early last year.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration plans to block new offshore oil drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, while allowing limited expansion in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's south coast.
The proposal released by the Interior Department on Friday would allow as many as 11 oil lease sales for offshore drilling over the course of five years.
But the plan is still being developed, and gives the administration several options -- including one that would forgo new lease sales entirely, according to the Interior Department. Ultimately, a final decision is months away.
Blasting the plan, environmental groups said they would push for the option with no new leasing. Some voiced concern the administration was backing away from President Biden's pledge as a candidate to block new drilling on federal territory.
"President Biden campaigned on climate leadership, but he seems poised to let us down at the worst possible moment," said Brady Bradshaw, senior oceans campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. "The reckless approval of yet more offshore drilling would mean more oil spills, more dead wildlife and more polluted communities."
A White House spokesman declined to respond directly. Interior Department officials said they didn't have a preferred option, and that the ultimate decision -- following a public comment period -- could be one that called for no new leases.
Some oil advocates, meanwhile, said the plan didn't go far enough to ensure future supplies of domestic oil to counter rising energy prices globally.
"Our allies across the free world are in desperate need of American oil and gas," said Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), a swing vote for Mr. Biden's agenda in the 50-50 Senate. "I am disappointed to see that 'zero' lease sales is even an option on the table."
Industry lobbyists applauded the proposal to expand leasing but noted that many potential roadblocks lie ahead.
"This proposed leasing plan is just one step in the process, and it is imperative that the Administration act swiftly to finalize and implement the program as proposed, without reduced acreage," Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, said in a statement.
Mr. Biden, a Democrat, made a transition away from fossil fuels a priority when he took office, but in recent months rising inflation driven in part by higher fuel costs has led him to recalibrate -- pushing oil companies to produce more and tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserves in a bid to lower prices.
White House officials have wrestled with the plan for weeks without making a decision as environmental groups made it clear they believed Mr. Biden wasn't moving his climate agenda quickly enough.
On Thursday, Mr. Biden's efforts took a fresh blow from a new Supreme Court ruling that restricts what presidents can do through the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory agencies to address climate change and other issues.
The most expansive option in the Interior Department proposal would seek to help the industry by allowing it to grow in parts of the western and central Gulf of Mexico where it already operates.
Congress has set large parts of the eastern Gulf near Florida off limits, and the proposal wouldn't allow any new leases there. It would offer no more than one lease sale in Alaska's Cook Inlet.
"From Day One, President Biden and I have made clear our commitment to transition to a clean energy economy," Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said. "Today, we put forward an opportunity for the American people to consider and provide input on the future of offshore oil and gas leasing."
The proposal released Friday is part of a process to implement a new five-year plan for drilling on the outer continental shelf required under federal law. The proposal comes months behind schedule to meet the legal requirements and faces several more months of reviews before the department can offer new offshore areas for lease.
Under even the quickest scenarios, that might not lead to new oil-and-gas leasing until 2024 or 2025 and new development potentially years after that.
That delay frustrates some in the industry while environmentalists said it also undermines arguments from Mr. Manchin and other industry advocates that the plan is helpful to address rising prices.
The oil industry has said it needs continued leasing to maintain its reserves for future production and to help prevent future price shocks like one that has recently sent energy prices to historic highs. About 15% of U.S. oil production comes from drilling in federal waters.
The industry's largest trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, has called for lifting restrictions on offshore drilling as part of a recent 10-point plan "to restore U.S. energy leadership."
The industry also wants the administration to reinstate plans it canceled this year to auction drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska.

Full text: The Supreme Court's decision to curb the Environmental Protection Agency's powers could provide legal ammunition for challenges to financial regulations envisioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies.
The SEC is regarded by analysts as an obvious target for legal challenges employing the logic in the EPA case. The Wall Street regulator is drafting rules to require public companies to disclose climate risks and greenhouse-gas emissions. The ruling's impact, moreover, could be wider-ranging, touching on initiatives from the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies, legal analysts said.
In Thursday's 6-3 decision, the court said the Obama-era EPA exceeded its authority when it devised the Clean Power Plan, a regulatory approach to reducing carbon pollution from power plants.
Elaborating on earlier decisions, the high court said regulations that have sweeping economic and political impact should be invalidated unless Congress has clearly authorized action by an agency.
The justices laid out factors for lower courts to consider when deciding if a "major question" is implicated by a regulation, and the breadth of the doctrine is likely to be clarified in future Supreme Court cases, attorneys said. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the Obama-era EPA had exercised broad authority given to it by Congress.
"Any administrative agencies that are proposing to reinterpret their statutory authority to do novel things are potentially affected by this," said Jonathan Brightbill, a former Justice Department lawyer now at the firm Winston & Strawn.
By expanding on this major-questions principle, the court created a road map for lower courts to strike down other regulations.
The ruling could also put pressure on lawmakers to lay out policies more specifically and clearly delineate agencies' authority, rather than allowing regulators to interpret legislation and advance policies.
Eugene Scalia, who was labor secretary in the Trump administration, said financial regulators are crafting new rules "custom-built to fail in court" absent major changes.
"The SEC, FTC and other agencies are making novel use of old statutes to make big, sweeping policy changes -- which is exactly what the Supreme Court has said it would review very, very skeptically," said Mr. Scalia, a lawyer who has represented financial firms in challenges to regulations.
Business and financial-industry groups that have challenged prior regulations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Friday they were reviewing the decision.
While President Biden, a Democrat, campaigned on an aggressive climate agenda, much of the administration's effort to address global warming through legislation has stalled in Congress. That has put greater pressure on regulatory agencies to deliver on a core Democratic priority.
A pending SEC proposal would force publicly traded companies to tally their impact on the environment and the risks they face from climate change. Companies would have to report greenhouse-gas emissions from their own operations as well as from the energy they consume, and obtain independent certification of their estimates. In some cases, companies would be required to report greenhouse-gas output of their supply chains and consumers, known as Scope 3 emissions.
The policy hasn't been made final and is expected to face legal challenges.
"I don't think there's any question that every corporate securities lawyer in America is going to now fashion their arguments against SEC rule-making to force-fit it into the Supreme Court's EPA analysis," said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, which advocates for financial-industry changes. "The trend lines of where the courts are going is putting significant regulatory climate action at risk," he added.
Mr. Kelleher said he would expect the Supreme Court ruling to encourage agencies such as the SEC to write proposed rules more carefully so that they are grounded in specific statutory authorizations.
"They're going to have to prepare to litigate a lot more rules than they were prepared to litigate" before the ruling, he said.
Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at the financial-services firm BTIG, said he expected legal challenges to the proposed SEC rule, but that they would likely come from avenues unrelated to Thursday's Supreme Court decision: "The statutory authority is relatively clear," he said.
Still, he said the ruling would be another way for industry groups to attack new regulations, not just those related to climate. At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for instance, the clearest vulnerability is an expanded supervisory authority to target discrimination, Mr. Boltansky said.
Even before the EPA ruling, Republicans said SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, a Democrat, overreached and questioned whether the SEC has the legal authority to set a climate-disclosure rule.
The EPA ruling could also be used to challenge actions by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has authority over new interstate natural-gas pipelines, said Mr. Brightbill, the former Justice Department lawyer. The commission has drafted policies that would take greenhouse-gas emissions into consideration in determining whether pipelines should be approved. Those policies, if they go into effect, are an obvious area where litigants could invoke the EPA ruling, he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan push to increase U.S. semiconductor production and competitiveness with China has run into further trouble and could cloud companies' investment plans, with the Senate's top Republican tying its fate to a separate climate and prescription-drug budget plan being pursued by Democrats.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Thursday that he is willing to block the China and chips legislation, known as USICA, if Democrats continue those budget talks, which could be passed with just Democratic votes in the 50-50 Senate through a special process called reconciliation.
"Let me be perfectly clear: there will be no bipartisan USICA as long as Democrats are pursuing a partisan reconciliation bill," Mr. McConnell tweeted.
Many aides acknowledge that if they can't land on a deal for either bill by the end of July, the approach of the midterm elections would likely block further progress. Congress is on break and set to return later this month.
Passing the deal after November might be too late for some manufacturers, who have ramped up their calls to Congress to pass legislation quickly. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker, Intel Corp. and Global Foundries Inc. have all issued warnings that delaying the legislation could cause them to scale back their plans to make semiconductors in the U.S.
Many of the states where manufacturers have announced plans are led by Republicans, which could push lawmakers to make a deal. GlobalWafers Co., a Taiwan-based company, said on Monday it plans to build a $5 billion factory in Texas to make silicon wafers used in semiconductors, if Congress approves the bill.
The White House accused Mr. McConnell of "holding hostage a bipartisan package to strengthen American competitiveness versus China."
The China competitiveness legislation has been star-crossed for the better part of a year, in part due to basic differences between the two chambers that passed separate bills and are now trying to blend them. The two chambers included very different approaches to overhauling trade policies to make the U.S. more competitive. The House also added other proposals, including a $45 billion program to help boost other supply chains.
To reach a deal, Democrats have agreed to drop part of the House bill that would authorize $2 billion annually to the Global Climate Change Initiative for improving food security and natural-resource conservation abroad, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Lawmakers and aides maintain they have been closing in on a compromise. The person familiar with the talks said it was 90% hammered out.
"As is common in legislating, there will be bumps in the road," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said after Mr. McConnell's statement.
Democratic and Republican congressional aides saw Mr. McConnell's comment as a sign he was worried that a deal was emerging for the long-stalled budget bill, which Republicans have opposed. The bill has been held up in the Senate after Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) last year blocked a broader, roughly $2 trillion House version of the legislation, formerly known as Build Back Better.
Mr. Manchin has been huddling in recent weeks with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on a party-line package. While those talks have been closely held, some Democrats now expect any agreement between Mr. Schumer and Mr. Manchin to raise roughly $1 trillion in tax revenue with roughly $500 billion in spending. About $500 billion would be dedicated toward reducing the federal budget deficit.
At the heart of the bill's spending would be tax incentives for companies and individuals to reduce their carbon emissions, while the tax increases would likely come from a new minimum tax on corporate book income, a higher minimum tax on multinational corporations' foreign earnings and higher taxes on very-high-income Americans. Mr. Manchin has repeatedly said he supports measures to reduce the price of prescription drugs, and Democrats expect a plan empowering the government to negotiate lower drug prices to be an element of any eventual deal.
Any deal would likely continue a pandemic relief program that lowered health-insurance premiums for plans sold on the Affordable Care Act exchange.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that federal regulators exceeded their authority in seeking to limit emissions from coal plants, a decision that sharply curtails the executive branch's authority to make policy actions on a range of issues without congressional direction.
In a blockbuster 6-3 decision penned by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court said on Thursday that the Environmental Protection Agency had overstepped when it devised the Obama-era regulatory program, the Clean Power Plan. The court said that when federal agencies issue regulations with sweeping economic and political consequences -- in this case, rules to address climate change -- the regulations are presumptively invalid unless Congress has specifically authorized the action.
"A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body," the chief justice wrote, faulting the EPA for finding new powers in "the vague language of a long-extant, but rarely used, statute."
The Clean Power Plan had been challenged by West Virginia and others.
Beyond the EPA, the decision is likely to curb President Biden's ability to use other departments and regulators such as the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address climate change.
Mr. Biden, a Democrat, called the court's ruling "a devastating decision that aims to take our country backwards."
"I have directed my legal team to work with the Department of Justice and affected agencies to review this decision carefully and find ways that we can, under federal law, continue protecting Americans from harmful pollution, including pollution that causes climate change," Mr. Biden said.
The principle articulated by the court, known as the "major questions doctrine," was mentioned in earlier cases but is being recognized more explicitly now, said Gautam Hans, a law professor at Vanderbilt University.
"The court has now really explicitly relied on this doctrine to limit the EPA's authority, and other regulatory agencies are going to be more cautious now that they have to navigate this," Mr. Hans said.
In the face of congressional opposition, Mr. Biden and his Democratic predecessors have used regulation instead of legislation to advance their policy agendas, Mr. Hans said. "Now it's going to be much harder for those agency rules to survive judicial scrutiny," he added.
The EPA ruling is similar to the court's decision on the Biden administration's vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers navigating the Covid-19 pandemic. In that January ruling, the justices said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had exceeded its authority.
"Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly," the majority said in an unsigned opinion.
In both cases, Chief Justice Roberts found support from the other five conservatives: Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
The court's conservatives have increasingly come to invalidate regulatory actions they think amount to new national policies that should be determined by legislators.
"This Court has established at least one firm rule: 'We expect Congress to speak clearly' if it wishes to assign to an executive agency decisions 'of vast economic and political significance,'" Justice Gorsuch wrote in January.
The National Mining Association, which was part of West Virginia's coalition, said the battle was over federal authority. "While many would have liked to label this as a case about climate, it is not; it is a case about the authority of government agencies and the economic impacts to the states and all Americans when that authority is abused," the group said.
Scott Nelson, an attorney with Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer-advocacy group, said the ruling would hurt consumers by undercutting federal agencies' attempts to protect them, while giving businesses and others a wide, new lane to challenge them.
"I would tend to expect that any kind of regulatory initiative that anybody has a stake in opposing is going to be characterized as a major question," Mr. Nelson said.
Most immediately, opponents are likely to bring up the issue in litigation against vaccine mandates for federal employees, he said. An SEC proposal for climate-risk and emissions disclosures is another initiative that might be legally vulnerable because some justices might consider the topic odd for oversight from a financial regulator, he said.
For half a century, the Clean Air Act has directed the EPA to regulate stationary sources of air pollution that endanger "public health or welfare." The Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which never went into effect because it was blocked by the Supreme Court in an earlier case, extended that regulatory reach beyond the physical premises of a power plant to allow off-site methods to mitigate pollution.
The Trump administration implemented in 2019 a replacement rule that was more friendly to the coal industry. But on the last day of Donald Trump's presidency, a federal appeals court in the District of Columbia struck down the replacement rule.
In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the Obama-era EPA had exercised broad authority given to it by Congress. In 2007, rejecting arguments from the George W. Bush administration, the court ruled that greenhouse gases were subject to regulation as pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
"Today, the Court strips the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the power Congress gave it to respond to 'the most pressing environmental challenge of our time,'" she wrote, citing the 2007 opinion.
"The Court appoints itself -- instead of Congress or the expert agency -- the decision maker on climate policy," she wrote in her dissent, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.
The decision is a warning to agencies that they should be wary of interpreting old laws to give them broad new powers, said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. "Finding dormant regulatory authority in pre-existing statutes is something the court disfavors," he said.

Full text: PARIS -- A United Nations agreement to accelerate greenhouse-gas cuts this year has stalled, according to some negotiators, as most of the world's biggest emitters have done little to follow through on the deal since it was struck seven months ago at the climate summit in Glasgow.
The surge in global energy prices and the war in Ukraine have prompted major economies to increase their investments in fossil fuels. China, the world's biggest carbon-dioxide emitter, produced more coal than ever last year and approved plans this year to build at least five new coal-fired power plants. In the U.S., gridlock in Congress has stymied the Biden administration's climate legislation.
The lack of progress cast a shadow over climate negotiations this month in Bonn, Germany, that ended Thursday. In Glasgow, negotiators struck a deal on a number of technical issues, including broad rules for an international market in carbon credits. But they couldn't agree on how to cut emissions in line with the Paris climate accord of 2015.
Instead, the Glasgow pact left the details to be hammered out in future meetings in Bonn and elsewhere. Analysts and some officials now see little prospect that will happen before the next U.N. climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in November.

Full text: Environmental groups sued the Biden administration, saying that its decision to approve more than 3,500 oil and natural-gas drilling permits in New Mexico and Wyoming violated environmental laws by not taking into account the impact on climate change.
In their lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the conservation nonprofits Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians say the approved oil and gas wells will release as much as 600 million metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions, worsening climate change and damaging U.S. ecosystems.
The federal permitting agency "has admitted that continued oil and gas exploitation is a significant cause of the climate crisis, yet the agency continues to recklessly issue thousands of new oil and gas drilling permits," said Kyle Tisdel, climate and energy program director with the Western Environmental Law Center, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the nonprofits.
The groups said that the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to account for how approving the permits would affect the climate and nearby communities. They also said Bureau of Land Management officials failed to prevent "unnecessary and undue degradation of public lands," a requirement of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act.
Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz declined to comment on the lawsuit.
The lawsuit is unlikely to have an immediate effect on U.S. energy prices. While the groups asked a judge to declare the permits to be unlawfully granted and to invalidate them, they didn't ask the court to immediately stop drilling-related activity under the permits.
Roughly 10% of U.S. oil and gas production comes from federal land.

Full text: Companies are beefing up their finance teams and testing new technology as they prepare for potential rules from U.S. securities regulators on climate-risk and emissions disclosures.
The Securities and Exchange Commission in March presented a proposal that would require public companies to report their greenhouse-gas emissions for the first time and, in some cases, provide that information for their suppliers and customers. Companies would have to seek independent certification of certain disclosures and reveal how climate-related risks may materially affect their businesses. The comment period for the proposal ends this week.
Hundreds, if not thousands, of U.S. companies already disclose some kind of climate-related information, often lacking comparability, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said at an event Thursday. "There's some fragmented approach to this," he said.
Chief financial officers expect that complying with the proposed rule would be costly. "We understood that when the SEC started talking about [the rule], that this was going to be a lot of work and you're not going to do it with arms and legs," said Sameer Ralhan, the CFO of chemical producer Chemours Co., referring to the need for technology to tackle potential new disclosure requirements.
Chemours last year began adding resources to its finance team, including personnel and technology, to make certain climate-related disclosures by the third quarter of next year, Mr. Ralhan said.
The company recruited people with analytical capabilities, including a controller for environmental, social and governance issues, Mr. Ralhan said. Currently, Chemours is looking for an assistant controller for ESG accounting who will help with ensuring the company meets stakeholders' and regulators' expectations on climate change and other reporting, according to a LinkedIn post. The company said the role hasn't been filled yet. Mr. Ralhan declined to disclose the number of roles added to the finance team.
Some companies said they welcome the SEC's rule-making effort, as it could result in publicly available information that can be compared across companies. How that benefit will stack up against the costs, however, depends on what the final rule requires, said Baris Oran, CFO of GXO Logistics Inc., a supply-chain and warehousing-logistics company. Even though there isn't a final rule yet, GXO is "actively hiring" for sustainability roles. This includes three hires in the past year and efforts to add a director to the ESG team, according to Mr. Oran.
The SEC estimates the cost of compliance with its proposed rule during the first year would be around $640,000 for large companies, with continuing annual costs predicted to drop to $530,000.
The cost for companies could easily be higher than the SEC's estimates, said Amy Lynch, president of regulatory and compliance consulting firm FrontLine Compliance LLC and a former accountant at the SEC. Regulators' cost predictions tend to underestimate the spend on coming up to speed with new obligations, Ms. Lynch said.

Full text: In the past two months, businesses and investors have pledged roughly $2 billion to back emerging technologies that promise to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is seen as crucial to limiting climate change.
The commitments to the nascent industry of carbon removal have boosted its financial backing by about 30 times. The promised cash is turning carbon removal into a hotbed of technical and financial innovation.
One company raised more than the entire industry in its history. Carbon removal is growing its funding at a faster rate than any other climate sector, a Wall Street Journal analysis of PitchBook data shows.
Sucking carbon out of the atmosphere and permanently storing it underground eliminates some of the greenhouse gases that have driven Earth's temperature higher. That process has never been done on a large scale.
In the past few months, tech giants like Google and Facebook, consulting firms McKinsey and BCG, financial firms UBS and Swiss Re, plus the royal family of Liechtenstein, have promised to pay generously for carbon that is removed from the atmosphere and stored.
By committing in advance to pay companies that succeed, the backers are creating the same types of incentives used to fund research for vaccines for diseases like malaria and for big-dollar infrastructure projects like liquefied-natural-gas terminals.
The plans to boost carbon removal address the fact that efforts to reduce carbon emissions have fallen short of what is necessary to prevent dangerous changes to Earth's climate. The current scramble for fossil fuels caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made clear that a transition to renewable energy is a long way away.
Carbon-removal technologies suck carbon out of the open air in order to lock it away for centuries. There are a jumble of names for efforts to reduce carbon in the atmosphere. Direct-air capture, a common description of the strategy, is one type of carbon removal. Carbon capture, which grabs carbon from smokestacks and other denser sources of greenhouse gases, is related but seen as a different process. Carbon removal is more technologically demanding because the carbon dioxide is more diffuse in the atmosphere.
Companies are willing to pay for carbon removal to meet the goal of becoming carbon neutral. Many companies try to get there by buying carbon credits, which are usually generated by renewable energy and forest preservation. Many companies have decided that directly removing carbon is more effective.
In April, Google parent Alphabet Inc., Facebook operator Meta Platforms Inc., McKinsey & Co., payments processor Stripe Inc. and Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify Inc. committed nearly $1 billion to pay for carbon removal through 2030 in a joint venture called Frontier. A similar group of UBS Group AG, Boston Consulting Group and others expects to spend hundreds of millions of dollars. Microsoft Corp. and Salesforce Inc. made separate pledges totaling $300 million.
Businesses have committed roughly $1.5 billion in recent weeks. Before that, they had pledged some $50 million.
The long-term commitments are being bolstered by investments in existing carbon-removal companies. Climeworks AG, a Swiss company whose Iceland facility is one of the world's only operational projects, privately raised $650 million. That's more than the entire industry raised in its history.
Other upstarts recently raised tens of millions from investors including Bill Gates's Breakthrough Energy Ventures and an innovation competition bankrolled by Elon Musk.
The money is fueling a race among startups to develop new removal methods. Some, like Climeworks, build machines that bring air into contact with chemicals that absorb and transform the carbon dioxide so it can be stored underground. Others envision accelerating natural processes that lock up carbon in rocks or oceans.
Many environmentalists and business leaders question the wisdom of betting on unproven technology that will consume energy, land and money to fight climate change. Reducing emissions should be the main focus, they argue.
"There's this deep-rooted fear that the foot will come off the gas pedal on emissions reductions if carbon removal is successful," said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a climate adviser to the United Nations secretary-general.
Speculative technology is common in Silicon Valley, but the pace and structure of investments in removal set it apart. Demand for carbon removal outweighs supply by so much that the sector's capacity is sold out years into the future. That has forced the companies to commit to paying for removals that haven't happened yet using technologies that haven't been invented yet.
These commitments are being made at far higher prices than the carbon credits typically bought by companies. But industry executives say it will be hard to raise enough cash without a consistent price or tax on carbon.
"It's a leap of faith that people will come around to the math," said Peter Reinhardt, chief executive of San Francisco removal firm Charm Industrial. Mr. Reinhardt sold his last company, customer-data platform Segment, to Twilio Inc. for $3.2 billion.
Charm heats up agricultural plant waste like corn stalks to turn it into carbon-rich liquid that can be injected into wells underground. That "bio-oil" can be stored for about $600 a ton, a price the company hopes to cut by improving its technology.
Charm says it put more than 5,000 tons of carbon dioxide underground last year for customers including Stripe and Microsoft. It has raised about $25 million from investors including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Lowercarbon Capital.
Lowercarbon was launched by venture capitalists Chris and Crystal Sacca and recently raised a $350 million fund to invest in carbon-removal startups.
Industry executives hope for a future where people pay for carbon removal like they pay for trash collection and drinking water. To make that point, Jan Wurzbacher, co-CEO of Climeworks, threw 10-pound trash bags on stage during a talk a few years ago in London.
The involvement of the fossil fuel industry has raised additional concerns among skeptics. Occidental Petroleum Corp., which has one of the most ambitious carbon-removal plans, says it will spend up to $1 billion on a direct-air-capture facility with Canadian startup Carbon Engineering Ltd. The facility would bury some of the carbon underground and use some to produce oil. Airbus SE agreed to purchase carbon credits linked to the project, and United Airlines Holdings Inc. is among its investors.
The carbon-removal industry is tiny, with less than $5 million in revenue last year. That figure will need to reach about $1 trillion by midcentury, scientists say.
"We need to keep adding zeros to this until we get carbon removal at the scale that we need it to be," said Nan Ransohoff, Stripe's head of climate.

Full text: SUVA, Fiji -- The latest struggle between China and the U.S. for influence in the Pacific ended with a setback for Beijing when its top diplomat couldn't secure a regional agreement to deepen security and trade ties with more than half a dozen Pacific countries.
But in this island nation, where Chinese money has recently helped to build roads and skyscrapers, top officials warn that Washington's status as a key power broker in the region could slip if it doesn't step up its efforts.
"They can do a lot more in Fiji," said Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Fiji's attorney general, from his office overlooking a stretch of tropical ocean. "It's not only about having McDonald's in Fiji."
The Pacific, with its key shipping lanes, fisheries and strategic position, has emerged as a hot spot in the great power rivalry between the U.S. and China. And nowhere has diplomacy been as intense as in Fiji, a nation of nearly a million people and whose capital, Suva, has been called the New York of the Pacific.
The visit by Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China, who fist-bumped Fijian officials as he strode down a red carpet at an airport near Suva, capped a flurry of recent diplomatic activity. In February, Fiji hosted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the first visit by a sitting secretary of state in nearly 40 years. Kurt Campbell, the National Security Council's coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, visited in April, and days before Mr. Wang's visit, Australia's new foreign minister, Penny Wong, arrived.
The jet-setting shows that the U.S. and its allies know they need to strengthen their relationships with Pacific countries, whose friendships have been based on a shared but increasingly distant history of fighting together in World War II.
"I will acknowledge, for the U.S. to increase its game, we need to do a better job at increasing our bilateral engagement," said Tony Greubel, the charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Fiji and currently the top diplomat in the country.
What's not clear is if those efforts can blunt China's campaign for closer ties in the region, which is raising concerns that Beijing could eventually establish a military presence in strategically important islands near U.S. territory. China has denied it intends to set up a military base.
"We see China everywhere," said Netani Rika, a former editor of the Fiji Times, one of the country's main media outlets, pointing out that an unfinished, Chinese-financed skyscraper in Suva is hard to miss. "That is a symbol of China's visibility."
Chinese officials have said their overtures aren't a threat to any nation and are aimed at helping fellow developing countries grow their economies.
The U.S. was involved with building infrastructure during the war, and many Pacific airports began as airstrips for military use. China, however, has pushed hard in recent decades to enhance its standing, filling a gap in infrastructure financing and deepening relationships with Pacific leaders, some political observers said.
Washington has always been committed to the Pacific, according to U.S. officials, though it has become more of a focus recently.
In February, Mr. Blinken released an Indo-Pacific strategy that called for more diplomatic and security resources to be allocated to the Pacific. The Biden administration has also built alliances to counter China's influence, including an economic platform called the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. In one diplomatic victory for the U.S., Fiji was the first Pacific island nation to join the group.
Mr. Greubel said the U.S. will be adding staff at the embassy -- which serves five countries, including Fiji -- and is looking at opening embassies in some countries where it currently doesn't have a diplomatic presence. He said more staff will be arriving for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which will intensify work to help Pacific countries deal with climate change and could expand to areas such as economic development, education and healthcare.
Mr. Greubel said the U.S. already contributes to multilateral institutions that provide aid and financing to Pacific nations; offers equipment and training opportunities to Fiji's military, which is active in United Nations peacekeeping missions; supports people-to-people exchanges; and helped to provide vaccines and other public-health support during the pandemic. Looking ahead, he said, Washington could provide more opportunities for people in the Pacific to study or train in the U.S.
"We have a brand," said Mr. Greubel, noting that many of Fiji's tourist hotels are American chains and that the U.S. is Fiji's biggest export market. "We have a lot of soft power."
One problem with the U.S. strategy of offering financing through multilateral forums is that when a project gets funding, it is unclear that it is U.S. money, said people involved with international development in the region.
U.S. standing was also hurt when the Trump administration quit the Paris climate accord, making it appear the U.S. wasn't serious about climate change, which many in the Pacific consider an existential threat, the people said.
Although Mr. Wang, China's foreign minister, didn't secure a wide-ranging regional agreement at a summit with Pacific leaders in Fiji, China still signed bilateral economic agreements with some nations during his recent tour of the region. That includes Kiribati, which in 2019 switched diplomatic ties to Beijing from Taipei.
In Fiji, where Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama faces an election within months, some of his rivals said they worry about China's influence. Sitiveni Rabuka, seen as Mr. Bainimarama's main opponent, said he would bring Fiji closer to its traditional Western allies.
Many people here remain partial to the U.S. Jay Colati, a 29-year-old bartender in Suva, said he favors the U.S. over China given Fiji's shared history with Western nations. But he said the U.S. should be more visible in the Pacific.
"All we see is the Chinese flag all over," he said.

Full text: The next front in the fight over the future of coal could be a portfolio of power plants up for sale in Southeast Asia.
South Korea's majority-state-owned power company said in May that it would sell all its overseas coal assets, part of a sweeping cost-cutting plan. The proposal raises a recurring question: What should happen to coal plants that contribute to climate change but still have decades of operational life ahead of them? The dilemma is playing out in Australia, where a technology billionaire wants to shut down coal plants decades ahead of schedule, and in tensions over who should fund South Africa's energy transition.
Korea Electric Power Corp. owns energy assets around the world, including a 200-megawatt coal plant in the Philippines, stakes in two 1.2-gigawatt plants in Vietnam, one of which is being built, and a stake in a 2-gigawatt plant in Indonesia, also in development.
A Kepco spokeswoman said the company plans to sell the Philippines plant this year but it could take until 2030 to sell all the assets. Buyers haven't been identified, she said. Climate change will be a factor in the process, she added, saying Kepco "follows the Korean government's carbon-neutrality policy" but declining to elaborate.
Legislation passed last year commits South Korea to be carbon-neutral by 2050 and cut emissions by 30% from 2018 levels by 2035.
Experts on Southeast Asia's energy transition said the assets are a bellwether. They could be sold to conventional buyers seeking to maximize returns from burning coal. They could also be targets for new investment initiatives that want to retire coal plants early. The proposed sale "could be a good chance for multilateral development banks and national development finance institutions to jump in," said Joojin Kim, managing director of Solutions for Our Climate, a Seoul-based advocacy group.
At last year's COP26 climate summit, the Asian Development Bank, a lender owned by governments from Asia, the U.S. and elsewhere, launched a project seeking to retire coal plants in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Called the Energy Transition Mechanism, the project plans to provide coal plants with low-cost financing from the ADB and private firms on the condition that they wind down a decade or more earlier than they would have done otherwise. It also wants to facilitate funding for clean energy.
David Elzinga, a senior energy specialist at ADB who is working on the Energy Transition Mechanism, said Kepco's assets could be suitable targets for the initiative, although it is too early to say how the process will pan out. "We see this as an opportunity to engage in the sales in a way that can accelerate the retirement of the coal plants," he said.
Mr. Elzinga said the Energy Transition Mechanism is working toward its first transactions, with the biggest push involving privately and publicly owned power plants in Indonesia. It hopes to announce deals by the November Group of 20 summit in Indonesia, where the energy transition will be a focus of the gathering, and close them next year. The group originally considered buying plants outright but now wants to structure deals so that current equity owners retain a diminished equity stake, Mr. Elzinga added.
The ADB isn't the only group working on financing the coal phaseout. The Climate Investment Funds, another multilateral lender, launched a separate platform looking at the same puzzle, while a coalition of nonprofit organizations with philanthropic backing from the IKEA Foundation and others is working on another effort. The projects were announced late last year but haven't announced deals.
Such transactions would be complicated. Power plants often have multiple owners. Financial firms, under pressure to divest themselves of fossil-fuel assets, may decline to participate. To benefit the climate, the plans would have to be combined with efforts to add cleaner energy. The financial engineers would also have to determine that the plants would really have continued emitting if the deal hadn't happened.
Mr. Elzinga said power-plant operators typically benefit from long-term power-purchase agreements that guarantee them a buyer for their power for decades, making it easier to know when they will stop operating. "Those plants are locked in," he said.
Despite efforts to cut emissions, coal-fired power generation is rising. Southeast Asia's power generation has almost tripled since 2000, with the largest increase coming from coal, according to the International Energy Agency. Countries across the region announced more ambitious climate targets last year, but they aren't on track to reduce emissions in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord, the IEA said in a recent report.
Kepco's planned sale is part of an effort to raise 6 trillion Korean won, equivalent to roughly $4.8 billion, through asset sales and cost cutting. It was announced after Kepco reported a record quarterly operating loss of 7.8 trillion won for the first quarter, driven by rising energy prices that the state-owned company couldn't pass on to customers.
BlackRock Inc. and other investors have criticized Kepco over its coal stance. Mr. Kim at Solutions for Our Climate said the company's current woes present an opportunity to force it to accelerate its shift toward clean energy. He said the state-owned Korea Development Bank, one of Kepco's shareholders, is another potential buyer for the overseas assets that could help engineer an early shutdown. The bank didn't respond to requests for comment.

Full text: New Environmental Protection Agency rules promise to give a significant boost to what is becoming known as the methane mitigation industry.
The pending rules, which require oil-and-gas companies to cut leaks of methane gas, could lift the bottom line of companies that produce the equipment needed for compliance, including such oil-field service giants as Schlumberger Ltd., Baker Hughes Co. and Honeywell International Inc.
The EPA rules are expected to be finalized within the next year and would affect hundreds of thousands of wells, storage tanks and natural-gas processing plants. They could require companies to replace leaky, older equipment and buy new monitoring tools to sharply reduce emissions of methane, a planet-warming gas that traps more heat than carbon dioxide.
The proposed regulations have divided the U.S. oil-and-gas industry. Broadly supporting the initiative is the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group that represents Honeywell, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes as well as large oil-and-gas producers who are already investing in ways to leakproof their operations. They have backed issuance of new rules while asking the EPA to change parts of the proposal.
Smaller well operators generally oppose the EPA's plans, saying they won't be able to afford the compliance costs. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents thousands of companies in the oil-and-gas-extraction business, said the EPA rules would raise the costs of operating low-production wells, which pull less than 15 barrels of oil or an equivalent of natural gas a day and contribute about 10% of U.S. production.
The association told the EPA that shutting down such wells could hurt local economies. "While the citizens of these rural parts of the country are certainly concerned with the 'climate and health impacts of pollution' . . . they are also concerned with their livelihood and putting food on the table," the letter said, referencing a phrase EPA used to describe the rule's benefits.
The EPA has proposed some exceptions for smaller wells. Still, the agency has estimated that 280,000 well sites will be affected when the new monitoring requirements are expected to go into effect in 2026.
Agency officials and climate activists say producers can sell captured methane gas, but that incentive hasn't been enough to get companies to cut emissions. EPA researchers estimate that natural-gas systems emitted roughly 6.6 million tons of methane into the atmosphere in 2020. That is the second-largest source, besides methane from livestock digestion.
In March, Schlumberger announced a new business unit dedicated to helping customers cut methane emissions, which Chief Technology Officer Demos Pafitis called "one of the most pressing issues of climate change."
The regulations could drive business for smaller suppliers, too. One proposed requirement is that some major storage tanks capture nearly all their methane emissions. Flogistix LP, which makes devices that capture methane rising to the top of liquid storage tanks, has an order list reaching into next year and is planning on tripling manufacturing capacity this summer by opening a factory in rural El Reno, Okla., said Chief Executive Mims Talton.
Investors are pressuring producers to capture and sell more methane, but the proposal could boost sales an additional 20%, Mr. Talton estimated. "There are companies that won't do anything without encouragement," he said. The company's vapor-recovery device costs between $80,000 and $450,000.
Other proposals call for outright replacement of leaky equipment, such as pneumatic devices that release natural gas into the atmosphere every time they move a valve to control tank pressure and liquid levels. Regulators estimate there are roughly 1.6 million such devices in use.
The rules are also expected to require more frequent monitoring for methane leaks.
That could be a boon for Arkansas-based Montrose Environmental Group Inc., which is looking to the rules to drive demand for the inspection services of its engineers, field technicians and scientists, CEO Vijay Manthripragada said.
"We sit between the regulators and the regulated," he said.
Honeywell, Baker Hughes and several other companies that sell surveillance systems that continuously monitor for methane leaks are lobbying for the EPA to endorse their technology as an option for compliance. In-person, periodic inspections with hand-held devices are time-consuming and can be thrown off by the weather or human error, they said in a joint letter to the EPA.
Kuva Systems began selling its surveillance systems last year. Chief Executive Stefan Bokaemper said he is preparing to transfer camera manufacturing from the 32-person company's Cambridge, Mass., headquarters to a contract manufacturer, anticipating higher volumes.
More than 200 companies are in the business of finding, preventing or fixing methane emissions, including startups and longtime manufacturers, according to a 2021 report from the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group that supports stricter rules.
Robert Kleinberg, a former oil-and-gas industry engineer who studies the intersection of technology and regulation at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, said capturing escaped methane largely poses a more welcome challenge for oil-and-gas producers than cutting carbon dioxide. Making more airtight natural-gas systems, he said, is easier.

Full text: The 2022 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to show "above normal" activity, with an estimated 14 to 21 named storms, up to 10 hurricanes and as many as six major hurricanes, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday.
The forecast outlines a hurricane season that would fall short of the most active one on record, in 2020, which had 30 named storms. Still, it would be the seventh consecutive above-normal year on record, said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad.
Warm seasonal sea-surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea are expected to contribute to the activity this season, which starts June 1 and runs through November. Typically, 90% of storms in the region occur after August 1.
An average Atlantic hurricane season -- defined by NOAA as storm frequency averaged between 1991 and 2020 -- produces 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes, of which three are classified as major hurricanes.
NOAA names tropical storms when their winds hit speeds of 39 miles an hour or higher. Storms whose winds reach 74 miles an hour or faster are classified as hurricanes. The most intense of those, characterized by winds of at least 111 miles an hour, are upgraded to major hurricane status.
NOAA's calculations consider millions of data points measured across months, said Matthew Rosencrans, the agency's lead for the seasonal hurricane outlook. These include surface sea temperatures collected by buoys, atmospheric temperature measurements taken by weather balloons and humidity levels measured by satellites.
NOAA also considers the influence of global weather and climate patterns. For example, an intense monsoon season off the coast of West Africa creates ideal conditions for storms in the Atlantic to form. Also, alternating "El Nino" heating and "La Nina" cooling conditions in the Pacific, known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, influence how many storms develop.
The agency pointed to the current cool La Nina Pacific conditions, which are linked with more-active hurricane years, and a strong west African monsoon season, as key factors influencing the activity of this year's hurricane season.
A team at Colorado State University issued a similar forecast in April, predicting 19 named storms for the season. Nine of those are expected to grow to hurricanes, the team said, with four likely to intensify further to major hurricane strength.
Climate change is supercharging hurricanes, according to scientists of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as NOAA and other national monitoring agencies. Heat-trapping greenhouse gases are warming the atmosphere, which in turn heats the ocean. Warmer ocean temperatures fuel more powerful and destructive storms, which bring more storm surge and dump more rain.
In 2020, the annual global sea-surface temperature was 0.76 degree Celsius above the 20th century's average, equivalent to 1.37 degrees Fahrenheit.
"One of the clear indicators of climate-change impact on hurricanes is really coming through the changes in rainfall," said Kevin Reed, associate dean for research at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University in New York, who studies climate and extreme weather events.
During the record-breaking 2020 season, Atlantic storms dumped 10% more rain over hourly intervals than they would have in the absence of climate change, according to an April study in the journal Nature Communications co-written by Dr. Reed.
Hurricane Harvey, which in 2017 inundated parts of Texas with more than 50 inches of rain, was 15% wetter than it would have been without climate change effects, according to a December 2017 study in Environmental Research Letters that examined the warming climate's contribution to that event.
Changing global temperatures may also be shifting the paths of tropical storms poleward, according to a January study in the journal Nature Geoscience. Temperate regions that saw hurricanes only rarely are likely to experience them more frequently, that analysis found.

Full text: HSBC Holdings PLC suspended a senior executive who argued that investors didn't need to worry about climate change and that policy makers were exaggerating the risks, according to people familiar with the matter.
The comments made by Stuart Kirk, the head of responsible investment and research at HSBC Asset Management, have drawn criticism from the bank's chief executive as well as from environmental activists.
Mr. Kirk is being suspended while the bank undertakes an investigation, one of the people said.
A spokesperson for HSBC declined to comment. Mr. Kirk didn't respond to requests for comment.
The London-based bank has sought to position itself as a leader in sustainable finance, with initiatives such as a pledge to provide as much as $1 trillion of financing by 2030 to help borrowers cut their carbon emissions. HSBC has said its asset-management arm "treats climate change risk as a key feature of the investment decision-making process."
Last Thursday, Mr. Kirk gave a presentation titled "Why investors need not worry about climate risk" at a conference organized by the Financial Times. He said that markets appeared to share his attitude and one of his slides was headed: "Unsubstantiated, shrill, partisan, self-serving, apocalyptic warnings are ALWAYS wrong." The Financial Times earlier reported Mr. Kirk's suspension.
He argued that the financial and lifestyle effects of climate change would be "de minimis," given economic growth and societal adaptation.
"Human beings have been fantastic at adapting to change, adapting to climate emergencies and we will continue to do so. Who cares if Miami is six meters underwater in a hundred years? Amsterdam's been six meters underwater for ages and that's a really nice place," he said.
"Twenty-five years in the finance industry, there's always some nutjob telling me about the end of the world," said Mr. Kirk, recalling late-1990s worries about the Y2K computer bug.
"Central banks are particularly annoying because they haven't spent enough time worrying about inflation and growth and why it's going out of control, and have spent way too much time on climate risk," he added, querying how those institutions modeled related stress tests.
Mr. Kirk has previously worked at Deutsche Bank and the Financial Times, and was hired by HSBC in late 2020.
Banks, asset managers and other financial institutions have come under pressure in recent years from investors and environmental activists to focus on climate change. The finance industry has been incorporating environmental, social and governance, or ESG, criteria into its models for investing, while some banks have been scaling back their lending to companies involved with fossil fuels. Trillions of dollars are being put toward climate-oriented funds and projects.
Senior figures at HSBC criticized Mr. Kirk's analysis.
His remarks "are inconsistent with HSBC's strategy and do not reflect the views of the senior leadership of HSBC or HSBC Asset Management," Chief Executive Noel Quinn wrote on LinkedIn. "Our ambition is to be the leading bank supporting the global economy in the transition to net zero."

Full text: MOGO, Australia -- Since Australia's 2019 election, hairdresser Naomi Lafranchi's salon in this small town narrowly survived devastating wildfires, only to be flooded when heavy rains hit.
Ms. Lafranchi didn't vote for anyone last time, but now she plans to support the Labor Party, the center-left opposition, when Australians head to the polls this weekend.
"It rains and you're instantly freaking out about what's going to happen," said Ms. Lafranchi, 37, who at one point was driving to the salon during the night to check water levels in the nearby creeks. Ms. Lafranchi is voting for Labor because she credits her electorate's parliamentary representative, from the Labor Party, for pushing to get government grants to help flood-hit businesses.
Australia's election campaign has been dominated by the economy and inflation. But the country has been hit by so many high-profile natural disasters -- first fires, then floods -- that climate change will play a role in how many Australians vote in Saturday's election. Scientists say disasters such as fires and floods are becoming more frequent and intense because of rising global temperatures, and that Australia is particularly vulnerable because it has a very variable climate.
The election pits Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his center-right governing coalition, which includes Mr. Morrison's Liberal Party and the right-leaning Nationals, against the Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese. Both sides have committed to achieve net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, though Labor has a more ambitious 2030 target.
Mr. Morrison has been prime minister for nearly four years and his coalition has been in power since 2013, but he is trailing in the polls. Still, Mr. Morrison was down in the polls before the 2019 election and came back to win, so some analysts say he has a chance to pull off another upset.
About 93,000 square miles were burned, an area bigger than Minnesota, 33 people were killed and more than 3,000 homes were destroyed in Australia's 2019-20 fires, which attracted global attention for weeks. Since then, two consecutive years of La Nina weather patterns have produced cooler and wetter conditions, with some towns flooding multiple times just weeks apart. This year's flooding has caused a record $2.3 billion in insured losses, estimates the Insurance Council of Australia, which represents the insurance industry.
After years of debate, Mr. Morrison committed Australia -- a big coal exporter -- to net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 late last year, just before attending a global climate conference in Glasgow. Many of the countries that sent delegates to the conference had made a similar net-zero pledge much earlier.
Mr. Morrison's Liberal Party says its net-zero plan is focused on technology and will preserve existing industries, and that Australia is on track to beat its existing 2030 target. The latest projections show an emissions reduction of 30% to 35% compared with 2005 levels, versus a target seeking a 26% to 28% reduction, according to the Liberals.
In comparison, Mr. Albanese's Labor Party wants to achieve a 43% reduction by 2030, including by boosting investment in renewable energy, modernizing Australia's energy grid and focusing more on electric vehicles.
Some business and environmental groups argue stronger action is needed. One environmental organization, the Climate Council, is advocating for a 75% reduction in emissions by 2030. And the Business Council of Australia, an association of corporate leaders that promotes business-friendly policies that often align with the conservatives, has campaigned to lift the 2030 target to a 46% to 50% reduction, pointing out that many of Australia's major trading partners are shifting their economies away from imports such as coal.
Mr. Morrison has tried to steer the election campaign toward other topics, such as the economy and national security, rather than climate change.
That political strategy is risky. In some affluent suburban seats in Australia's largest cities, which are electorates that would traditionally lean conservative but where voters are becoming increasingly concerned about climate policy, climate-focused independents are putting up a stiff challenge to Mr. Morrison's Liberals. If those independents win just a couple of seats, it could give them the power to help determine which party takes control.
But Labor's Mr. Albanese has also been reluctant to make climate change a big issue. Labor had a more ambitious climate policy in the last election in 2019 but lost votes in some areas where people were worried they could lose jobs in the fossil-fuel industry.

Full text: A group of Republican senators is looking to curtail the power big asset managers like BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group have over public companies.
In legislation introduced Wednesday, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R., Alaska) calls for voting choice to be made available to individual investors in passive funds when money managers own more than 1% of a company's voting securities.
Big asset managers like BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Corp. have grown rapidly in recent years, fueled by investors hoping that index-tracking funds can get them broader access to the market at a lower cost. Collectively, those three firms alone manage $20 trillion in assets.
One unexpected consequence of their growth is the huge voting power these firms have accumulated, since they typically vote on behalf of investors. They have pushed companies to improve diversity, cut their climate emissions, and embrace other changes, sometimes drawing criticism from conservatives who say their votes represent a creeping liberal bias.
"Look, this is not an attack against these companies or their executives from the perspective of what they have been able to achieve," Mr. Sullivan said, highlighting passive funds' lower fees and greater diversification as benefits to investors. The bill is co-sponsored by 11 other Republican senators. It so far doesn't have any support from Democrats, who control the Senate.
Mr. Sullivan said he started looking at the asset managers after speaking with leaders in the Alaskan energy sector, who told him shareholder resolutions from climate activists had put pressure on their businesses.
In 2020, BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink steered the firm to consider environmental, social and governance risks as consequential as credit and liquidity risk. In a letter at the time, he said climate change "has become a defining factor in companies' long-term prospects." Mr. Fink has said that BlackRock's positions are about long-term returns, not politics.
In October, BlackRock announced it was developing technology to expand proxy voting choices for its clients. Some institutional investors in BlackRock are now able to vote their shares.
A BlackRock spokesman said Wednesday that the firm looks forward "to working with members of Congress and others on ways to help every investor -- including individual investors -- participate in proxy voting if they choose."
A Vanguard spokeswoman said the firm "believes it is important to give investors more of a voice in how their proxies are voted."
State Street declined to comment.

Full text: The cost of proposed rules on climate disclosure is emerging as a key battleground as businesses and politicians fight over a plan to require companies to tally their impact on the environment and the risks they face from climate change.
The Securities and Exchange Commission estimates the plan will raise the cost to businesses to comply with its disclosure rules from $3.9 billion to $10.2 billion. The leap in expense equates to a continuing additional cost of $420,000 a year on average for a small publicly listed company and $530,000 a year for a bigger firm, the SEC said.
The costs are a rough estimate and are high because they require companies to disclose data that some haven't measured before on their climate impact and the risks that climate change poses to them.
Critics of new regulations often say costs will be too onerous. Some supporters of the SEC's proposed rules say that many companies are already providing this data to investors and that standardizing the numbers will save investors money.
Under the rule, companies will for the first time be required to report their greenhouse-gas emissions including, in certain cases, those from their suppliers and customers. Some climate data will have to be independently audited. Companies will also have to analyze the impact of climate risks from things like flooding and drought on their audited financial statements.
"This climate rule-making is unlike anything I've seen in my 25-year career in securities law, in the breadth and scope of the proposals," said David Lynn, a partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster and former senior SEC official. "It is standing up a whole new disclosure regime."
For companies that are starting from scratch in reporting climate data, complying with the rules could be more expensive than the SEC estimates.
It will involve creating new systems to collect, analyze and report the data needed and potentially hiring new staff, consultants and auditors, Mr. Lynn said. He said the costs are difficult to estimate and could be well higher than the SEC believes.
The SEC declined to comment.
The climate proposal isn't the most expensive new SEC rule. The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley reforms' requirement for rigorous internal controls cost smaller companies about $630,000 a year, based on 2011 survey data updated to today's prices, according to Michael Ewens, a finance professor at the California Institute of Technology. That is one and a half times the estimated climate-rule cost for smaller companies.
Lawmakers, companies, investors and green groups are adopting sharply different positions in their responses to the SEC's consultation on its proposals, which the agency last week extended to mid-June.
Supporters of the proposal say investors need clear, consistent information to judge whether climate change will hurt their returns.
The losses suffered by investors in PG&E Corp. show the risks.
The California utility filed for bankruptcy in 2019 after being overwhelmed by liabilities from wildfires linked to climate change.
"Climate change threatens the value of investments across the board," BankFWD, a green campaign group, said in its comments to the SEC.

Full text: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say they have found a potent new tool in the fight against global warming. It is basically cat litter.
They soaked an odor-eating clay used in cat boxes in a copper solution to create a compound that they say pulls methane from passing air and turns it into carbon dioxide, a much less harmful greenhouse gas.
The Energy Department gave the researchers $2 million to design devices with the compound that can be attached to vents at coal mines and dairy barns, which are big methane emitters. The idea is to alter the chemistry of emissions before they hit the open air, like a catalytic converter on a car.
MIT's researchers say their findings have the potential to greatly reduce the amount of methane in the atmosphere and slow warming temperatures. The discovery could also create another possible application for zeolite, a clay used to clean up some of humankind's nastiest messes, from driveway oil spills to the 2011 meltdown at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.
Zeolite's magic is in its tiny pores, which enable it to function as a filter or a sponge, depending on the chemistry. It is used to strengthen cement, improve soil, eliminate smells, keep fruit from ripening and soothe cow stomachs. Keeping methane from the atmosphere could be its biggest job yet.
Methane is many times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, which is the byproduct of burning methane at power plants, on stoves or atop oil wells. A lot of methane wafts into the atmosphere at concentrations that are too low to burn. Besides coal mines and belching cattle, methane seeps from swamps, landfills, manure lagoons and melting permafrost. It bubbles up from lake bottoms and escapes pipelines and drilling sites.
Desiree Plata, an MIT professor leading the work, said that if emissions from the world's coal mines were filtered through copper zeolite, methane could stop accumulating in the atmosphere. If methane emissions were cut by 45% by 2030, projected warming would be reduced by a half-degree Celsius by 2100, according to climate experts.
A half degree is nothing to sniff at. TheUnited Nations' advisory body on climate change says the difference between average global temperatures rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and 2 degrees Celsius (a 0.9-degree Fahrenheit gap) equates to ecological mayhem. Species loss at twice the rate for plants and animals, triple for insects. Crop yields down 7% instead of 3%.

Full text: More young adults are looking to invest in ESG, but many don't know where to start and can't meet the investment minimum to work with a full-service financial adviser.
Money-management firms are adding options to attract these customers, for whom investing even small amounts with an environmental, social or governance focus -- while paying low fees -- is a priority.
While these relatively inexpensive platforms do offer lower investment minimums, ease of use and ESG products, some can lack the ability to target specific themes or causes that investors might be looking for. What's more, annual fees could still bite into your portfolio's value.
With those caveats in mind, here is a look at some robo advisers offering ESG investing with low minimum investments.
Ally Invest
Ally Invest, a subsidiary of Ally Financial Inc., uses a questionnaire to ask new customers what matters most to them. For those who indicate interest in investing in a socially responsible portfolio, the robo adviser then provides an investment recommendation that includes four ESG-focused exchange-traded funds based on MSCI ESG Focus indexes. Each of the funds tracks a different ESG-focused index. One focuses on large- and midcap companies, one on companies in developed countries, one on emerging markets and the otheronsmall-cap stocks.
Investment minimum: $100 initial investment to open the account
Fees: There are no advisory fees, annual charges or rebalancing fees for Ally's cash-enhanced portfolio, which maintains a 30% target allocation to cash within the account. For the robo's market-focused portfolios, where the target allocation to cash is 2%, there is an annual fee of 0.30% of assets under management.
Axos Invest Managed Portfolios
Axos Invest Managed Portfolios, owned by Axos Financial Inc., asks clients to choose a portfolio based on desired risk level (ranging from 100% equity to 100% fixed income). They can modify their portfolio to include ESG investments.
The range of ESG options includes an existing portfolio with four ESG-oriented ETFs that focus on ESG principles broadly, clean energy, gender diversity and water resources. Or, investors can choose to create their own portfolios and include any of those four same.
Investment minimum: $500
Fees: An annual advisory fee 0.24% of assets under management applies to invested assets, not free-standing cash.
Betterment
Customers of Betterment can choose one of three socially responsible investing strategies either when setting up an account or later if they want to add account goals. The three strategy choices are broad impact, climate impact and social impact.
The broad-impact portfolio is Betterment's general sustainable investing option, which gives investors exposure to the three ESG pillars -- environment, social and governance. The climate-impact portfolio focuses on areas of the economy working to mitigate climate change. The social-impact portfolio has a focus on social equity and minority empowerment. Governance issues are addressed in the broad-impact portfolio. Each portfolio includes an allocation to Engine No. 1 Transform 500 (VOTE), an ETF managed by investment firm Engine No. 1, which says its investment strategies follow ESG principles.
Investment minimum: None.
Fees: 0.25%of your invested balance annually
E*Trade
Core Portfolios, the robo for E*Trade, owned by Morgan Stanley, recommends a portfolio based on your answers to a risk assessment. Clients then can choose to customize the account with ETFs that emphasize companies with progressive environmental, social and governance practices.
There are five taxable portfolios available with a socially responsible focus.E*Trade also offers four ESG-focused portfolios that are tax-sensitive; they employ municipal-bond ETFs to mitigate taxes incurred on interest and dividends within the portfolios.
Investment minimum: $500
Fees: 0.3% of assets under management annually
M1
M1, owned by M1Holdings Inc., offers an option for automated, commission-free investing. Users can invest in off-the-shelf M1-designed portfolios of ETFs and stocks, referred to as "Pies," or create Pies of their own.
M1 offers six ESG Community Pies that focus on specific themes such as companies led by Black or female executives, or businesses that have committed to sustainable policies and practices. Users also can choose from two Expert ESG Pies, one consisting of five domestic ESG funds, and a second that adds two international ESG funds. Investors can create as many customized ESG Pies as they like.
Investment minimum: Investments totaling $100 are required to open a brokerage account and $500 for a traditional individual retirement account or Roth IRA.
Fees: There is no investment management fee
Wealthfront
Wealthfront's robo offers a Socially Responsible portfolio that consists of seven ETFs that track indexes for socially responsible companies. In addition, investors can start with Wealthfront's Classic or SRI (for socially responsible investing) portfolio and customize it by adding funds to support the causes they care most about, or removing funds that they don't want. They also can create a portfolio from scratch with ETFs focused on themes such as renewable energy, gender and racial equity, and animal welfare. There are hundreds of funds to choose from.
Investment minimum: $500 to open an account
Fees: 0.25% of assets under management annually

Full text: Venture capitalist John Doerr and his wife, Ann Doerr, are giving Stanford University $1.1 billion to launch a new school focused on tackling challenges of climate change and sustainability issues.
The Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability will launch this fall and be the university's first new school in 70 years.
The gift is the largest in the university's history, and appears to be the second largest one-time gift ever made to a university, behind Michael Bloomberg's $1.8 billion gift to his alma mater Johns Hopkins University, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education's list of donations.
Mr. Doerr, an engineer by profession and later a venture capitalist and chairman of Kleiner Perkins, made his fortune as one of the first institutional investors in Google and Amazon, among other successful business ventures, during the dot-com era.
"As parents, seeing what's going on in California -- we've got the fires -- seeing floods in the Midwest, we're seeing droughts in Africa, we just can't sit back," Ms. Doerr said Wednesday.
Mr. Doerr, who has long had a connection to Stanford, said he has been interested in the Palo Alto, Calif., university's work on sustainability and climate change.
Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne said the new school will include traditional academic departments such as natural sciences, engineering and social sciences, as well as building on their interdisciplinary institutes. "It will also have an "accelerator that we added to that structure to enable our faculty to go from idea to impact much more seamlessly, much more effectively, much more efficiently,"

Full text: Bill Gates said he isn't sure of Elon Musk's motives in buying Twitter Inc. and that social media must play a role in curbing the spread of misinformation.
"He actually could make it worse," Mr. Gates said of Mr. Musk's potential impact on the platform, speaking Wednesday at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit. But, he said, "That's not his track record."
"How does he feel about something that says vaccines kill people or that Bill Gates is tracking people?" Mr. Gates said, adding, "It's not totally clear what he is going to do."
In a recent tweet, Mr. Musk confirmed he confronted Mr. Gates about shorting Tesla Inc. In the tweets, Mr. Gates contacted his fellow billionaire to discuss philanthropy in climate change, but Mr. Musk asked if Mr. Gates still had a $500 million short position in Tesla. Mr. Gates responded that he hadn't closed it out, to which Mr. Musk said he couldn't take Mr. Gates's philanthropy seriously if he was shorting the electric-car maker.
Mr. Gates didn't directly answer a question about whether he personally shorted Tesla, saying climate change was a focus of the Gates Foundation.
"I don't think whether one's short or long Tesla is a statement about your seriousness about climate change," Mr. Gates said. "I applaud Tesla's role in helping with climate change."
He added, "I have nothing but positive things to say about Elon. If he makes Twitter worse, fine, I'll speak out about that, but I wouldn't assume that's what's going to happen."
Mr. Musk, who supplanted Mr. Gates as the world's richest person, agreed to pay $44 billion to buy Twitter, saying he wants to ensure it protects free speech.
Mr. Gates said he was often the subject of misinformation during the pandemic and not all misinformation stems from social media, such as the popularity of taking hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19. "The fact that people latched on politically to particular drugs that truly did not work. Who would have expected that?" he said. "It is pretty hard to explain."
The Microsoft Corp. co-founder and global philanthropist said political leaders had a role to play in combating misinformation. "When you do not have the trusted leaders speaking out about vaccines, it's pretty hard for the platform to work against that," he said. "We have a leadership problem, and we have a platform problem."
"The way that you make those platforms spread truth and not crazy stuff, there's some real invention required there, and it's partly in the political realm," Mr. Gates said. "I don't have the solution to that. I hope lots of brilliant people are thinking about it, but it is a huge problem in terms of legitimacy of the elections or medical innovations."
In a recent Journal essay, Mr. Gates argued the world needs a full-time, paid team whose job it is to prevent pandemics, dubbing the proposed effort "GERM." The Gates Foundation committed more than $2 billion to pandemic relief.
On Wednesday, Mr. Gates said the effort would include a social-media team that puts out messages with information about issues such as vaccines. But he said trusted leaders in communities need to be engaged to stop the spread of misinformation. "We went to the religious leaders. They vaccinated their children," he said, speaking of the foundation's efforts to eradicate polio in Africa. "We eradicated wild polio from Nigeria, but it took us three years."
He said a lack of cooperation among countries during the pandemic hurt global efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus cases and that tensions with Russia and China could hurt future efforts. "The United States during a global pandemic literally withdrew from the World Health Organization," he said. "That left everyone going, 'What are we supposed to do?'"
Last year, Mr. Gates and Melinda French Gates said they were ending their marriage after 27 years. Following the announcement, the couple said they would remain co-chairs and trustees of the Gates Foundation and would work jointly to shape and approve its overall direction.
At the CEO Council Summit on Wednesday, Mr. Gates said his work at the foundation isn't a source of tension in his relationship with Ms. French Gates. "This last year, our marriage ended," he said. "It never interfered with our working together."

Full text: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. posted its best earnings in its history last quarter. Its stock is trouncing the S&P 500. And Warren Buffett's star power seems to be as strong as ever.
More than 40,000 people are expected to descend on Omaha, Neb., this weekend for Berkshire's first in-person shareholder meeting since 2019. They will be traveling hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of miles just to have a chance to hear from the famed "Oracle of Omaha," who turned 91 in August.
But even as Berkshire thrives, it is contending with an unusual number of big challenges.
The nation's largest public pension fund, California Public Employees' Retirement System, plans to back a shareholder proposal that would oust Mr. Buffett, who is both chief executive and chairman of Berkshire, from his chairman role. The proposal's backers argue that companies are better off when different individuals fill the two roles. Asset manager Neuberger Berman is supporting another proposal that demands Berkshire disclose data on climate-related risks across its businesses. Three giant institutional shareholders, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group and State Street Corp., backed a similar measure last year.
Mr. Buffett also faces other questions: what to do with an enormous pile of cash amassed over the last decade, how the company will operate when he is no longer at the helm and whether he is doing enough to adapt to a changing investment world where funds are pouring into new types of assets such as cryptocurrencies. All these pressures are building at a difficult time, as central banks dial back their support for the economy and markets get more volatile.
Mr. Buffett didn't comment on any of these questions ahead of Saturday's meeting. At past gatherings, he said Berkshire had a proper succession plan in place and that he had every bit of confidence in his lieutenants. Mr. Buffett said to shareholders in his latest annual letter that he had struggled to find companies that met his criteria for long-term ownership.
During the pandemic, he kept traveling to a minimum. He told ex-CBS News anchor Charlie Rose in an interview in April that he took two plane flights in two years, once to see his sister. He said is still happy in his job even though he can't read or crunch numbers as fast as he did in his younger years.
He also suggested he is in no hurry to leave. "I'm still in overtime, but I'm still out there," he said.
The proposals up for vote Saturday face long odds. Mr. Buffett has a 32% voting stake in the company, as well as a legion of fiercely loyal individual shareholders behind him. That has allowed Berkshire, which is recommending that investors vote against the proposals, to strike down similar measures in past years.
The National Legal and Policy Center -- which filed proposals calling for board independence not just at Berkshire but also at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Mondelez International Inc. and Salesforce.com Inc. -- argues that a corporation's governance structure is stronger when the two roles are held by different individuals.
It has support from a retirement system, known by its acronym Calpers, that oversees more than $450 billion in investments for more than two million current or retired public employees across California. Calpers said it generally supports a separate chair and chief executive at all of the companies where it owns stock because corporate governance is more effective that way.
"Our position is not a reflection on Mr. Buffett's acumen as an investor," said Simiso Nzima, managing investment director of global equity at Calpers, in emailed comments.
Berkshire's board said in its response to the proposal that it agrees the two roles should be split -- just not while Mr. Buffett is chief executive. Once Mr. Buffett steps aside, the board intends on naming a nonmanagement director to be its chair. Mr. Buffett has said his son, Howard, will succeed him as chairman.
Companies have increasingly moved toward making their boards more independent, making Berkshire an outlier -- though by no means the only one. Last year, 59% of the companies in the S&P 500 had a separate chair and chief executive, according to Spencer Stuart, an executive and board recruiting firm. That is up from 55% in 2021 and 41% in 2011.
Academic research on the matter has been mixed. One study from Indiana University's Kelley School of Business, for instance, found splitting the roles helped companies if they were struggling but actually hurt them if they were already doing well.
Mr. Buffett's longtime followers have seen variations of this fight play out before. They are familiar with complaints that Berkshire -- whose head office counts roughly two dozen employees and has no formal press or investor relations employees -- is too opaque. Mr. Buffett doesn't hold meetings with institutional investors to try to curry favor with them. Nor does he set aside special time with sell-side analysts covering the company.
But investors say their faith in Mr. Buffett runs so deep that they couldn't care less about all that.
The first stock Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, bought when he founded his firm in 2000 was Berkshire. This weekend will mark what he estimates is his 32nd or 33rd Berkshire shareholder meeting. (It is hard to keep count.) When he spoke to The Wall Street Journal from his office, he sat facing bobbleheads of Mr. Buffett and right-hand man Charlie Munger and in front of a portrait of the two men together.
"I think they're smoking too much cannabis out there," he said in jest about Calpers, the pension fund pushing for an independent board chair.
To Berkshire's longtime investors, Mr. Buffett's track record speaks for itself. Between 1965 and 2000, Berkshire produced 20% compounded annualized gains. The S&P 500 returned 10.2% including dividends over the period.
That is why, Mr. Lountzis said, Berkshire remains his firm's biggest equity holding -- and why he thinks that, even at 91 years old, Mr. Buffett is completely capable of continuing to wear both hats.
"What Warren has done so well over so many years is create shareholder value. And that's ultimately the most important thing," said Ryan Kelley, chief investment officer of Hennessy Funds, which holds Berkshire shares in its large-cap financial fund.
A more pressing issue for Berkshire? What to do with its enormous pile of cash.
Berkshire had a near-record $144 billion of cash and equivalents at the end of last year, excluding what it held at its freight railroad and utilities businesses. That is far more than Mr. Buffett and his investors would prefer. In fact, Mr. Buffett wrote to shareholders in February, he'd prefer to keep 100% of his net worth in equities.
The problem? He was struggling to find anything he felt was worth buying and holding for the long run.
"These periods are never pleasant," Mr. Buffett said in his February letter.
Since that letter, Berkshire has put some cash to work. In March, it reached an agreement with Alleghany Corp. to acquire the insurer for $11.6 billion. In April, Berkshire unveiled it had built a roughly $4.2 billion stake in HP Inc.
Investors are itching to see Mr. Buffett make some big moves. "Are there still places Warren can find value? I'm curious to hear his thoughts," Mr. Kelley said.
Another pressure point for Berkshire is how it is handling climate change. Two separate shareholder proposals ask Berkshire to disclose how it manages climate-related risks across all of its businesses, as well as to share whether it will begin measuring and publishing the greenhouse-gas emissions associated with its insurance operations.
It is far from the only company that activist investors are targeting. Investor advocacy groups say climate change is the No. 1 issue among the record number of shareholder proposals that have been filed so far this year.
Berkshire's board said in its response to the shareholder proposal that the vast majority of its greenhouse-gas emissions are generated by two businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and freight railroad BNSF. It sees no need to disclose information about all of its units, which include businesses as varied as jewelry retailer Borsheims, clothing manufacturer Fruit of the Loom, paint manufacturer Benjamin Moore & Co. and See's Candies.
Both Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF have publicly committed to reducing their carbon footprint over the coming years. The former is aiming to achieve net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050; the latter is aiming to cut emissions by 30% by 2030 from 2018 levels.
Neuberger, a big asset-management firm based in New York, said in a statement explaining its support for a proposal that the company could improve its disclosures "given the importance of the topic."
Ultimately, Mr. Buffett might not have a choice. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission formally proposed requiring publicly traded companies to report the greenhouse-gas emissions generated by their businesses, as well as from the energy they consume. Regulators haven't made the rule final.
If Berkshire seems stuck in its ways, that is likely partially a reflection of Mr. Buffett's approach to investing. It is slow. It is deliberate. And it hasn't really changed over the decades.
Some of his critics take issue with his reluctance to venture into newer, highly volatile investments. Billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel said at a bitcoin conference in April that Mr. Buffett is part of a "finance gerontocracy" keeping cryptocurrency prices from taking off further, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Larry Fink.
Yet as markets have swooned this year, Mr. Buffett's value approach is back in fashion as money managers seek areas of the markets that can ride out a more volatile environment. Whether that type of outperformance can continue when Mr. Buffett is no longer at Berkshire's helm is up in the air.
Berkshire has a succession plan in place. Mr. Buffett has tapped Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 59, who manages all of Berkshire's noninsurance operations, to ultimately succeed him as chief executive.
Meanwhile, portfolio managers Todd Combs, 51, and Ted Weschler, 59, are expected to run the company's massive investment portfolio by themselves once Mr. Buffett departs the job. Although Mr. Buffett still controls much of the portfolio himself, Mr. Combs and Mr. Weschler had "total authority" over $34 billion of investments as of the end of 2021, Mr. Buffett wrote in his February letter.
"They're setting themselves up for a good transition," Mr. Kelley said. Combined with the fact that Berkshire largely leaves its subsidiaries to manage their day-to-day operations, the company will likely continue to be a well-run collection of businesses even when Mr. Buffett is no longer around, he said.
What's less easy for investors to figure out is how much of Berkshire's cachet disappears when Mr. Buffett, a bona fide household name, is replaced by men far fewer people know.
That is a question likely to be left unanswered at this weekend's shareholder meeting.
"There's nobody else like him. Period," Mr. Lountzis said.

Full text: As Russia moves to cut off natural-gas supplies to parts of Europe, U.S. and European Union officials are indicating that they are more open to longer-term deals to ship American fuel across the Atlantic.
The EU and U.S. have pledged to expand LNG, or liquefied natural gas, exports to Europe through 2030. But the U.S. is already sending all it can to Europe, and industry officials say expanding volumes will require new, multibillion-dollar export terminals, which traditionally have required long-term contracts from buyers to line up financing.
European and U.S. officials have previously expressed opposition to such long-term contracts, which could lock in fossil-fuel supplies for decades, conflicting with another policy goal: reducing the greenhouse-gas emissions linked to climate change. But in recent weeks EU and White House officials have told industry executives that they do support long-term supply contracts, according to people briefed on the meetings, marking a shift.
Melanie Nakagawa, special assistant to the president and senior director for climate and energy at the National Security Council, gave a public endorsement of long-term contracts Tuesday.
"There's a real potential here for Europe to signal the demand for U.S. LNG and for our U.S. LNG providers to provide that gas to them in the form of long-term contracts," she said at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
At a congressional hearing Thursday, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm rebutted criticism that the Biden administration hadn't done enough to support LNG exports.
"We have permitted almost three times as much as we currently are exporting, and they just haven't begun construction yet," she said. "This is not a President Biden issue."
"The political commitment is there to invest in this relationship," a European Commission spokesman for energy and climate issues said separately Thursday.
Charif Souki, co-founder of fledgling LNG exporter Tellurian Inc., said that while there are no short-term silver bullets for European energy, the focus should be on ensuring gas supplies for later in the decade.
"The best time to start an LNG facility would have been five years ago," Mr. Souki said. "The next best time is today."
Tellurian said it began construction on its $12 billion Driftwood LNG plant in Louisiana last month, despite not completing plans for financing the project. Mr. Souki said the decision stemmed in part from increased support from U.S. officials, whom he said had expedited regulatory approvals and other processes.
Still, Mr. Souki said he wished U.S. officials would clarify their long-term stance on the role of natural gas in the energy mix, a position he called schizophrenic because of mixed messages from the Biden administration.
No matter what happens, it is impossible in the short term for LNG shipments to fully replace Russian natural-gas exports to Europe, which have made up around 40% of the continent's supply in recent years.
The EU laid out aggressive plans to cut imports of Russian gas after the invasion of Ukraine, saying the bloc would secure an additional 50 billion cubic meters a year of LNG between 2022 and 2030 on top of the roughly 108 bcm Europe imported last year.
To do that, Europe would need to secure nearly all of the remaining new volumes coming online not expected to go to China, about 17 bcm, and procure the additional 33 bcm from shipments now going to other markets, according Nikos Tsafos, chairman of energy and geopolitics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. CSIS estimates that the earliest LNG plants not currently under construction could send new supplies to Europe is around 2026.
"There is not a trivial chance that we will have real physical shortages," said Mr. Tsafos. "The market can't re-allocate scarce supply."
Global supplies of LNG are expected to grow substantially over the next few years, driven by already planned build-outs in the U.S., Qatar, Australia and other countries. But global demand is set to grow rapidly alongside that, especially in China, which could itself consume about half the forecast additional volumes of LNG, analysts say.
Some buyers and sellers of LNG in the West have held off on building additional costly import and export infrastructure over what they say have been mixed signals from government officials in Europe and the U.S. on policy makers' long-term support for natural gas.
Countries have sought to curtail fossil-fuel emissions to meet the goals of the international Paris agreement, which aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees C, and preferably to 1.5 degrees C, from preindustrial levels. Some exporters have had trouble getting buyers to sign long-term LNG contracts, which typically run around 20 years.
The most pressing LNG problem facing Europe is that it lacks the import infrastructure to receive more of the fuel.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Democrats began a last-ditch effort to cobble together a narrower version of President Biden's once-sweeping economic agenda that could win the critical support of Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and hand the party a legislative victory ahead of the fall elections.
Mr. Manchin met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Tuesday to discuss the possibility of a party-line package focused on raising taxes and reducing the budget deficit, and he convened a group of lawmakers from both parties on Monday to discuss ways to bolster energy production, another priority for Mr. Manchin.
Democrats see the coming weeks as a critical window to attempt to rescue their waylaid ambitions in the 50-50 Senate, where the party must rely on Mr. Manchin's vote to achieve policy goals broadly opposed by Republicans.
Mr. Manchin last year rejected a House-passed package for roughly $2 trillion in spending on healthcare, climate and child-care programs, dooming the plan dubbed Build Back Better. Democrats have since tiptoed around prized policy goals in hopes of eventually settling on a compromise with the West Virginian.
With the midterm elections months away, many Democrats are eager to try to kick-start talks before campaign-season politics further complicate the effort -- and before they possibly lose their thin control of the Senate and House.
"I think it's a make-or-break moment for the elements of Build Back Better that are still on the table," said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.). "The clock is ticking. This is a perishable moment."
Mr. Manchin has said he would support legislation focused on raising taxes, cutting the deficit, producing more energy in the U.S. and reducing the cost of prescription drugs. He has rejected various proposals to expand the social safety net, including creating a national paid-leave program and offering a more-generous child tax credit.
While Democrats appear to have accepted that many of their original policy goals for the bill won't pass this Congress, they have given priority to measures to fight climate change in the revamped effort. Mr. Manchin has in recent weeks sought to incorporate measures facilitating fossil-fuel production as well.
The meeting of Republicans and Democrats on Monday about energy policy was an early, broad discussion, according to lawmakers and aides.
"I'm working with a group trying to find a bipartisan way that we can move forward on energy, and we'll just have to see where we get," Mr. Manchin said.
Forging an agreement on energy policy that can win broad support from Democrats, who prioritize aid for clean energy sources such as wind and solar power, and Republicans, who want to support fossil fuels, will be challenging. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.), who attended the meeting, said Republicans would oppose any plan that resembles Democrats' previous plans for reducing carbon emissions.
"That leaves maybe a fairly narrow band depending on what price people are willing to pay," Mr. Cramer said.
Mr. Manchin's overture to Republicans, meanwhile, puzzled some Democrats, with some skeptical the talks would produce anything they could support.
"I mean it's way too early to see what they're going to include and what's going to be involved. I'm going to vote for the strongest possible climate provisions. I'm skeptical that a bipartisan solution is going to yield the results when it hasn't so far," said Sen. Tina Smith (D., Minn.).
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration wouldn't prejudge Mr. Manchin's pursuit of a bipartisan energy plan. She said the White House would "continue to engage with a broad range of Democrats, including, of course, Sen. Manchin, about how to get the president's agenda done."
Mr. Manchin said Democrats should pursue tax increases along party lines through a process called reconciliation, which allows lawmakers to skirt the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate. Republicans have opposed Democrats' plans for raising taxes, which would reverse or change elements of the 2017 tax law the GOP ushered through Congress along party lines and implement crucial pieces of the global minimum corporate tax agreement that is a priority for the Biden administration.
"We talked about inflation, [Mr. Schumer] wants to do something, and basically whatever's done with the tax code, using that toward fighting inflation," said Mr. Manchin.

Full text: CAN TECHNOLOGY save the day? And if so, which technology?
Climate experts on a United Nations panel recently expressed concern about the state of climate science, saying the past decade saw the highest average yearly greenhouse-gas emissions from human activities ever recorded. Countries, they said, must make major, rapid shifts away from fossil fuels if they have any hope of meeting goals laid out in the 2015 Paris Climate Accords.
The Wall Street Journal recently asked energy academics and researchers which specific climate-technology breakthroughs they think have the potential to be most transformative. Some talked about technologies on the horizon; others focused on existing technologies that could be deployed to help get the world to zero emissions by 2050.
Here is what they said about the technologies that they believe have the most promise:
The Heat Under Our Feet
-- Joan Fitzgerald is a professor in the School of Public Policy and Public Affairs at Northeastern University and the author of "Greenovation: Urban Leadership on Climate Change."
When it comes to renewables, most people think of wind and solar. But there is another renewable-energy technology used for heating and cooling that doesn't always get the appreciation it deserves: ground-source heat pumps.
These systems, which draw heat out of the ground to heat buildings in winter and pump heat from buildings back into the ground to cool them in summer, are four to five times more efficient than fossil-fuel systems, and the energy isn't intermittent like it is with wind and solar. Geothermal heat pumps can be configured into networks that connect buildings on a street, moving energy on demand or storing it when it isn't needed.
Networked heat pumps aren't new -- they already are used on numerous college campuses -- but recent breakthroughs could be transformative if the right policies are put in place.
In Massachusetts, HEET, a nonprofit seeking to reduce fossil-fuel emissions, is working with two of the state's largest natural-gas utilities to install and test networked heat pumps in neighborhoods, in the hopes of scaling the technology. A three-year Eversource project will connect about 100 homes and businesses, starting this summer. Four National Grid pilots announced in February will explore implementation in different types of neighborhoods. Changing the regulatory structure to allow gas utilities to sell thermal energy is now on the agenda at the Massachusetts Legislature.
A Massachusetts feasibility study estimates that converting neighborhoods from natural gas to networked heat pumps could reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from heating, cooling and domestic hot water in those areas by more than 90% by 2050. To achieve this dramatic result, policy and planning breakthroughs will be key.
A Better Air Conditioner
-- Caroline Winslow and Radhika Lalit are managers at RMI (formerly Rocky Mountain Institute), an independent nonprofit focused on decarbonizing the global energy system.
Most people think of residential room air conditioners as just another household appliance. In reality, the increased adoption of space cooling, especially in the developing world, represents one of the single largest end-use risks to our global climate goals.
There is a solution, however. New, highly efficient AC units under development could become powerful tools for both mitigating and adapting to a warming climate, all while giving people access to a better quality of life.
In 2018, a competition to find climate-friendly cooling technologies that could be commercialized and brought to market in the next few years was initiated by our company, RMI, and another nonprofit, Mission Innovation, along with the Indian government. The winning prototypes -- from Japanese manufacturer Daikin Industries and partner, Nikken Sekkei Ltd., and Chinese manufacturer Gree Electric Appliances Inc. and partner, Tsinghua University -- combined hybrid vapor compression systems with more climate-friendly refrigerants to create highly efficient room ACs with an 80% lower climate impact than a typical model on the market today. The higher incremental cost of such super-efficient units would have a payback period of less than three years due to energy savings, RMI estimated.
The Big Three
-- Gregory Nemet is a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's La Follette School of Public Affairs whose research focuses on the process of technological change in energy and its interactions with public policy.
To get the world economy to zero emissions by midcentury, we need to move light and fast. That means aggressively expanding what we know works and is affordable -- wind, solar and electric vehicles -- on the order of how quickly we built ships and airplanes in World War II. Falling prices, digitization of the economy and more flexible electric grids can enable us to do that.
The "big three" have improved dramatically over the past 10 years -- solar and batteries for electric vehicles are 90% cheaper, while wind power is 50% cheaper. Although wind and solar aren't available at all times, an emerging combination of technologies is enabling reliable power systems with high amounts of variable renewables. These systems include batteries and other energy storage; new transmission; combining diverse renewables; programs to reduce energy use during peak periods; improved forecasting; and some limited backup, such as nuclear and natural gas with carbon capture. This increasingly clean electric grid, combined with the steadily falling cost and growing adoption of EVs, also is on its way to becoming the core of a clean transportation sector.
Digitization of the economy is helping to fuel this transformation by, among other things, making the electric grid smart and offering ways to substantially reduce material and energy consumption, for example through shared mobility.
A Leap for Nuclear
-- Seaver Wang is co-director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Breakthrough Institute, a global research center that promotes technological solutions to environmental and human-development challenges.
The first reactor unit at the Shidao Bay next-generation nuclear power plant in eastern China went live in December. The milestone was met with little fanfare, but future generations may see it as a landmark leap for clean energy.
The small, innovative 200-megawatt reactor is exciting because in addition to clean electricity, it produces high-temperature heat that could be used to help decarbonize energy-intensive industries that lack ready clean-energy alternatives.
Most conventional reactors today produce outlet steam at temperatures of up to 300 degrees Celsius, which can power industrial processes such as seawater desalination and hydrogen electrolysis, in which water is split into hydrogen and oxygen. The Shidao Bay reactor -- which uses spherical fuel pebbles coated in graphite as an energy source and pressurized helium as a coolant -- generates steam at outlet temperatures of about 560 degrees Celsius, which potentially could power even more processes, such as plastics production and more-efficient hydrogen production via high-temperature water splitting. Such technology could even facilitate replacement of coal-fired generating units with nuclear reactors, enabling more extensive re-use of existing power-plant steam infrastructure.
Given China's coal-heavy power grid, the successful deployment of this reactor offers hope that advanced nuclear could make a big difference for the climate in the world's highest-emitting country and beyond. The reactor is smaller, potentially making it easier to build and more adaptable to varying energy needs, and sets a new standard in improved safety, thanks in part to its simplicity of design and highly heat-resistant fuel. Finally, China's notable recent successes in building nuclear projects overseas means the technology might spread world-wide faster than many expect.
Cleansing the Air
-- Michael E. Webber is a professor of energy resources at the University of Texas and the chief technology officer at the venture fund Energy Impact Partners.
Technologies that remove carbon-dioxide from the atmosphere are helpful if we want to get to net-zero emissions, and critical if we want to drive down CO2 levels to where they were before the Industrial Revolution.
There are several approaches to carbon removal, such as planting more trees, sequestering carbon in soils and directly capturing CO2 from the atmosphere with machines. This last option, known as direct air capture (or DAC), is particularly powerful because the technology is modular, which means we can make many copies of the same design, and it can be deployed anywhere.
Unlike other pollutants, what matters with carbon dioxide isn't the location of its release but the total atmospheric accumulation. Releasing greenhouse gases in industrial corridors and then removing them from the atmosphere in remote locations has essentially the same net effect as if the carbon wasn't emitted in the first place. That means we can deploy DAC systems wherever the energy for their operation is cheapest, ecosystem impacts are lowest, and the economic activity would be welcome.
The modularity of DAC systems implies that costs for CO2 removal might drop 90% to 95% over a couple of decades, just like the recent cost declines for other modular solutions such as wind turbines, solar panels and lithium-ion batteries.
This isn't a fantasy: In September 2021, Iceland started deploying geothermal energy to power a DAC system that removes CO2 and permanently sequesters it below ground. Now that we know it works, it is a matter of scaling up.
Solar Microgrids
-- Alexandra von Meier is an adjunct professor in the department of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. She also directs the Electric Grid Research program at the California Institute for Energy and Environment and the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (Citris).
Climate technologies are more likely to go viral if they also address pain points energy consumers face today. Solar microgrids, helped by information technology, have the potential to be such a solution, able to accomplish climate mitigation and adaptation at the same time.
What do people really want when it comes to energy? Security. That means health and safety, comfort, and knowing that your essential needs will be covered even during a crisis, such as a power outage associated with an extreme weather event or wildfire.
A solar microgrid, which generates, stores and distributes clean energy to homes and facilities in a local network, provides a strong answer to these needs and wants. It can integrate with the main electric grid or disconnect and operate autonomously if the main grid is stressed or goes down. The physical pieces -- solar panels, batteries and inverters -- have been improving for a while. What's new and coming, though, is the ability to orchestrate these different pieces into agile electric grids.
With digital tools and data science, demand for energy can now be sculpted locally to match available resources, reducing the number of power plants that utilities need to keep in reserve. The key is giving consumers the ability to separate flexible energy uses -- say, operating a Jacuzzi -- from essential needs, which can now be done with phone apps for smart appliances and service panels.
Meanwhile, connections between groups of customers can be opened and closed as needed with modern, communicating circuit switchgear. On most days, solar microgrids will stay connected to the main grid, importing or exporting power as needed to help balance the load. During emergencies, though, they can operate safely as power islands of different sizes to sustain vital services.
Such adaptability will unlock the priceless benefits of local security, while continuing to allow access to inexpensive bulk energy through the macro-grid. In this way, solar microgrids can become a flexible and affordable solution to our climate challenges.
Enhanced Energy Storage
-- Amy Myers Jaffe is a research professor and managing director of the Climate Policy Lab at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.
Batteries are a critical technology for expanding renewable-energy use, collecting solar and wind power at times of low demand so it can be redeployed later when more electricity is needed.
The good news is that record amounts of batteries are being installed in U.S. homes and on the electric grid, despite supply-chain bottlenecks. The bad news is that current battery technology only offers a few hours of storage. What's needed are more-powerful battery systems that can extend the length or scale of storing, which could be even more enabling to sun and wind power.
Two such solutions are on the horizon. Stationary metal-air batteries, such as iron-air batteries, don't hold as much energy per kilogram as lithium-ion batteries so it takes a larger, heavier battery to do the job. But they are cheaper, iron is a plentiful metal, and the batteries, whose chemistry works via interaction of the metal with air, can be sized and installed to store and discharge a large level of electricity over days or weeks. While not an option for cars due to heavy weight and size, improved large iron-air batteries are poised to become a great new backup for renewable energy within the next couple of years to address those times of year when drops in renewable energy production can last for days and not hours.
For households, a battery configuration called a virtual power plant also holds huge potential to extend the use of renewables. These systems allow a local utility or electricity distributor to collect excess energy stored in multiple households' battery systems and feed it back to the grid when there is a surge in demand or generation shortfall.
Greener Shipping
-- Ingrid Irigoyen is the director and Taylor Goelz the program manager of the Aspen Institute Shipping Decarbonization Initiative.
Maritime shipping is considered challenging to decarbonize because of the industry's global, distributed nature and a lack of ready clean-energy alternatives. But thanks to promising emerging technologies, as well as growing public pressure and regulatory interest, investment in zero-emissions shipping is starting to heat up.
Electrification is a good choice for smaller vessels on short voyages, like the world's largest all-electric ferry launched in Norway in 2021. It isn't yet a viable option for ships on transoceanic voyages because batteries are still too large and heavy, though innovative approaches for battery swapping are being explored.
For longer voyages, e-ammonia, a hydrogen-derived fuel made with renewable energy, has been identified as a prime candidate, although work is needed to ensure safety. Ammonia has a higher energy density than some other options, making it a more economical option for powering large ships across oceans. It also has potential for lower life-cycle emissions if renewable energy is used as an energy source.
Others in the industry are investing in green fuels that may be ready for deployment sooner, such as e-methanol, which can be made by combining renewable-energy-generated hydrogen with carbon from direct air capture or biogenic sources. Most studies, however, predict e-ammonia outcompeting e-methanol on cost in the long term.
Policy support, cross-sector collaboration and private investment will be needed to deploy and rapidly scale these solutions, but the payoff could be significant. Maritime shipping currently emits approximately 1 billion tons of greenhouse gases a year, equivalent to the emissions from all U.S. coal-fired power plants combined. Without intervention, shipping's emissions footprint could triple by 2050, threatening achievement of Paris Agreement goals.
Innovation in EV Batteries
-- John Paul MacDuffie is a professor of management and director of the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation at the Mack Institute for Innovation Management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
Shortages of battery materials are widely seen as a brake on electric vehicles' growth. But alternative battery chemistries that minimize or avoid the most problematic raw materials could circumvent these constraints within the next few years.
Most EV makers chose a nickel-manganese-cobalt combination for their lithium-ion batteries because it delivers the most power density, and hence longer range, for the buck. But it also relies on two problematic minerals -- nickel, for which supplies are limited, and cobalt, which is both scarce and plagued by unsafe mining and exploitation of child labor. NMC batteries also can burst into flames under certain conditions.
Some EV makers such as Tesla are now embracing an older, less-expensive battery technology known as lithium-iron-phosphate, or LFP, used originally in scooters and small EVs in China. It draws entirely on cheap and abundant minerals and is less flammable. The power density of LFP is less than NMC, but that disadvantage can be overcome by advances in vehicle design.
One approach being tested eliminates the outer packaging of the batteries altogether and directly installs cells, packed in layers, into a cavity in the EV's body chassis. This design saves weight and boosts power density and, coupled with software tweaks, could help alternative battery chemistries like LFP deliver a longer-range charge.
Eventually, solid-state batteries -- with a solid electrolyte made from common minerals like glass or ceramics -- could become a key EV battery technology. (So far, they can be found only in pacemakers and smartwatches.) The solid electrolyte is more chemically stable, lighter, recharges faster and has many more lifetime recharging cycles than lithium-ion batteries, which depend on heavy liquid electrolytes.
Overall, these innovations are good news for those hoping to speed up EV adoption. They also suggest that batteries, far from becoming a standardized commodity, are going to be customized as auto makers create their own vehicle designs and battery makers develop proprietary platforms.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Voter unrest over high energy prices and concern over dependence on Russian energy have given Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) leverage to press for measures promoting more domestic fossil-fuel production in the Democrats' new climate legislation and potential executive actions.
Mr. Manchin's interests include getting financial and permitting help for natural-gas exports and oil and gas pipelines, as well as policies to make it easier for companies to drill more on federal territory, according to lobbyists and congressional aides familiar with the situation.
More Democrats, including President Biden, have tried to push the country away from fossil fuels in recent years to address climate change. But in a closely divided Senate, Democrats need Mr. Manchin's support for clean-energy initiatives they hope to revive. They were included in Mr. Biden's Build Back Better bill, which Mr. Manchin helped torpedo last year.
Polls showing voters are unhappy with inflation fed by high energy prices have put added pressure on Democrats. With expectations high that Republicans might be able to retake House or Senate majorities in this year's midterm elections, some Democrats might be open to a compromise benefiting the traditional energy industry to pass a climate bill while they still can.
"Basically this is going to be the Manchin bill," said Edward Hild, a former chief of staff to Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) who is now a lobbyist with the law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney. "Everybody knows."
Several moves for which Mr. Manchin has voiced support would likely need to come through the executive branch -- not legislation -- meaning Mr. Biden would need to sign orders and take actions on his own concurrently with the passage of a spending bill as part of any deal. Lobbyists and aides who have spoken to Mr. Manchin and his staff said they have yet to outline which measures he must have to vote for an energy and climate bill.
The package being discussed would reshape climate-related elements of the failed Build Back Better legislation to include more measures aimed at helping Western nations wean themselves off energy supplied by Russia and other authoritarian regimes, the people familiar with the situation said.
Supporters in Congress, including Mr. Manchin, have said such steps would strengthen energy security for the U.S. and its allies. They would help Western countries with short-term measures aimed at increasing supplies of natural gas, gasoline and other fossil fuels, as well as long-range strategies to develop cleaner alternatives.
Pairing domestic fossil-fuel development with clean energy helps Congress address climate change and the energy vulnerabilities exposed by Russia's Ukraine war, said Joseph Majkut, director of the energy-security and climate-change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "If this crisis worsens, energy security, economies and human welfare are all at risk," Mr. Majkut said.
Aides to Mr. Manchin have explored legislation for federal funds to help European allies build new terminals to accept more U.S.-produced natural gas, one of the people said.
Another move his team has considered would give the energy secretary authority to fast-track the equivalent of free-trade status for North Atlantic Treaty Organization members and other U.S. allies who want to buy U.S. natural gas but don't have free-trade agreements, this person said.
Some of Mr. Manchin's efforts are expected to face opposition from some Democrats who say the Biden administration has already retreated too far from its goal of weaning the U.S. off fossil fuels.
Asked for comment, the White House responded with recent statements, including comments from principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying the administration is seeking to increase short-term supplies of gasoline while pressing forward with the transition to clean energy.
"Addressing the emergency supply crunch while accelerating clean energy efforts is fully consistent with the theory of the case and what we're trying to do," she said.
Climate activists are expecting to compromise, said Justin Guay, director for global climate strategy at the Sunrise Project. But they will likely draw the line at gas-export terminals and other big infrastructure that could encourage years of additional fossil-fuel consumption. "A climate bill can't be a cover for cynical opportunism and handouts for fossil fuels," he said.
Democrats could strike a deal that fulfills some of Mr. Manchin's demands, even help for pipelines, and still make the progress they need if the clean-energy provisions are strong enough, Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, says.
"One pipeline is not going to make or break whether we solve climate change," said John Larsen, who leads the firm's U.S. energy-system and climate-policy research. "The clean-energy investments should be a much bigger deal, a much bigger benefit than any small cost on the supply side."

Pipeline Projects
Are a Key Focus
In his public-speaking engagements in recent weeks, Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) has said the White House should support stalled pipeline projects to take natural gas out of West Virginia and oil out of Canada, including the Keystone XL pipeline project, for which Mr. Biden revoked a key permit last year.
Mr. Manchin has said publicly that one of his top requests is for the White House to use its wartime powers to overcome permitting and legal troubles that have prevented the completion of a key pipeline out of his home state.
Mr. Manchin wants Mr. Biden to use the Defense Production Act to force through the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, planned to transport natural gas from shale formations in northwestern West Virginia to southern Virginia.
"There's so much that we can be doing right now. We can't get a 42-inch pipeline out of the Marcellus Shale. It's ridiculous," Mr. Manchin said at a recent industry event. "So I talk to the White House, [which says,] 'What can we do to help you?' I said, 'Build the damn line.'"

Full text: COUNTRIES around the world are introducing rules requiring companies to disclose information about their impact on society and the environment.
This can involve anything from tracking greenhouse-gas emissions and plastic waste to reporting on diversity and social inclusion. As other governments add or firm up their rules, the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed regulations requiring public companies to disclose extensive climate-related information.
Wall Street Journal reporter Fabiana Negrin Ochoa spoke with Vanessa Havard-Williams, partner and global head of environment and climate change for advisory firm Linklaters, and Satyam Khanna, former senior policy adviser for climate and ESG at the SEC, at the WSJ Pro Sustainable Business Forum. Here are edited excerpts of the discussion.
WSJ: What will these proposed rules change?
MR. KHANNA: Today a lot of companies are reporting under a number of voluntary frameworks, an "alphabet soup." In the U.S., those largely occur outside of formal securities filings and voluntary reporting. The SEC has proposed a rule to move that voluntary reporting into a formal process in the securities filings in your annual reports. It formalizes this process that otherwise was largely informal and subjects it to the suite of internal controls, governance, etc., that companies are familiar with in their quarterly and annual reporting to the SEC. So, the SEC is providing a structure, a baseline, a foundation, for environmental, social and governance reporting in the U.S.
WSJ: Give us a quick tour of regulation in the European Union, which, arguably, is much further down the road than the U.S.
MS. HAVARD-WILLIAMS: In the EU, we've got a number of different regulations. We've got the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, which introduced some initial requirements for asset managers on disclosing ESG information about their investments, among other things.
That has an indirect impact on entities that managers invest in, because the asset managers need to get the information from those entities.
Then we've also got the taxonomy, which is the EU's supergreen classification system for economic activities that are environmentally sustainable, and we've got the criteria for climate-related economic activities. We will be living through an escalator of increased reporting requirements over a four-year period where, with each year, we grow the amount of reporting that will be required.
Separately, in the U.K., we introduced requirements for climate-related financial disclosure for premium-listed companies, those that comply with the highest standards of regulation and corporate governance. We're now in the first reporting season of that. That requirement will be extended to other listed companies and to asset managers, asset owners, pension funds and private companies over the next three years.
WSJ: Are there any lessons about compliance that companies elsewhere can draw from companies in the EU?
MS. HAVARD-WILLIAMS: What we've found is that making that step is quite a big step, and therefore there is a lot of effort behind the scenes. People have found that they needed to start early, they needed to have a structured approach, because there's a lot of climate disclosure in the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure recommendations. It feels different when you're doing it in a regulatory context. There's more rigor to it.
WSJ: How much time do companies have once the SEC regulations are formalized to start preparing their reporting?
MR. KHANNA: The rules assume a compliance period that begins at the end of this year. But there's a ramp-up, depending on the kind of company you are, the size, in terms of your emissions reporting, that starts in 2023, 2024 and so forth. The SEC is trying to give companies some breathing room to start looking at their operations and begin to take steps in moving from informal to formal.
WSJ: What regulation do companies need to be keeping an eye on? In the U.S., Satyam, are there going to be more regulations coming in from authorities other than the SEC?
MR. KHANNA: The Biden administration has outlined a "whole of government" approach that mandates that all of Washington get involved in corporate climate issues. In the U.S. the SEC is part of a constellation of financial regulators, and a lot of those regulators have expressed some interest in climate-related financial risks.
Some have put out requests for comment, some have put out guidance. There's a lot to keep track of.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The nation's biggest oil industry trade group has drafted a proposal urging Congress to adopt a carbon tax, which would put a surcharge on gasoline and other fossil fuels to discourage greenhouse-gas emissions.
The draft proposal was approved by the American Petroleum Institute's climate committee last month, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The measure must still be approved by the group's executive committee.
A carbon tax would raise gasoline prices and other energy costs for consumers. Some API members want to delay action on the proposal amid near-record prices at the pump, contending it could alienate not only voters but Republican lawmakers friendly to the oil industry ahead of midterm elections, according to people involved in the discussions or who were briefed on them.
"The worst case is not get the policy, and lose the friends," one of the people said. "Today, that's probably the most likely possibility."
Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana, lead Republican on the House Select Climate Committee, said Thursday the idea of a carbon tax "is just idiotic right now" given Russia's invasion of Ukraine and high energy prices.
"It is mind-boggling that anyone could look at the current state of affairs and conclude that putting an additional tax on American gasoline and energy is a solution for anything," he said.
The API proposal calls for assessing gasoline wholesalers, power plants and others a tax starting at $35 to $50 a ton for carbon dioxide generated by the fossil fuel they sell or use, with annual adjustments for inflation and other factors, according to the document reviewed by the Journal.
Some Democrats who once supported a carbon tax now oppose it, on grounds that the costs are passed on to consumers, including many who can't afford it.
The proposal suggests rebating some of the revenue collected by the carbon tax to households and investing the rest in new technology.
The draft proposal says a carbon tax is "the most impactful and transparent way to achieve meaningful progress on the dual goals of reducing greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions while simultaneously ensuring continued economic growth."
The measure is a follow-up to last year's decision by API to push Congress for legislation to price carbon emissions across the economy, in what was a policy turnabout a decade after the organization helped to kill a similar plan.
API spokeswoman Megan Bloomgren said the proposal was under a routine review by the organization, which she said was "focused on the most transparent and impactful ways to reduce emissions at the lowest cost for American families."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is restoring stricter environmental standards for approving new pipelines, highways, power plants and other construction projects, including requiring consideration of how such projects might affect climate change.
The changes announced Tuesday reinstate National Environmental Policy Act measures that had been removed by former President Donald Trump, who said that federal regulations were needlessly hindering much-needed infrastructure projects.
Under the stricter reviews, federal agencies must take into account the cumulative impacts that a project or a new proposed federal regulation would have in areas such as air and water quality, wildlife habitat and climate change, according to a White House statement. The new guidelines widen the scope of environmental reviews beyond direct and indirect effects.
The Trump administration had deleted from the regulations the definition of cumulative effects, which called on regulators to take into account long-term impacts such as frequent exposure to toxic air. Environmental groups said that absence of that definition confused regulators on whether to analyze those effects.
"Restoring these basic community safeguards will provide regulatory certainty, reduce conflict, and help ensure that projects get built right the first time," said Brenda Mallory, chairwoman of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality, which helps federal agencies abide by the 1970s law that governs the review process.
The revisions will take effect next month.
Environmental groups have cited violations to the law's provisions in their legal challenges to projects that build out U.S. infrastructure supporting the oil and gas industry. Before its abandonment, the Keystone XL oil pipeline had gotten tied up in court over an environmental review.
Calgary-based Enbridge Inc., one of the largest natural-gas pipeline operators in the U.S., argued to keep some of the Trump era changes. Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes said the company is reviewing Tuesday's changes, and referred to the company's previous statement that "reverting to less efficient and predictable NEPA regulations will not just affect oil and gas pipelines but will delay and complicate the development of new energy facilities and infrastructure."
No change was made to rules adopted under Mr. Trump that require full environmental-impact statements to be completed within two years and less comprehensive reviews to be finished within one year.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business trade groups opposed restoring the measures when first proposed last year. Among other objections, the Chamber said the stricter environmental reviews could stall needed improvements funded by the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed by President Biden last year.
The groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the American Chemistry Council, pointed out that the regulations could impede construction of new transmission lines to connect clean-energy projects like wind-turbine farms to the power grid.
"With rapidly rising inflation, major supply-chain disruptions and workforce shortages, the last thing our country needs is unnecessarily extensive and duplicative bureaucratic red tape and delayed project approvals," Marty Durbin, the Chamber's senior vice president for policy, said Tuesday.
Ted Boling, a former Council on Environmental Quality official during the Obama and Trump administrations who helped develop the 2020 revisions, said he doesn't think the revisions will slow down infrastructure projects. That is because CEQ officials left most of Trump's changes intact, he said, and the revisions they did make will provide clearer guidelines to regulators.
Matthew Davis, senior director of government affairs of the League of Conservation Voters, disagreed, saying government approvals are often faulted for holding up projects when other factors such as funding delays are the real cause. "It's convenient to blame permitting, but that's not usually the case," he said.
Environmental groups said restoring regulations marked a step in the right direction for legally required reviews, but that more needs to be done.
"The Biden administration still has work to do to ensure federal decision makers prioritize the input of front-line and historically marginalized communities and fully restore" the law's previous provisions, said Mustafa Santiago Ali, vice president of environmental justice, climate and community revitalization for the National Wildlife Federation.
White House officials said they are considering additional guidance on greenhouse-gas emissions and plan to propose another round of review-process changes in the next few months.
Leslie Fields, the Sierra Club's national director of policy, advocacy and legal, said the next round of rule making is expected to undo more Trump changes to the review process "and restore the principles of informed and science-based decision making, transparency, and public engagement."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden will nominate Michael Barr, a former Treasury Department official, to serve as the Federal Reserve's top banking regulator, the White House said, after Mr. Biden's first pick for the job withdrew in the face of opposition from Republicans and a key Democratic senator.
If confirmed, Mr. Barr would serve as the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, charged with overseeing the largest U.S. financial firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. A key architect of the 2010 Dodd-Frank postcrisis financial regulatory overhaul and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mr. Barr would likely bring close scrutiny to bank mergers and rules for lending in low-income neighborhoods.
First, though, Mr. Barr would need to win confirmation in the 50-50 Senate, where many Republicans are expected to line up against him. If all GOP senators oppose him, he would need to win the support of every Senate Democrat, including centrists and progressives, a task that has proved challenging for some of Mr. Biden's previous nominees to top financial regulatory posts.
Mr. Biden's first pick for the top Fed banking job, Sarah Bloom Raskin, withdrew her nomination after pivotal centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) opposed her because of her views on climate change. Unlike Ms. Raskin, Mr. Barr hasn't called on the Fed to take an active role in addressing climate change, a difference that some observers think will help him win the support of centrists.
Mr. Barr has faced skepticism among some progressives, who have said that Obama-era efforts to protect homeowners from foreclosure didn't go far enough. Amid that criticism, the White House passed over Mr. Barr for another top regulatory job, Comptroller of the Currency, and ultimately selected a different nominee, Saule Omarova, a Cornell University law professor. Ms. Omarova withdrew after several centrist Democrats challenged her views on bank oversight and addressing climate change.
After Ms. Raskin's and Ms. Omarova's withdrawals, some banking experts see Mr. Barr's nomination as a White House tack toward the center.
"Certainly the political winds have shifted," said Jesse Van Tol, the president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, who supports Mr. Barr's nomination. "There's a sense that perhaps there was an overreach in terms of what was possible. I mean, after all, the political calculus is 50 votes in the Senate."
Mr. Biden said in a statement that Mr. Barr "has strong support from across the political spectrum." The president said Mr. Barr "understands that this job is not a partisan one, but one that plays a critical role in regulating our nation's financial institutions to ensure Americans are treated fairly and to protect the stability of our economy."
Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said he had concerns about Mr. Barr, adding that he looked forward to considering his nomination.
"Michael Barr has defended Dodd Frank's big-bank bailout mechanism, which enshrined into law taxpayer bailouts of banks. He was also the primary author of the unconstitutional and unaccountable CFPB," he said. The Supreme Court ordered changes to the bureau's structure in 2020 after finding its director held too much power.
Mr. Barr, currently the dean of the University of Michigan's public policy school, didn't respond to requests for comment.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a top progressive on the Senate Banking Committee, said she intended to support Mr. Barr's nomination, as did Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio.), the chairman of the panel. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), a progressive who helped craft the Dodd Frank Act, however, said in a statement that he was undecided.
"I'm not going to make up my mind about this nomination until I have a chance to sit down with Mr. Barr," Mr. Merkley said.
The absence of a Senate-confirmed leader at any of the top roles at the Fed, OCC or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has worried advocates for tighter regulation. They fear that Democrats are losing an opportunity to put their imprint on key questions like how to address the risks presented by climate change.
If confirmed, Mr. Barr would face the question of whether and how to reverse regulatory changes made during the Trump administration, when the central bank eased the financial rulebook for Wall Street, lowering capital and other cash-management requirements for U.S. lenders with less than $700 billion in assets, for example.
Analysts said Mr. Barr would review the Trump-era rules, but not necessarily reverse all of them.
"The idea that Michael Barr is going to be a bogeyman for industry, I have not seen evidence of," said Paul Thornell, a lobbyist at Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas whose clients include financial-services firms. He said Mr. Barr "could have very easily put in motion colossal changes to the largest financial institutions that would have wound them down, nationalized them, taken over assets, and that is not the product that came out of Dodd Frank."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration announced lease sales for oil and gas drilling on federal land Friday, but said it would sharply reduce the acreage available for leases and charge higher royalties on the oil and gas produced.
The Interior Department said it would make roughly 144,000 acres available for oil and gas drilling through a series of lease sales, an 80% reduction from the footprint of land that had been under evaluation for leasing.
Companies also will be required to pay royalties of 18.75% of the value of what they extract, up from 12.5%. Royalties for onshore oil and gas drilling generated about $1.5 billion to $3 billion a year for the U.S. Treasury during the last decade, according to the Congressional Research Service
The announcement comes after weeks of pressure on the Biden administration to take action to address historically high energy prices driven by the economic rebound from Covid-19 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
As a candidate, President Biden called for ending oil and gas drilling on federal lands as a way to cut greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute to global warming. He ordered a moratorium on new leases on the day he took office.
That moratorium was put on hold by a federal district court judge in Louisiana on June 15, after 13 states with significant oil and gas drilling sued to block it -- saying Congress requires the development of abundant energy resources on public lands.
The states also argued that they would lose money and jobs if the moratorium remained in place while the lawsuit unfolded.
The suit challenged the president's authority to issue the moratorium under federal law, and it wasn't clear Friday whether the plaintiffs would continue with the lawsuit, which had oral arguments scheduled for next month.
Resuming oil and gas leases has been at the top of the industry's wishlist for action in Washington to help reinvigorate U.S. oil production. But Friday's decision is unlikely to deliver quick relief, since even after a lease has been granted it can take months or years to tap the oil in a way that can meaningfully add to supply.
C. Jeffrey Eshelman, chief operating officer at the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a trade group, took issue with the timing of the release late in the afternoon on Good Friday and Passover.
"This administration has begged for more oil from foreign nations, blames American energy producers for price gouging and sitting on leases," Mr. Eshelman said. "Now, on a late holiday announcement, under pressure, it announces a lease sale with major royalty increases that will add uncertainty to drilling plans for years."
The American Exploration and Production Council, which represents independent producers, noted that the Obama administration had held dozens of lease sales by this point in its tenure.
"While today's announcement is a step in the right direction, to really unleash American energy the Biden administration should continue to hold ongoing lease sales pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act, issue permits more expeditiously and provide consistent regulatory certainty," Anne Bradbury, the group's chief executive, said in a statement.
Environmental groups said Mr. Biden is backing away from his campaign promise, and that the lease sale will hurt efforts to stem climate change by cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.
"This is pure climate denial," said Jeremy Nichols, climate and energy program director for the nonprofit environmental group WildEarth Guardians. "While the Biden administration talks a good talk on climate action, the reality is, they're in bed with the oil and gas industry."
Until Friday, the administration hadn't announced any specific plans to resume lease sales for federal land. It had held one offshore lease sale, which was later invalidated by a federal district court judge.
Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said the new leasing program will "prioritize the American people's interests in public lands."
U.S. officials will make 173 parcels available for lease in nine states: Alabama, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming.

Full text: In southeast Finland, climate change is turning the winters shorter but stormier, while the summers are getting longer and hotter. Intent on making the most of their seafront property, a pair of local physicians have planned a home for all seasons. Marked by charcoal-black cladding, a pale-green roof, and numerous sea views, the year-round residence has triple-glazed windows to protect against months of freezing temperatures and the increase in rough weather, but can do double-duty as an ideal summer house, thanks to air conditioning, a deck for grilling out and a stretch of private shore line.
Cardiologist Juha Koskinen, 37, and his wife, Anna Jaakola, a 35-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist, paid around $130,000 for the half-acre lot, located just outside Kotka, a medium-size coastal city near Finland's border with Russia, about 90 miles east of Helsinki. They then went on to spend around $718,000 to build the almost 2,400 square-foot home, which has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.
The couple share the home with their newborn son and three Alaskan Klee Kais, a small Husky-like breed.
Until 2019, they had been going back and forth between Kotka, Dr. Jaakola's hometown, and Turku, a city in Finland's far southwest, where the two had gone to medical school and later did their residencies. In 2017, in preparation for settling down back east, they purchased the lot, carved out of a stretch of coastal forest newly opened to development. Construction started in 2019, and they moved into the finished house in fall 2020.
The couple knew they had the right spot but then all bets were off. "We didn't have any idea what we were doing and didn't really know what we wanted," says Dr. Koskinen, who admits that the most the two could come up with was a loose but contradictory wish for something "traditional but very modern."
After surfing the internet, they found the young Finnish architecture studio of Pirinen & Salo, based in Helsinki and Finland's far north. The architects were able to help them realize their goal by spatially dividing the home into three A-frame wings. In the center, there is a sophisticated, open-plan great room, with furniture by Nordic designers, sleek concrete flooring and a soaring shoreline view. The cabinlike side wings have bedrooms with rustic trappings, including spruce floors.
Wood is the Nordic countries' great natural resource, and it forms the basis of the project. With sustainability goals in mind, the architects used Finnish-made cross-laminated timber, or CLT, a heavy-duty wood product, to frame the building, in place of less expensive, regular wood or more expensive concrete, both of which may incorporate plastic additives. "CLT is considered the really green option," says architect Lauri Salo. It was also substantially faster, allowing the couple to erect the house in a week, rather than the month or more needed for the other materials. At about $228,000, it was also one of the budget's largest items. Exposed CLT-surfaces, which are also spruce, are used for paneling in the bedrooms.
For their $8,700 deck, the couple found a green solution in neighboring Sweden, where a decade-old Stockholm company called OrganoWood has devised a way to impregnate pine with silicates. The final product mimics the resiliency of tropical hardwood, whose popularity in homes has served to deplete rainforests. The process also does away with the need for heavy-metal additives, which are typically used to render ordinary deck wood more durable but can leak out into the environment. Over time, the silicates help give the weathered surface a more uniform tone.
For the unusual black-wood cladding, the architects looked across the Gulf of Finland to Estonia, where a young firm has specialized in its own version of shou sugi ban, the Japanese art of preserving wood through charring. The result, which cost around $27,000, is an iridescent black surface that is stylish as well as sturdy.
At first, the plan was to have a dark roof match the cladding, but Mr. Salo was worried that might turn the house into "a black blob." Then he found a solution during a bike ride in the Finnish countryside, he says, when he saw old buildings whose roofs had rusted a pale shade of green. The light-green eaves, which cost about $23,000, are steeper than usual, helping keep the roof clear of snow in the winter, while the light color reflects heat in summer, he says. The house has two high-tech pumps for underfloor heating and vent-based air conditioning, at a cost of almost $33,000.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the number of hot days in the area -- regarded in this climate as above 77 degrees Fahrenheit -- has increased significantly over the past several decades. And while overall snowfall is down, due to winter starting later, individual local snow storms can be more intense. Dr. Koskinen says he is noticing more intense storms year-round.
Mikael Hilden, a specialist in natural-resource management who heads up the climate-change program at the Finnish Environment Institute in Helsinki, says Finnish homeowners are responding to overall warmer summers by relying on pump technology for cooling, with sales soaring in recent years. Mr. Salo says his residential clients now automatically want air conditioning in their new homes -- a stark change from as recently as five years ago.
From the start, the couple wanted to combine the year-round and vacation housing types in one structure, which meant staying mindful of harsh winters, when nighttime temperatures can get down as low as minus 25 Fahrenheit, and light-filled summers, when highs can reach into the 90s. They spent close to $50,000 on their winter-friendly windows and doors, but their architects suspended the central great room on stilts, giving the home a vacation-house look. The stilted effect also creates an ideal outdoor storage space for family canoes. The dual function didn't add to the overall cost, says Mr. Salo.
Dr. Jaakola says the "more linear, minimalist" design in the great room was planned to emphasize multiseasonal use, while softer materials and wood surfaces in the bedrooms play up the summerhouse feel. As it turned out, she says, "it's actually very refreshing to move between these different spaces" throughout the year. She says the around $2,100 grill has become "the centerpiece" of the home's dual function, serving as a normal grill on sunny summer nights and an outdoor hearth in the dark of winter.
According to Marju Silander, executive director of the Finnish Homeowners' Association, just under half of the country currently has access to a vacation house, though these still tend to be mid-to-late-20th-century cabins, often without heating or insulation. She says the couple's desire to combine functions reflects a prepandemic Finnish trend of upgrading old-fashioned summer houses into more comfortable, year-round second homes. While the couple's plan predates the pandemic itself, it has anticipated Finns' Covid response, says Ms Silander. She says towns are starting to make provisions for homeowners to overlap permanent and second-home usage for a future marked by virtual commuting.
The couple's village, with a year-round population of 5,118, is slumbery for much of the year, but gets lively in July and August, when a nearby restaurant attracts a steady stream of seasonal visitors, and the number of residents exceeds 8,000. The architects responded by closing off the front of the house. Nearly all windows face the water, and a fully integrated garage presents a fortresslike face to passing street traffic. The great room's oversize sea-facing window comes without blinds or shades, but the couple don't mind occasional sea traffic, in the form of summer boats and winter snowmobiles.
Mr. Salo and his partner Teemu Pirinen gave the open kitchen area, equipped with German and Swedish appliances, a special low-lying alcove with the dogs' meals in mind. And they conceived of the second sleeping wing, which has two bedrooms and a utility room, as suitable for children. For a time, the couple used the bedrooms for everything from pandemic-era workouts to a spot for playing the piano. Now that they have reached the parenting stage, with their son's arrival earlier this year, some 16 months after moving in, it's become the children's wing.
Most new garages in Finland are detached, but Dr. Koskinen says their spacious, connected garage helps with an everyday life now marked by balancing parenthood with pet ownership. Dr. Jaakola is enjoying her maternity leave in a home flooded with natural winter scenery -- which, despite hotter summers, can still mean scenic snow cover for up to four months each year. And Dr. Koskinen says he is looking ahead to "cool interior solutions" to his growing son's bedroom, whose own A-frame has a 16-foot ceiling that can accommodate a climbing wall.

WITH THE GRAIN
More and more homeowners are turning to ordinary wood, relying on the environmentally friendly material for style, substance and a dash of luxury.
The first wave of sustainable architecture, starting in the late 20th century, was concerned with energy consumption, says Uli Dangel, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Texas at Austin. But now that many homes have highly effective insulation and more efficient ways to heat and cool, the emphasis has moved on to concerns about the carbon footprint of preparing, using and disposing of building materials. Wood -- which stores carbon, and can be recycled -- is the winner, hands down, he says, with steel and concrete losing out.
Wood is not only better for the environment, but better for the eye, says Utah architect Chris Price, who specializes in energy-efficient residential projects in the booming Park City market. In 2019, Mr. Price, founder of the Klima Architecture studio, designed a 5,100-square-foot solar-powered Park City five-bedroom, built to passive-house standards, at a cost of $2.3 million. For the interiors, the project uses light-stained oak floors with high-performance wood paneling. On the outside cladding, Mr. Price relied again on modified, high-performance wood, this time with a charred-wood finish. His source was the Austin-based company, Delta Millworks, which specializes in sustainable cladding and decking.
Robbie Davis, Delta's owner, says environmentally-friendly ways of enhancing softer woods are leading to results that have the benefits of hardwood. Delta can create color-customized finishes, he says, at a cost of up to $20 per square foot.
Elsewhere in Austin, Prof. Dangel and his wife, Tamie Glass, achieved eye-catching results in the wood surfaces of their own house. He chose longleaf pine planks pre-treated with alcohol -- "to pop" the grain, he says -- and then cured with environmentally-friendly oil. In the primary bedroom, the floors and wood beams may still look like wood, but have the opulence of marble.

Full text: BRIDGEWATER, N.J. -- Democrat Jennifer Loughran spent the pandemic's early days sewing face masks for neighbors. Last month, as a newly elected school-board member, she voted to lift the district's mask mandate. That came four months after she voted for the state's Republican candidate for governor.
After a monthslong political identity crisis, Ms. Loughran decided her opposition to her party's mask mandates, economic restrictions and school-closure policies outweighed her support for positions on climate change, abortion and gay rights, at least for the moment.
Watching her daughter fall behind in virtual kindergarten, Ms. Loughran had grown so frustrated not knowing when her children would return to the classroom that she joined a group that attracted right-leaning parents in its school-reopening push. She was unhappy that Gov. Phil Murphy didn't fight to reopen schools sooner, and she associated his fellow Democrats with mask mandates and restrictions.
She hasn't decided which party to pick this fall in her local House race, a contest expected to help determine control of Congress. "What I do know," she said, "is that my party-line vote shouldn't be taken for granted anymore."
The defection of once-loyal voters like Ms. Loughran -- along with disapproval from independents -- is among the challenges Democrats face in their bid to retain control of Congress and win state-level races in this November's midterm elections. These voters say Democratic officials left pandemic restrictions in place too long and mishandled the health crisis, with devastating consequences for their children, while Republicans have generally pushed to minimize school closures and keep the economy open.
The party out of power usually wins midterm elections during a president's first term. Public-opinion surveys signal that the trend is holding firm. A Wall Street Journal poll taken in March showed that 46% of U.S. voters plan to back Republican candidates for Congress, while 41% would support Democrats.
On the pandemic, the Journal poll showed voters believed Democrats were best able to get the pandemic under control by a 9-percentage-point margin. But that was down from 16 points just four months earlier.
Regionally, one of the most significant drops in the party's pandemic-management approval was in the Northeast, where a 30-point edge for Democrats in November had dropped to 20 points last month, the Journal poll showed. The drop was driven mainly by independents, among whom the party's 12-point advantage in the previous poll had evaporated. In the new survey, independent voters were split 29% to 29% over which party was best able to handle Covid-19.
Ms. Loughran, a 45-year-old skateboard instructor with red dip-dyed hair and a blue-collar upbringing, had speared an Obama-Biden sign into her suburban home's lawn and waived a handmade placard at the Women's March in New York during President Donald Trump's first year in office.
Her party allegiance began to erode during lockdowns as she and her husband, Michael Loughran, juggled her oldest daughter's virtual kindergarten, a toddler tolling countless iPad hours and an infant who was diagnosed with a deadly genetic disorder. Her vote for Jack Ciattarelli as New Jersey's governor was the first time she had backed a Republican in a state or federal contest.
The shift in the New Jersey electorate last fall shocked the political establishment and nearly cost the incumbent Mr. Murphy a second term. Advisers to Mr. Murphy said the campaign underestimated Covid frustration inside the Democratic Party.
The governor has taken steps to address that. Mr. Murphy, who had supported strict measures to stem Covid's spread, was the first of several Democratic governors to lift statewide mask mandates.
Mr. Ciattarelli, on the campaign trail, said the governor should have done more to make the vaccine available to teachers sooner and reopen schools faster. Mr. Ciattarelli, in an interview, said he wouldn't have come so close to winning without support from Democratic and independent voters and sensed some of that backing was rooted in pandemic fatigue.
In the Virginia governor's contest, Glenn Youngkin made parental involvement in schools a top issue and became the first Republican to win the seat in 12 years. His first major legislative action as governor was to end the state's mask mandate in schools.
Democratic voters broadly support their party's pandemic response. In a March poll from Rutgers University, 52% of voters graded Gov. Murphy's Covid response as an "A" or "B," the highest grade for any of the 11 issues tested in the poll. In the Journal's national poll, 49% of voters said they approved of President Biden's handling of the virus, among his highest approval ratings in a list of issues included in the survey.
Ms. Loughran's husband, an unaffiliated voter who typically backs Democrats for state and federal office, said he shared his wife's frustrations over the party's Covid response. But he weighted that issue differently in his calculation to back Gov. Murphy for a second term. "I thought whoever was going to be in office would drop the mask mandates either way," he said. "Some of that kind of stuff was going to take care of itself."
Interviews with New Jersey voters revealed that some Democrats' breaks from their party last fall were neither flippant nor fleeting. Many described personal struggles to stress what they viewed as the needs of their family or community over partisanship. For some, mandates over vaccines and masks violated personal convictions over choices about their health that sparked fears about other potential invasions of privacy. Others expressed a newfound nuance to their political approach.
Democratic voters who have broken from their party over Covid often describe decisions they reached only after wrestling with issues such as their support for abortion rights and opposition to gun control.
Among them is Gina Genovese, a longtime Democratic voter until November, when she cast her ballot for Mr. Ciattarelli. She ran for New Jersey governor as an independent in 2017 and was the state's first openly gay mayor in 2006 when she presided over Long Hill, N.J., as a Democrat.
She said she was turned off by her party's support for mask and vaccine mandates, which she viewed as violations of personal freedom. Last year, she helped finance a lawsuit that unsuccessfully attempted to strike Gov. Murphy's mask requirement inside schools. "Democrats have left me so disillusioned," she said.
Ms. Genovese described herself as "far-left" on global warming and gay rights and said it was a tough decision to support Republicans during the pandemic. She said she would probably back the Republican Thomas H. Kean Jr. for Congress this fall.
"I'm a pro-choice person -- my body, my choice," she said, applying a phrase from the debate over abortion to the issue of mask and vaccine mandates.
Bridgewater, an upper-middle-class suburb in northern New Jersey, last fall backed the GOP's Mr. Ciattarelli by 5 percentage points over Mr. Murphy just one year after it delivered Joe Biden's campaign a 12-point victory. Statewide, Mr. Murphy won by 3 percentage points; Mr. Biden won by 16 points.
Bridgewater is in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District, represented by Democrat Tom Malinowski, whose likely challenger is Mr. Kean, a former state lawmaker and son of a former New Jersey governor. The state legislature's Democrats redrew the district this year, making several other districts safer for Democratic incumbents while jeopardizing Mr. Malinowski's re-election. The district remains majority Democratic, but by a 3.7-point margin instead of 9.9 points.
Mr. Malinowski pushed to reopen schools in early 2021, calling on the Biden administration to ensure teachers were among the first to be vaccinated and urging state officials to do the same. Still, he said, "There has been a lot of frustration over the impact on families and kids staying home that some Democrats were slow to recognize."
Mr. Kean said he has seen pandemic frustration manifested in the campaign as inflation has become a concern. "We lost an entire year of learning," he said, "and New Jersey only got less and less affordable."
Rachel Keane, a 35-year-old registered nurse and mother of two just outside the district in West Orange, N.J., said she had never voted Republican until last fall, when she opted for Mr. Ciattarelli and every other Republican candidate on her ballot. She had always supported Democrats without a second thought, but her anger over the governor's mask requirements for children made her question that loyalty. "I knew I wasn't going to vote for Murphy, but wasn't sure if I was going to leave it blank or what," she said. "Then I just got angry. . .And I voted Republican all the way down the line."
She said Mr. Murphy was too slow to push for a return to the classroom, which raised doubts for her about whether schools would open and stay open. That stress prompted her to keep her 5-year-old in private daycare instead of sending him to kindergarten, which has cost her family about $1,200 a month. She said she remained distressed about her party and wasn't sure how she would vote this fall.
Ben Ashfield and Tammy Tiranasar, self-described former liberals who now vote Republican, opened The Village Electric, a co-learning center in Mountainside, N.J., aimed at like-minded families during the pandemic. The center operates as a de facto school for home-school families, and it attracted parents and staff who wanted to be part of an education system that didn't require masks or ask about vaccine status.
One of the teachers, 56-year-old Donna Davis, said she had been a Democratic voter until the pandemic, when the Republican push to keep the economy open made her more receptive to conservative candidates. When schools started requiring masks and pushing for vaccines, she didn't want to do either to return to the classroom and thought her teaching days were over -- until she heard about the learning center. She supported Mr. Ciattarelli and plans to vote Republican this fall.
For Ms. Loughran, a family health crisis magnified pandemic struggles. On March 13, 2020, the day President Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency, the Loughrans learned their 11-month-old boy Finn had Tay-Sachs disease. The rare disorder attacks nerve cells and is what the Loughrans believed had taken their 14-month-old first child, Sylvia, in 2012.
Ms. Loughran had learned to sew to cope with the heartbreak. After Finn's diagnosis, her husband, a 42-year-old IT consultant, persuaded her to do something with the fabric scraps strewn around the house. She stitched a mask, a fox print inspired by her son's nickname, Finny the Fox.
A picture of the mask on Facebook promoted an outpouring of help from friends and strangers who made and distributed more masks. She incorporated The Mask Squad, a nonprofit whose volunteers made up to 100 masks a day.
Finn's treatment was grueling and isolating. Covid restrictions meant she was the only family member present when he was hospitalized. After doctors exhausted their options, her living room functioned as a classroom, playroom and hospice. Finn died at 17 months on Oct. 3, 2020, at home in his mother's arms.
"It was impossible," said Ms. Loughran, "and I had a lot of support." She channeled her grief into working to return some normalcy by getting her daughters back to school. The eldest, Sarafina, was in first grade and still attending school virtually. The youngest, Eilish, would start kindergarten in the fall of 2021.
Ms. Loughran attended school-board meetings and began pushing for the schools to reopen. In March 2021, she was a featured speaker at a rally organized by parents who wanted the district to reopen schools full time. The issue was becoming her priority, but the only elected officials she saw when she looked around the rally were Republicans.
"Jennifer brought a lot of energy and a lot of compassion," said Adam Juechter, a 56-year-old software salesman involved with the open-schools group. "This was about the kids, not politics, and there was a level of credibility she was able to give the group and to our goal."
Her Mask Squad was apolitical but attracted support from many neighborhood Democrats. The school group was mainly Republican parents such as Mr. Juechter. Their rally included speeches from conservative politicians including Mr. Ciattarelli, who had grown up in neighboring Raritan and represented the area as a state lawmaker.
"Everybody wanted their kids back in school -- it wasn't just Republicans," Ms. Loughran said. "But we couldn't stop fighting about it." The debate felt like an ideological crisis, she said. "I didn't understand where I fit."
Ms. Loughran had a foot in the mask movement and another in the back-to-school effort, and friends from both persuaded her to run for school board. The idea of helping unify her neighborhood appealed to her.
Days before the gubernatorial election, she remained torn. She sharply disagreed with Mr. Ciattarelli's views on climate change and social issues.
Mr. Loughran encouraged his wife to attend the Republican candidate's rally in Bridgewater on the campaign's final day. She viewed Mr. Ciattarelli as the "hometown guy" and liked that he pushed to reopen schools and didn't attack Mr. Murphy in his speech.
When Mr. Ciattarelli vowed to win over the "1%" of the crowd that wasn't already supporting him, Ms. Loughran's friends from the school-reopening group gave her encouraging looks.
Ms. Loughran ran from the rally, still struggling with her vote and not wanting her presence captured by cameras. Her grandmother and aunts, staunch Democrats, had marched with Martin Luther King Jr., and Ms. Loughran worried about betraying them. She weighed her support for Democratic positions on cultural issues and how her support for a Republican might disappoint her gay and transgender friends.
The next day, she cast her ballot for the Republican -- what she described as a pragmatic calculation in which her family and community would be best served by the "local guy."
Although Mr. Ciattarelli came up short, Ms. Loughran won a school-board seat in the nonpartisan race. She was sworn in during a virtual meeting in January with a picture of Finn behind her. In March, she celebrated a unanimous vote from the board to lift the mask mandate.
"The lesson I took away from this was that people are capable of rising to the occasion without being mandated by the government," she said. "Government isn't the solution. It's a tool, and we need to be more skilled at using it."
In February, Ms. Loughran had attended a meet-and-greet with Mr. Malinowski, the Democratic congressman. He made small talk with her about Skateistan, an international nonprofit group that teaches skateboarding to underprivileged kids, she said.
She joked that she was impressed by his skateboarding acumen but added that she still had more to learn before deciding how to vote this fall.

Full text: As more companies report greenhouse-gas emissions, the standards they follow are coming under sharper scrutiny amid criticism that they make the companies seem greener than they are.
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a coalition of environmental groups and businesses, developed what have become the de facto standards for companies to disclose the carbon footprints of their operations, energy use and products, categorizing them as scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.
Companies and investors increasingly rely upon the standards to guide trillions of dollars in environmentally minded investments, while regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission are drawing on them for proposed disclosure requirements aimed at combating climate change.
Now the group is commissioning a review of the standards, spurred in part by concerns that the current guidelines could result in misleading corporate emissions reports or outright greenwashing, the term for making something seem more environmentally friendly than it is, say researchers and others close to the effort.
One big concern: guidelines that let hundreds of companies from Apple Inc. to AstraZeneca PLC say they are procuring carbon-free energy, even though that doesn't always reflect their actual energy consumption.
"Ten years ago, there wasn't actually a huge amount of scrutiny on the numbers the companies were disclosing," said Matthew Brander, a senior lecturer in carbon accounting at the University of Edinburgh Business School who has been a critic of some of the standards. "Increasingly investors are using GHG disclosures to make capital-allocation decisions. And I think that is just turning up the spotlight a little bit on the robustness of the numbers that are being disclosed."
The review of GHG Protocol's standards highlights the high stakes surrounding corporate climate targets and emissions disclosures. Last month, the SEC proposed requiring listed companies to disclose greenhouse-gas emissions along with climate-related risks; European and Japanese regulators are pushing various disclosure plans.
GHG Protocol, which has been developing the standards for the past two decades, said regulatory attention was a big reason for its review.
"GHG Protocol is planning additional guidance to enhance implementation of its standards and align with accounting rules under development," said Pankaj Bhatia, director of GHG Protocol at the World Resources Institute, a climate-focused nonprofit.
Companies and investors world-wide rely on the GHG Protocol's guidelines to set "net zero" pledges to neutralize emissions and measure progress toward low-carbon goals. More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies use GHG Protocol's standards, the group claims.
Well over 1,000 companies set greenhouse-gas-reduction targets, according to the Science Based Targets initiative, which helps firms set goals to trim their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Investors look at such numbers to determine whether the companies they fund are eco-friendly. But as the standards take on more importance, some critics are questioning whether they reflect companies' true carbon footprints.
Some of the sharpest scrutiny focuses on how the standards handle scope 2, or greenhouse-gas emissions associated with companies' energy purchases. Those concerns prompted the GHG Protocol to ask Anders Bjorn, a postdoctoral fellow at Concordia University in Montreal who has done research questioning some target-setting methodologies, to look into the issue, Mr. Bjorn and a person familiar with the matter said. Another Concordia researcher is reviewing the scope 1 and 3 guidelines.
Currently, the GHG Protocol's scope 2 guidance lets companies say they are procuring renewable energy and thus have lower emissions, even if they are consuming electricity the ordinary way off the power grid.
Because companies can't control what kind of electricity they are getting from that shared grid, which can include everything from coal-fired power plants to nuclear facilities, many resort to buying financial instruments that let them take credit for the "greenness" of carbon-free power.
In some cases, those instruments -- known in the U.S. as renewable energy certificates -- are sold separately from the actual energy generated. RECs have historically been very cheap, giving companies an inexpensive way to report reduced emissions and leading to fears that those claims could be misleading.
Big companies can claim the grid's green power for accounting purposes while the dirtier energy on the same grid is attributed to homeowners or other power consumers, critics say, noting that the practice may not reduce overall emissions at all.
If "I drive my Hummer to work every day, can I go buy a walk-to-work certificate from some guy on the other side of town that walks to work every day and say my emissions are zero?" asked Michael Gillenwater, co-founder of the Greenhouse Gas Management Initiative, a Seattle nonprofit focused on emissions accounting.
Mr. Gillenwater, along with Mr. Brander, worked on the GHG Protocol's scope 2 guidance before it was released in 2015, but expressed concerns over the final product.
Advocates say the standard has encouraged more companies to commit to clean-power targets, which spurred utilities to build more solar and wind projects and governments to create policies encouraging their construction.
"What companies are doing is sending a very clear market signal," said Sam Kimmins, who heads RE100, a group for firms that pledged to shift to 100% renewable energy. RE100 has nearly 360 members including Apple, AstraZeneca and General Motors Co.
William Gore-Randall, a director at Lazard Asset Management in London, said he became skeptical when he realized how little financial instruments like RECs cost, allowing companies to declare big emissions reductions on the cheap. "Companies are merely putting lip service behind it but not putting money behind it," he said.

Companies Hone
Climate Efforts
More companies, including Apple and Salesforce.com Inc., say they are trying to ensure their renewable-energy purchases actually do reduce emissions by trying to contract from new green-power projects that they helped finance.
Companies like Microsoft Corp. or Alphabet Inc.'s Google say they are testing ways of more accurately matching renewable-energy buys with power consumption on an hourly basis.
Salesforce claims it achieved 100% renewable energy for its operations, using the current standard, but it set tougher greenhouse-gas-reduction targets for 2030 that encompass total emissions on the grids in which it works, said Max Scher, who heads Salesforce's clean energy and carbon programs. The world is counting on big companies during the next decade to dramatically boost the amount of renewable energy, he said. With the current scope 2 accounting standard, "there's a world in which . . . we get [to 2030] and the physical reality of the grid hasn't changed very much," he said.

Full text: Wall Street arranged more bonds and loans for clean-energy projects than oil-and-gas companies in the first quarter. The shift could be short-lived amid the push to boost fossil-fuel supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Banks underwrote more than $100 billion of bonds and loans for clean-energy uses in the first quarter and arranged $95 billion in borrowing for oil-and-gas firms. The pace of underwriting slowed in both categories from last year, when total oil-and-gas and green debt issued in each area totaled about $570 billion.
The shift toward more green-debt underwriting has been dramatic in recent years. The ratio of oil-and-gas to green debt underwritten fell to 0.9 in the first quarter from 1 last year. In 2018, four times as much money was raised by banks for fossil fuels than for clean-energy uses.
Debt underwriting involves finding buyers and backstopping prices when necessary. It is one of the main ways banks help companies and governments raise money. The data don't include direct lending, equity underwriting or other borrowing linked to sustainability measures.
While the overall industry did more green underwriting in the quarter, some banks reversed course. Citigroup Inc. arranged more green debt than fossil-fuel debt for the first time last year. In the first quarter, it did more oil-and-gas debt. Other banks that underwrote more oil-and-gas than green debt while also seeing the ratio increase in the first quarter include Wells Fargo & Co., Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Societe Generale SA.
Banks say they can't transition away from fossil fuels too quickly given limitations on clean-energy capacity and that their lending activity reflects broader industry trends. Oil and natural-gas prices have surged, turbocharged by the war in Ukraine, improving the outlook for many producers and prompting calls for increased output. Meanwhile, supply-chain disruptions have pushed up costs and delayed many clean-energy projects.
Still, some analysts argue that many banks overstate their commitment to limiting climate change because they are still consistently funding fossil fuels.
"It's really tough to know when it's turning into greenwashing," or misleading about climate progress, said Margaret Peloso, a partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP who advises banks on environmental issues.
Many financiers also say they must work with companies to bring down emissions rather than divesting from high-emitting industries.
JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank and biggest energy-sector financier last year, cut the ratio of oil-and-gas to green-debt underwriting to 1.2 last year from 10 in 2018. The ratio stayed at that level in the first quarter, again indicating more fossil-fuel activity than the broader industry. JPMorgan last year pledged oil-and-gas companies in its portfolio would substantially reduce operational carbon intensity -- emissions per unit of output -- by 2030.
Analysts say carbon-intensity targets are less aggressive than outright emissions-reduction figures because carbon intensity can decline while overall emissions increase.
Citigroup in January said it was targeting a large absolute drop in financed energy-sector emissions by 2030, a move that analysts said surpassed similar pledges by its peers. Its ratio of oil-and-gas to green-debt underwriting rose to 1.4 in the first quarter from nearly 1 last year. Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser spoke at last year's Glasgow global summit about the need to scale climate solutions and has said the bank might have to cut off clients to meet its climate targets.
Wells Fargo arranges much more fossil-fuel debt than green debt, with a ratio of 6.7 in the first quarter and 6.3 last year. That is down from 68 in 2018. The San Francisco-based lender recently joined other banks in saying it would cut its net emissions to zero by 2050.
Among the energy companies that raised billions in debt through large banks in the first quarter were commodity traders Vitol SA and Trafigura Pte. Ltd. and oil-and-gas producer ConocoPhillips.
Many environmentalists are also concerned that the pace of clean-energy financing is slowing, delaying the spending needed to reach the world's climate goals and reduce global reliance on oil and gas. Biotech firm Amgen Inc. and Honda Motor Co. were among those that raised green bonds to reduce emissions last quarter, but the total amount raised was well below last year's pace.
Some analysts say between five and 10 times last year's total in green bonds and loans is needed annually by the middle of the decade to accelerate the energy transition.
"The rest of this year will give us a good indication of whether it's feasible or not," said Krista Tukiainen, head of market intelligence at the Climate Bonds Initiative, a nonprofit promoting green investment.

Full text: Countries must make major, rapid shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy to meet the goals in the 2015 Paris agreement, climate experts tapped by the United Nations said in a report released Monday.
Carbon-dioxide emissions must be halved by 2030 from estimated 2019 levels, and methane emissions cut by a third, if warming is to stay within 1.5 degrees Celsius past preindustrial levels, a target in the Paris accord, scientists assembled by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said.
Countries are off track to meet those goals, climate experts said. The last decade saw the highest average yearly greenhouse-gas emissions from human activities ever recorded. Current climate policies are set to push global average temperatures between 2.4 and 3.5 degrees Celsius past preindustrial levels by the end of the century, the report said.
"We know time is running out," said Michael Grubb, an economist and energy policy expert at University College London, and a lead author of the report. "All the economic analyses suggest the need for more rapid and substantial emissions reductions" to levels that aren't reflected in climate plans from countries, he said.
There are some signs of progress. At least 18 countries have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions for a decade or more, and more city and local governments have made climate pledges.
"The fact that we've experienced this highest increase in greenhouse-gas emissions this past decade, in spite of this action, is worrisome," said Karen Seto, an urban scientist at Yale University and a lead author of the report. "There's an urgency now."
Dramatic cost drops in solar, wind and other renewable technologies present the best opportunity yet to forgo fossil fuels and cut carbon-dioxide emissions, the report said. Between 2010 and 2019, the cost to manufacture and sell solar energy technology fell 85%, while corresponding costs for wind energy and lithium-ion batteries have dropped 55% and 85%, respectively.
"That's really changed the conversation," said Jessika Trancik, an energy engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wasn't involved with the report. Dr. Trancik's work showed that the steep drop in solar and lithium-ion battery technology was enabled by market-expansion policies as well as investment in research and development by governments and the private sector.
The report considers the role of carbon-removal technologies -- ranging from planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide to more nascent technologies that use chemical processes to trap carbon dioxide from the air -- more thoroughly than before. These have a limited role to play, to balance emissions from sectors that are known to be challenging to cut back, such as agriculture and aviation, the report states.
"We're talking about offsetting about 10% of our emissions," said Gregory Nemet, a public policy researcher who studies energy and climate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a lead author of the report. "The rest of the work, that's 80 or 90% of the emissions reductions, has to be done elsewhere."
IPCC reports are regarded as the most comprehensive reviews of the state of climate science.
Emissions from human activities have resulted in the Earth warming 1.1 degrees Celsius since about 1850, according to the IPCC. Monday's report was prepared by 278 scientists from 65 countries.
For the first time, the IPCC panel broadly evaluated how changes to daily activities and lifestyle could contribute to emissions reductions. Walking or biking instead of driving, shifting to sustainable diets that use less land and water, reducing food wastes and designing buildings that are more energy-efficient are all examples of shifts that contribute, the report said. Cumulatively, such changes could contribute between 40% and 70% of emissions reductions by 2050.
Such behavioral changes could only be effective if backed by institutions or governments, the report states. For example, if local municipalities invested in public transport systems or bike lanes, that would offer commuters a low-carbon option to get to work.

Full text: Matt Byrne's family has been grazing cattle on the same Northern California pasture land for six generations. About a decade ago, Mr. Byrne joined forces with another California cowboy, Chris Donati, to form a network of like-minded ranchers across the American West. "We named our business SunFed Ranch, because every blade of grass is a solar panel," Mr. Byrne said. SunFed Ranch's cattle are sustained by grasslands, which they fertilize as they graze.
Though all SunFed Ranch's animals are 100% grass fed and free of hormones, steroids and antibiotics, less than half carry a USDA organic seal. Many ranchers, wary of having their management decisions dictated from afar, have been resistant to the certification. Recently, though, SunFed Ranch has begun pursuing a different label: regenerative.
Natural, sustainable, organic: yesterday's news. When it comes to virtuous eating, "regenerative" is the buzzword du jour. But what, exactly, does it mean? The term lacks a single legal or regulatory definition, which makes for a complicated answer. Broadly speaking, "regenerative agriculture" describes a holistic approach to farming focused on continuously improving the health of the soil, increasing biodiversity and drawing greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere and into the ground.
The SunFed Ranch network now has 150,000 acres evaluated annually by Land to Market, a verification program that ensures a farm is having a positive impact on ecosystem health by measuring things like the presence or absence of bare soil and plant-life diversity. Meat from the cattle grazing on those acres has made its way into Applegate's Do Good Dog, the organic meat pioneer's first product labeled "regeneratively sourced."
Two years after Whole Foods Market dubbed regenerative agriculture a top food trend, grocery shelves everywhere now feature a growing assortment of products touted for their climate-friendly credentials, from bone broth to breakfast cereals, rice, chicken, yogurt and snack bars. "These oats help save the planet," boasts the box front of a limited-edition Nature's Path Regenerative Organic Instant Oatmeal released in 2020. A line of regeneratively farmed fruit, vegetable and grain purees from Happy Family Organics is emblazoned with the slogan "Farmed for our future."
This is not a boutique trend. In 2019, General Mills announced a commitment to advancing so-called regenerative practices on 1 million acres of farmland by 2030; PepsiCo followed suit in 2021 with a pledge to do the same across its entire 7-million-acre agricultural footprint. Nestle SA said recently that it would invest $1.3 billion over the next five years to help farmers transition to regenerative practices.
Appreciating the need for regeneration requires first understanding the level of degeneration in agricultural soils. Over the past century, extensive tillage -- churning the soil between each crop cycle -- has carried off topsoil, releasing carbon into the atmosphere. Chemical herbicides and pesticides have killed off soil microbes. Monocultures of corn, rice and wheat have stripped soil of its nutrients. Confinement livestock operations have polluted ground and surface water with animal waste.
The term "regenerative agriculture" first appeared in the 1980s, but the current mania for it seems to have been touched off by a 2014 white paper by the Rodale Institute, a nonprofit that supports research into organic farming, entitled "Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change." That paper outlined how implementing certain soil-friendly farming practices could sequester vast quantities of atmospheric carbon below ground.
It was around this time that Yvon Chouinard, the outdoorsman, conservationist and founder of the outdoor apparel company Patagonia, launched a new venture with co-founder Birgit Cameron called Patagonia Provisions: a maker of food products featuring ingredients touted as actively healing the earth as they grow. "We've come to the conclusion that the best thing we can possibly do is support regenerative agriculture," Mr. Chouinard said in a Q&A published by Patagonia in 2018. "With regenerative agriculture, you're able to grow more nutritious, better-tasting food; you're growing topsoil; and you're capturing carbon -- so it's a way of farming that's a win-win-win-win situation."
An early example of this ethos was Patagonia Provisions' buffalo jerky. Prairie grasslands act like a carbon sponge, and the presence of buffalo is essential to maintaining their vitality. The animals aerate the soil with their pointed hooves while fertilizing the grasses and dispersing their seeds as they roam. Raising buffalo for meat is a way to actively support and improve the health of that ecosystem.
Employing grazing animals to enrich the soil is one keystone concept of regenerative farming. Others are using crop rotation to continuously cycle nutrients in the soil and keeping roots in the ground whenever possible to prevent erosion. To anyone who has been hanging around the organic farming punch bowl for long enough, this might sound awfully familiar. Soil health has always been at the heart of organic farming, but as the market has expanded and industrialized -- USDA organic products are now an over $60 billion category in the United States, with annual growth in the double digits -- purists worry that a once-robust set of principles has been boiled down to mean little more than the avoidance of synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides.
But if "organic" is at risk of losing its soul, "regenerative" is even more susceptible to use and abuse by anyone who wants to telegraph climate-friendly values with little in the way of follow-through. Unlike organic, the latter term has no legally binding definition, and bold claims about how much carbon regenerative practices could sequester -- whether, for instance, a grass-fed cow could ever erase its own carbon footprint -- are still a matter of intense scientific debate.
"What regenerative means is entirely dependent on who is speaking," said Dave Chapman, executive director of the Real Organic Project, a nonprofit that produces an add-on certification for farmers who go above and beyond the USDA organic label. "The challenges the organic movement faces in terms of corporate takeover is exactly what's happening in the regenerative movement, only with regenerative, it's happening more quickly."
For now, there is no single litmus test for determining whether a product's regenerative claims are legitimate, but a few certifications have materialized to help consumers sort fact from fiction. For livestock farmers, the Savory Institute's Land to Market seal -- the one that verifies products from SunFed Ranch and a total of 2.5 million acres of rangeland globally -- takes a novel approach by measuring the actual environmental impacts of a farming operation, rather than stipulating certain practices as on or off limits. Verified farms must show continuous improvement to the health of their land, as defined by measures such as soil carbon content and changes in the soil's water-holding capacity. But unlike USDA organic, Land to Market doesn't explicitly prohibit the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers or GMOs.
Since 2017, the nonprofit group Regenerative Organic Alliance -- backed by the Rodale Institute, Patagonia and the natural soapmaker Dr. Bronner's -- has been at work developing its Regenerative Organic Certified (ROC) program, which is seen by many as the gold standard for validating regenerative claims. ROC requires farms to be USDA Organic as a starting point, then layers in additional requirements around animal welfare, social fairness and an array of soil-health measures.
For many proponents of the regenerative movement, building around the USDA organic certification, rather than creating an alternative, is key to ensuring that the term doesn't lose its meaning. While there is plenty of debate about whether the organic label lives up to its original aims, it remains the only federally overseen certification program of the bunch, which provides a level of credibility that is hard to match. "We all see 'organic' as a hard-earned designation," said Elizabeth Whitlow, the executive director of the Regenerative Organic Alliance. She doesn't view the regenerative label as competing with the organic one but, rather, as "a way to keep it strong."

Close Reading
A concise glossary of food-label terminology
Natural
This means a product is free of artificial or synthetic dyes, coloring, flavorings and preservatives. Items labeled "natural" can still contain GMOs, as well as ingredients grown using agricultural chemicals or synthetic fertilizers.
Free-range
Use of this term only requires that animals have access to the outdoors -- no stipulation as to whether they do, in fact, spend any time there.
Cage-free
This designation, typically applied to eggs, means just what it says: The animals cannot be kept in cages. But they can still be heavily crowded into a single barn.
Pasture-raised
This descriptor implies that animals spend their lives roaming outdoors and eating grasses, but there is no federal standard for it, and no regular inspections.
---
Label Conscious / These seals indicate regenerative, organic and other farming practices. Here's what they actually signify.
USDA Organic
This federally overseen certification requires crops to be non-GMO and produced without most synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Grain and hay must be 100% organic, livestock raised without antibiotics or added hormones and with the ability to engage in "natural behaviors," like grazing on pasture.
Real Organic
An add-on to USDA Organic developed by and for producers that farm "to not only the letter, but also the spirit, of certified organic standards." Additional standards mostly concern growing plants in fertile soil -- not hydroponically -- and raising animals humanely, on pasture.
Demeter
For foods grown biodynamically. This includes everything required under the USDA Organic rules, plus more stringent rules for biodiversity and holistic practices, such as relying on livestock, cover crops and crop rotation for soil fertility.
Regenerative Organic Certified
The most stringent regenerative certification. Farms must be USDA Organic and either carry a recognized certification for social fairness and animal welfare or undergo a thorough audit covering those areas. Additional requirements regard building soil health and sequestering carbon.
Land to Market
This regenerative verification program looks at outcomes rather than practices. Farms and ranches undergo annual inspections and testing to demonstrate measurable improvements in such aspects as soil fertility, water infiltration and biodiversity.
Certified Grassfed by AGW or AGA
The term "grass fed" is regulated by the USDA but not strictly enforced. These seals confirm that products come from animals fed a diet of 100% grass and forage, raised on pasture and never treated with hormones or routine antibiotics.

Full text: A consortium of environmental groups launched a campaign to change bitcoin's code to decrease its energy use, which has grown substantially in the past few years.
Bitcoin's energy use has riled environmental groups, alarmed some lawmakers and put the cryptocurrency at odds with a green movement that has supporters on Wall Street. The campaign aims to persuade people involved with the cryptocurrency, from mining companies to investors to software developers, that a change is better for the environment and bitcoin's reputation and support.
Greenpeace USA, Environmental Working Group and others will run ads in media outlets such as the New York Times, Politico and The Wall Street Journal highlighting bitcoin's environmental impact and advocating change. The campaign is funded by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, who isn't representing the cryptocurrency firm in this endeavor. Mr. Larsen said he provided $5 million. Some of the ads are aimed at prominent bitcoin backers, such as Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk, Block Inc. founder Jack Dorsey and Fidelity Investments Chief Executive Abby Johnson.
There have been attempts to lower bitcoin's energy footprint. A consortium of about 250 companies, including miners such as Hut 8 Mining CorpHut 8 Mining Corp., support the Crypto Climate Accord, which aims to switch the industry to renewable energy sources. Some miners, like Easton, Md.-based TeraWulf Inc., are seeking a zero-emissions operation.
The campaign isn't antibitcoin, said Michael Brune, the former executive director of the Sierra Club who is advising the campaign. Rather, he said, it argues that climate change has reached a critical point, and bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, is contributing too much to global warming.
"It's important for anyone in a position to act, to act," he said. "You can't ignore that we are in a climate emergency."
The goal is to persuade bitcoin's community of investors and backers to change the network's code, removing the "proof of work" mechanism that requires bitcoin miners to expend a certain amount of energy while processing transactions to earn rewards in newly created bitcoin. The change could drastically reduce bitcoin's energy use, Mr. Brune said. Bitcoin's energy usage is a defense mechanism designed to protect the network. Because it is an open-source project, anybody can run the bitcoin software.
But the network requires miners to expend vast amounts of computing power to make it prohibitively expensive for somebody to take over the network, which could allow them to create counterfeit bitcoins or erase transactions.
The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates that the bitcoin network uses slightly more energy a year, 134.9 terawatt-hours, than Norway, at 124.3 terawatt-hours. The research institute said, however, that bitcoin uses less energy than is lost in the U.S. during electricity transmission.
Some bitcoin miners have addressed the issue by using more renewable energy sources to power their computers, but Messrs. Brune and Larsen say that isn't enough.
Bitcoin's environmental effects have been an issue for years, but the people in control of it have rejected the kinds of changes being proposed.
Moreover, because bitcoin isn't owned by a company, changing the code requires nearly all of the parties involved in its maintenance -- something on the order of 90% or more -- to agree on a change.
The Ethereum network also uses proof of work but is changing to a model called proof of stake, which essentially swaps energy for cryptocurrency.
That change, the implementation of which has been delayed several times for technical reasons, is expected to reduce Ethereum's electricity usage by 99%. The campaign is hoping to effect a similar switch for bitcoin.

Full text: Russia's invasion of Ukraine has delayed or derailed international collaborations studying climate change in the Arctic, with many Western scientists and scientific organizations cutting ties with Russian research institutions and canceling planned meetings or expeditions in Russia or Russian waters.
International tensions over the conflict could cripple research focused on a region that -- along with the Antarctic -- helps regulate climate across the globe, scientists say. Russia is one of eight countries that control land and ocean territories in the region north of the Arctic Circle.
"The Russian territorial waters and Russian coastline comprise a huge part of the region. We really need to know the full Arctic," said Matthew Shupe, a University of Colorado Boulder atmospheric scientist. "If we're limiting access to those regions, we're going to miss out on some key knowledge to better understand how and why the Arctic system is changing."
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which conducts ecological and weather monitoring in the Arctic, says war-related tensions haven't affected its activities there. "All NOAA projects and observations are proceeding in the Arctic," an agency spokesperson said.
That isn't the case with other key players in Arctic research.
Dr. Shupe is a co-leader of an international Arctic research initiative to study climate change known as MOSAiC, for the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate. As part of the project, scientists aboard the German research ship Polarstern recently spent a year collecting data in the region. Fieldwork for the expedition, which ended in October 2020, involved hundreds of crew, support staff and scientists, including up to 10 researchers from Russia, Dr. Shupe said.
But now Russian scientists aren't expected at an April meeting when MOSAiC researchers will discuss the expedition's data, said Markus Rex, MOSAiC expedition leader and head of atmospheric physics at the Alfred Wegener Institute, the German organization that led the project.
"We're looking at this big pile of data, and they bring a lot of expertise to the table," Dr. Shupe said of his Russian collaborators.
The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to requests for comment about the exclusion of Russian scientists and interruptions to other scientific collaborations.
Local organizers barred Russian scientists this month from the Arctic Science Summit Week, an Arctic-research meeting taking place in Tromso, Norway, hosted by the International Arctic Science Committee, or IASC. The group is a coordinator of international research in the Arctic and includes scientists from 23 countries.
"In Arctic research, our ability to understand these rapid changes that are unfolding is like putting parts of the puzzle together -- and without Russia you're missing a big part of that picture," said Matthew Druckenmiller, the U.S. delegate to the IASC council and a geophysicist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.
The organizers acknowledged that barring researchers from Russian institutions and organizations would complicate research efforts. Monitoring in Russian territories and working with Russian experts are essential to fully understanding Arctic climate and the global consequences of changes in the region, Jorgen Berge and Geir Gotaas, chair and vice-chair, respectively, of the local organizing committee for the conference, said in an email. But the conflict required them to take action, they said.
"We are -- as ever -- strong supporters of scientific collaboration, but in the current situation the scientific benefits of maintaining official links with Russian institutions are outweighed by the need to take a clear stand against the actions of the Russian government," Drs. Berge and Gotaas said. Russian scientists from non-Russian organizations could still attend, they said.

Full text: Energy companies can now share traceable information about the emissions that were generated when their oil was produced thanks to a new platform provided by exchange operator Xpansiv, which is betting that corporate climate targets will stoke demand for fuel with a smaller carbon footprint.
Scandinavian oil producer Lundin Energy AB said Wednesday it would be the first company to use Xpansiv's platform to record emissions data for its crude.
Dubbed Digital Crude Oil, the platform ties each barrel of oil to an emissions profile based on data such as the energy consumption of the oil rig it came from. Xpansiv said it is in talks with other oil drillers about signing up, and wants to let them sell certificates based on their products' environmental performance.
Some energy producers are pitching their own emissions-reductions efforts as a selling point, in some cases even branding their fuel "carbon neutral." Such claims are hard to substantiate. Xpansiv, which operates various markets for sustainability-related financial products such as carbon offsets, says energy companies should be able to charge more if they can prove that their products cause less pollution than those of their peers.
The long-term objective is "to transform the energy sector at scale," said Jeff Cohen, Xpansiv's director of sustainability.
Emissions from the energy sector mostly occur when fuel is burned, but 15% arise when oil and gas are extracted and shipped, according to the International Energy Agency.
Xpansiv's oil product follows a similar service for sharing environmental data about natural gas, which it launched in September.

Full text: Koch Industries Inc., built on oil, has emerged as one of the biggest financial backers of the battery industry.
A Koch Industries unit has made at least 10 investments worth at least $750 million in the U.S. battery supply chain and electric vehicles in the past 18 months, regulatory filings, news releases and FactSet data show. Koch's battery investments are among the biggest from outside the auto industry, analysts say.
Koch's chief executive officer, Charles Koch, and his late brother, David, donated billions of dollars to conservative and libertarian political causes, including some that opposed environmental regulation and questioned whether climate change is a problem.
Founded more than 80 years ago as an oil refiner, Koch Industries is the most diversified U.S. battery investor, said Vivas Kumar, a former Tesla Inc. senior manager and industry analyst who last year launched a battery-parts startup. "It's stunning just how many different battery supply chain players they've taken a stake in," he said.
Koch Industries is now a top shareholder in startups such as Freyr Battery SA, Aspen Aerogels Inc. and Standard Lithium Ltd. The money comes at a crucial time for many of these companies, which need to spend heavily to commercialize their products. Koch appears to be focused on building up the battery industry in the U.S.
"The speed of the energy transition is directly correlated with companies like Koch participating in it," said Tom Jensen, CEO of Freyr, a Norway-based company working to make low-cost, sustainable batteries. Koch Industries has a 10% stake in Freyr, which was valued at about $120 million as of the end of last year, according to FactSet. The companies have a joint venture to make batteries in the U.S.
Koch Industries, based in Wichita, Kan., declined to comment about its battery investments. It has said little publicly about its battery strategy. The company has made the investments through Koch Strategic Platforms, a subsidiary of its investment group that it launched in late 2020 to invest in the energy transition, computing, automation and healthcare.
Koch Industries operates thousands of miles of pipelines that move oil and gas around the country and several large refineries. The company posts annual sales of about $120 billion through brands such as Brawny paper towels and Dixie cups, fertilizers and fabrics.
One of the groups they have backed, Americans for Prosperity, has fought efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon emissions. They have donated to the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the CO2 Coalition, both of which also supported former President Donald Trump's 2017 withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, argue against the benefits of electric vehicles and question whether global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels is a major issue.
In late 2020, Charles Koch, then 85 years old, wrote in a book that his partisanship was a mistake and said he hoped to address societal problems. His company's political-action committee has continued donating heavily to Republican candidates.
Koch Industries has targeted companies that aim to provide raw materials for batteries, including lithium producer Standard Lithium and battery recycling company Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. Most battery materials are produced overseas, often in China, and shortages have driven up prices.
The company has also backed startups out to make better batteries, such as Solid Power Inc., a maker of solid-state batteries that is backed by Ford Motor Co. and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG.
Koch has made the wagers through a combination of equity stakes and convertible debt that would become equity if share prices rise.
Shares of many of the companies have been volatile, with many clean-tech startups down recently on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, interest-rate increases and supply-chain disruptions swinging markets.
Short sellers, who wager on share-price declines, have bet against Standard Lithium, arguing that the company's technology doesn't work. Koch has said it conducted extensive due diligence before investing and is excited about Standard's potential. Standard has called the accusations false and misleading.
Some analysts expect Koch Industries' investments will spur others to follow them.
"When you see these large players jumping in the pool, you have to wonder, 'What do they see that I don't?'" said Chris Berry, founder of House Mountain Partners LLC, an adviser to battery-metals companies and investors.

Full text: Hundreds of companies have pledged to cut their carbon footprints to help limit climate change. Under new regulations proposed Monday, many of these companies will now have to disclose their emissions, including hard-to-measure data from their suppliers and customers.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said its sweeping plans are designed to allow investors to better compare the impact of climate change on companies.
But the greenhouse-gas data companies would have to disclose won't necessarily be on a like-for-like basis, the details of the SEC proposals show. And only some of the data will have to be verified independently, under the SEC's plans.
The landmark SEC proposals add a dense layer of climate reporting requirements to the existing bedrock of mandatory financial disclosures.
Companies would have to report on the greenhouse gases created by their operations and use of energy, known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Some larger companies would also have to disclose the carbon created by their supply chain and customers. These so-called Scope 3 emissions would have to be reported if they are part of a carbon-cutting target or information a typical shareholder would want to know.
The proposed rules allow companies to choose how they work out the Scope 3 emissions, as long as that methodology is disclosed. That flexibility eases the reporting burden on companies but could allow for some marked differences in approach.
Amazon.com Inc. reports voluntarily on its Scope 3 emissions, which form part of its 2040 net-zero target for greenhouse gas emissions.
The e-commerce giant counts in its Scope 3 the greenhouse gases from the manufacturing, use and disposal of its own-brand products, such as Kindle e-readers and Amazon Basics. These account for about 1% of sales, according to Amazon.
The company doesn't count the emissions from making, using or disposing of anything else it sells, such as products it buys from manufacturers or from products sold by third parties.
That is a different approach from some rival retailers. Target Corp. for example includes emissions from non-Target branded products it sells in stores and online, according to its climate disclosures.
An Amazon spokesman said in a statement that Amazon is an "online marketplace where many products sold are from third-party sellers, who control their own carbon emissions accounting." Amazon's emissions disclosures are verified by an independent third party and follow the guidance of a widely used standard known as the GHG protocol, the statement added.
Scope 3 emissions can be hard for companies to measure accurately or to control, according to some business groups and academics.
"The quality, provenance, methodologies and content of Scope 3 reporting leave a lot to be desired among even sophisticated companies, even in advanced economies such as in the U.S.," said Anant Sundaram, a finance professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business.
The SEC proposals give businesses protection against being taken to court for inaccurate Scope 3 disclosures, provided the information is reasonable and given in good faith.
The agency has also decided not to require Scope 3 numbers to be audited. That contrasts with the planned requirement for Scope 1 and 2 disclosures by larger companies to be verified independently. Hester Peirce, a Republican SEC commissioner who voted against the proposals, said this difference in approach reflected the flaws in Scope 3 data. "Nobody can credibly provide assurance for numbers that are inherently unreliable," she said.
Kristina Wyatt, a former SEC official, said the proposals would make it much easier for investors to compare companies' carbon footprints, even if different methodologies are used. "Maybe it's not entirely perfect, but it's certainly a huge leap forward from where we are right now," said Ms. Wyatt, deputy general counsel at Persefoni Inc., a carbon-accounting startup.
The SEC said Monday the current system of voluntary disclosure makes it hard for investors to compare carbon-cutting pledges. Two-thirds of S&P 500 companies by the end of last year had set a carbon target, up from less than half at the end of 2017, according to data provider Refinitiv. But many companies don't give investors enough information to judge if their commitments have substance or are likely to be met, the SEC said.
Despite mushrooming net-zero targets, carbon emissions at many big companies have gone up in recent years. Between 2015 and 2020, the combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased at 71 of 252, or more than a quarter, of the S&P 500 companies reporting these numbers, the latest Refinitv data show. Scope 3 emissions increased over the same period at 90 of the 154 companies reporting this data, according to Refinitiv.
Gary Gensler, the SEC chair, said Monday the agency isn't trying to push more companies into setting climate goals. "This is a disclosure rule," he told reporters. "Whether or not a company [has] a target . . . that's up to them."

Full text: Companies will likely face higher compliance costs and disclosure challenges stemming from a new proposal requiring firms to provide estimates of their greenhouse-gas emissions and risks to their businesses from climate change, finance chiefs said.
Many companies provide details on climate risks when disclosing information they deem material, but investors often find it hard to make comparisons. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday sought to remedy that by compelling companies to report greenhouse-gas emissions from their own operations as well as from the energy they consume, and to obtain independent certification of their estimates. The proposal will be open for public feedback for at least 60 days, after which the SEC will start crafting a final rule.
Office-products maker Acco Brands Corp. expects the potential additional disclosure will increase its costs, though not as much as the roughly $3 million it pays annually to comply with internal controls requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, said Chief Financial Officer Neal Fenwick. "The bottom line is we're going to need to spend a great deal of time, effort and money," Mr. Fenwick said.
The proposal would force the company to provide more details about its carbon emissions, which would involve better understanding where its electricity providers source their power from, Mr. Fenwick said. In some countries, that information isn't readily available, said Mr. Fenwick.
Companies will likely have to hire more people to assist with the work and tap an engineering or audit firm to attest to the accuracy of their estimates, said Julie Mediamolle, a partner at law firm Alston & Bird LLP who is focused on corporate governance and securities compliance.
Under the proposal, companies would be required to include independent assurance -- typically from a consulting or audit firm -- that the emissions details from their own operations and from electricity, steam, heating or cooling are accurate.
That assurance requirement adds a layer of complexity and expense that appears unnecessary, said Robert McMahon, CFO of laboratory-supply firm Agilent Technologies Inc. "Companies will do the right thing on data quality if they are putting that data in their [annual filings]," he said. Agilent said it will assess the potential costs as part of a broader review.
Under the proposal, companies must disclose Scope 3 emissions, which includes those from suppliers, only if they deem the output of greenhouse gases significant to investors or if they outline specific targets for them. Scope 3 emissions from companies' supply chain are particularly hard to measure.
Disclosure of Scope 3 emissions would have to be included in SEC filings starting in 2025 for large firms that meet the above criteria. Small public companies with less than $250 million in publicly traded shares would be exempt. Companies that would be required to disclose Scope 3 details wouldn't be held liable for the estimates if they were provided in good faith.
The proposal marks a step toward creating unified and organized policies and guidance for corporate climate disclosures, said Rachel Glaser, CFO at Etsy Inc. The Brooklyn, N.Y.-based online marketplace in recent years has voluntarily provided disclosure on three sets of emissions.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Regulators proposed stringent requirements for publicly traded companies to report information on greenhouse-gas emissions and risks related to climate change, in one of the Biden administration's potentially most significant environmental actions to date.
The Securities and Exchange Commission formally offered a 534-page proposal Monday that would force publicly traded companies to report greenhouse-gas emissions from their own operations as well as from the energy they consume and to obtain independent certification of their estimates.
In some cases, companies also would be required to report greenhouse-gas output of both their supply chains and consumers, known as Scope 3 emissions. An SEC official said most companies in the S&P 500 would likely have to report Scope 3 emissions. Companies would have to include the information in SEC filings such as annual reports.
The proposal comes as President Biden's efforts to address global warming through legislation have stalled in Congress, putting pressure on regulatory agencies to deliver on a core Democratic priority. That has drawn criticism from Republicans, who accused Democratic SEC Chairman Gary Gensler of overreach.
Mr. Gensler said investors and asset managers representing tens of trillions of dollars have called for companies' climate-related disclosures to be more standardized. While hundreds of companies have already begun reporting data about their carbon emissions and other climate-related metrics, SEC officials say current disclosures are inconsistent and hard for investors to compare.
"Companies and investors alike would benefit from the clear rules of the road proposed in this release," Mr. Gensler said.
Meredith Cross, a partner at corporate law firm WilmerHale and former SEC division director, said the proposed rule is "the most extensive, comprehensive and complicated disclosure initiative in decades."
SEC members voted 3-1 to issue the proposal, which will be open for public comment for at least two months before the agency will begin work on a final rule. Commissioners voted along party lines, with all three Democrats voting yes.
Republicans and some industry groups have been gearing up for months to fight the new requirements, which are a hallmark of Mr. Gensler's ambitious policy agenda. They say the proposed rules would increase compliance costs and go far beyond a strict interpretation of the SEC's mandate to protect investors by requiring disclosures relevant to companies' financial performance.
"Today's action hijacks the democratic process and disrespects the limited scope of authority that Congress gave to the SEC," Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said in an emailed statement. "This is a thinly veiled effort to have unelected financial regulators set climate and energy policy for America."
Democrats in Congress and members of the Biden administration touted the proposal as delivering on a promise of the president to address climate change.
"Investors and businesses have for years asked for reliable information that can be used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, adding that the rule will protect investors and make the financial system more resilient. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which Ms. Yellen leads, formally designated climate change an emerging and growing risk to U.S. financial stability last year.
SEC commissioners, staff and advisers spent months negotiating the contours of the proposal. Their challenge is to reconcile two conflicting goals: to make public as much information about climate change and associated risks as they can feasibly demand from companies, and to craft rules that withstand legal scrutiny in federal courts that have grown increasingly conservative.
A sticking point in the deliberations was the circumstances in which the SEC would mandate disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, which is typically much larger than a company's direct greenhouse-gas output. But companies struggle to accurately estimate the emissions from their suppliers, who may not offer their own calculations of greenhouse-gas output, or from customers who use their products and services.
The rules proposed Monday would allow companies a degree of flexibility. Disclosure of Scope 3 emissions would be mandatory only if output of those greenhouse gases is material, or significant to investors, or if companies outline specific targets for them.
For instance, if a company announces plans to reach "net-zero" emissions by a certain date, it would have to specify whether that goal includes all scopes of greenhouse-gas output. If so, disclosure of its Scope 3 emissions would have to be included in its SEC filings starting in 2025 for large firms. Companies wouldn't, however, be required to obtain independent assurance that their Scope 3 estimates are accurate and wouldn't be held liable for the estimates if they were provided in good faith.
Many regulators say the threats to companies from global warming fall into two buckets: First are the physical risks posed to a company's facilities and operations by the increased frequency of extreme weather events -- droughts, floods, wildfires and hurricanes -- in regions where such occurrences used to be rare. Second are "transition risks" resulting from efforts to wean the economy off fossil fuels and prepare for the effects of climate change.
Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce voted against the proposal and issued dissenting statement of 6,300-words -- not including footnotes.
"We are here laying the cornerstone of a new disclosure framework that will eventually rival our existing securities-disclosure framework in magnitude and cost, and probably outpace it in complexity," Ms. Peirce said. She warned that the proposed rules will enrich "the climate-industrial complex" while hurting investors, the economy and the SEC.

Full text: A company that can measure the carbon footprint of Parmesan shavings for a salad maker was valued at $1 billion by its investors last month.
Watershed Technology Inc. sells software that allows companies to quickly work out their environmental impact. That information is in high demand for investors and increasingly by regulators, creating a hot but already crowded market.
For Sweetgreen Inc., Watershed counts the greenhouse-gas emissions from salad ingredients like Parmesan. Cheese is one of Sweetgreen's most carbon-intensive ingredients but also one that is tough to measure. Its emissions depend in part on how the company's suppliers deal with their cow's manure.
Founded in 2019, Watershed is one of several startups vying to sell carbon-accounting software. The company and its competitors, which increasingly include tech giants, promise a faster, more accurate picture of a client's carbon footprint.
Supply chains often count for a large part of a company's emissions. Calculating that figure has been hard because it requires detailed information from dozens or hundreds of companies that could be spread across the world. The popular shortcut, says 29-year-old Watershed co-founder Taylor Francis, has been to rely on industry averages. The assumption is that one Parmesan maker is the same as every other, in terms of carbon emissions.
Mr. Francis says drilling down to specific numbers for each supplier means companies can identify the targets that will achieve the biggest cuts to emissions. "That's where the rubber meets the road," he says, before searching in vain for a greener turn of phrase.
The global market for carbon-accounting software is growing fast. The sector attracted $356 million of venture-capital funding last year, more than five times the $63 million total for 2020, according to research firm PitchBook Data Inc. This year, the funding has already reached $71.5 million, thanks mostly to $70 million raised by Watershed in February, the PitchBook data show.
"This is one of these new market areas that's being propelled by some very powerful fuel," said billionaire venture capitalist Michael Moritz. His firm, Sequoia Capital, co-led last month's $70 million financing round that put the unicorn tag on Watershed, which is based in San Francisco. Watershed further boosted its profile by hiring as an adviser former Canada and U.K. central-bank head Mark Carney, who has pushed the private sector to address climate change.
The rise in demand for carbon reporting reflects a change in attitudes toward climate information by investors. "Four years ago when I was pitching [my carbon-accounting idea] to investors, nobody had any idea what it was," said Maria Fujihara, co-founder of San Francisco-based Sinai Technologies Inc.
Regulators are increasingly asking about businesses' carbon emissions as well. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission plans to propose rules on greenhouse-gas emissions disclosures on Monday. In Japan, more than 1,800 companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange will soon be required to either disclose climate information or explain why they aren't doing so. Investors are also demanding climate data so they can judge whether companies are living up to their promises to cut emissions.
"The scale of the potential demand is mind boggling," said Kentaro Kawamori, co-founder of Tempe, Ariz.-based startup Persefoni Inc. Its clients include banks and private-equity firms, such as Bain Capital, that want to measure the emissions of companies they lend to or invest in.
The startups face increasing competition from leading tech companies. Salesforce.com Inc. for example last month rolled out the latest version of its "net zero cloud" software platform for tracking and analyzing climate data. Microsoft Corp. in October announced the soft launch of a competing product.
Carbon-accounting software typically plugs into a company's computer systems, so it can pull information such as details on goods purchased and electricity consumption. Each data point is converted into a greenhouse-gas tally using specialized emissions databases, such as those that measure the carbon output of a certain type of machine running for a set period.
A startup called CarbonChain, for example, has data on 135,000 ships that it can use to calculate the greenhouse gases from transporting goods by sea, according to co-founder Adam Hearne.
One advantage of using specialized software to crunch the carbon numbers is that the math is "multifold more complex" than for financial accounting, according to Persefoni's Mr. Kawamori. Business-travel emissions can, for example, be worked out based on the fuel consumed or the distance traveled, with the option to also allow for employees' nights on the road using a "hotel emission factor."
Some companies are concerned about the risk to their reputation if they are found to have understated their emissions, according to Adam Kramer, chief executive of startup nZero.
"There's an underlying belief in boardrooms that there's going to be a scandal about underreporting," Mr. Kramer said. He says his Reno, Nev.-based company's data on emissions by its clients can vary by more than 20% from their estimates.
The startups often pitch their emissions-accounting platform as just the starting point. Many of them also sell products to reduce that emissions tally, such as investments in forests, or other so-called offsets that companies can use to lower their reported carbon footprint. These income-boosting sales could create a conflict of interest -- the bigger the carbon total found by the startup, the greater the potential for sales of offsets.
Lauren Gifford, a climate researcher at the University of Arizona, said the startups seek to differentiate themselves by the story they tell about what they are doing. "But many times, they're all involved in the same offset projects," she added.
The carbon-accounting market will likely see a shakeout of firms as it matures, according to Mr. Moritz, the Watershed-backing venture capitalist. "It will resemble one of those David Attenborough specials," he said. "The slowest wildebeest gets picked off."

Full text: The deadly wildfires that scorched southeastern Australia in 2019 and 2020 triggered atmospheric changes miles high and thinned the ozone layer over large parts of the Southern Hemisphere for months, new research shows.
The research, published Thursday in the journal Science, suggests that wildfires pose a new threat to the ozone layer globally and that their effects on human health might be greater than previously recognized.
Ozone blankets the Earth in an invisible layer 9 to 18 miles above the ground, absorbing dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Radiation damages living cells, and research has linked a decrease in ozone levels to an uptick in the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts in people. A 10% drop in atmospheric ozone could lead to 304,500 additional skin-cancer cases globally, according to the World Health Organization.
Ultraviolet radiation exposure has been linked to developmental damage in amphibians and disruptions in the growth of plants.
The intense fire season during the "Black Summer" of 2019 and 2020 blasted moist smoke particles into the stratosphere, where they sparked chemical reactions that ate away at the ozone, according to the research.
"We noticed some unprecedented changes in the atmospheric composition," said study co-author Peter Bernath, an atmospheric chemist at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. "The new thing is that the smoke from the stratosphere causes these changes."
The new research corroborates and extends the work of another study, published earlier this month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
"Both of the papers point towards satellite measurements that show that atmospheric ozone is being affected by the wildfires," said Susan Solomon, an atmospheric chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the leader of the earlier study. That research calculated an overall drop in ozone levels of about 1% above the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere in March 2020. Dr. Solomon's team included Dr. Bernath.
Rising global temperatures and drier conditions are leading to more-frequent massive wildfires around the world, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific body convened by the United Nations. Scientists have used the emerging field of attribution science -- which uses rigorous mathematical tools to assess whether extreme weather events are influenced by climate change -- to show that climate change contributed to the severity of the Australia blazes during the "Black Summer."
The frequency of extreme wildfires will likely rise 30% by 2050, according to a report published in February by the U.N. Environment Programme. In the U.S., fire seasons are getting longer, and blazes are getting larger. Climate-related changes doubled the area burned in forest fires in the western U.S. between 1984 and 2015, according to a 2018 National Climate Assessment, which summarizes the state of climate science with a focus on the U.S.
For the Science study, Dr. Bernath and his colleagues used satellite data to track atmospheric ozone levels over the middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere from January to December of 2020. The levels began dropping in April but took eight months to recover fully, they found. The research team also measured an increase in ozone-destroying chlorine compounds during that time.
Though the ozone reduction seen in conjunction with the Australia wildfires was temporary, the researchers said large wildfires could pose a persistent threat to global ozone levels.

Full text: Republicans know it. The European left knows it. Joe Manchin knows it. Even some of the Beltway press knows it. Now let's see how long it takes Joe Biden to recognize that the Ukraine war has reset energy politics and that his climate agenda risks dooming his party this fall.
He certainly hasn't sussed it out yet. The Joe Biden who showed up Monday at his first in-person fundraiser as president sounded like a man in a time warp. "Let me begin by saying: [Climate change] is the existential threat to humanity," he opened, proceeding to recite an environmental agenda identical to the one he campaigned on. Ukraine got one mention, and only then as further reason why Americans (among other things) need to "weatherize homes and businesses."
His administration is similarly proceeding as if Vladimir Putin weren't exploiting his energy dominance to kill Ukrainians. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently announced a new pipeline review policy that will stop most projects. The White House continues its near-moratorium on new leases to drill on federal land and its block of Alaskan drilling. The president announced he'll attempt to impose his Green New Deal via executive order. The House Progressive Caucus this week offered ideas, calling on him to "declare a national climate emergency," and use it to ban "fossil fuel leases," and force companies to build renewables under the Defense Production Act.
Across the pond, things look exactly opposite. The Europeans have embraced the climate religion with a fervor to rival Bernie Sanders. Yet Mr. Putin's shocking violence in Ukraine -- his willingness to wield energy as a weapon -- sobered the Continent overnight. No one is giving up on renewables, but nobody is any longer pretending they are the basis of energy reliability or security. Fossil fuels will remain for decades a currency of global power, and Russia's invasion highlights the stupidity of being broke.
Germany's government is stockpiling coal and expediting terminals for liquefied natural gas. Europe is working to get more gas through pipelines from Norway and Azerbaijan. Poland plans new nuclear plants. The U.K. may restart onshore fracking and ramp up North Sea drilling. Norway plans to expand Arctic exploration.
Sen. Manchin gets the shift, and this week he deep-sixed Mr. Biden's nominee to the Federal Reserve, the anti-fossil-fuel Sarah Bloom Raskin, saying that at this "historic moment" the U.S. needs policy leaders focused on the most pressing issues -- "specifically rising inflation and energy costs." Republicans are flooding the zone with ideas to accelerate fossil-fuel production, and even the pro-Biden media is beginning to fret about the president's failure to see what's happening.
While European leaders and Republicans are moving to address substantive geopolitical shifts, they also understand the politics. Gasoline and heating prices have been fleecing consumer wallets since Mr. Biden took office. He can try to lay off the more recent rise on "Putin's price hike," but polls consistently show voters blame high energy prices and inflation on the administration.
The inconvenient truth is that Mr. Biden's climate agenda -- no matter how much the liberal press wants to differ -- has never been popular. It's a concoction of the party's progressive left and radical activist groups. A recent survey from Democratic pollster Impact Research of likely voters in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Arizona (three states with Senate races this year) found that 78% had a favorable view of natural gas, and only 22% want an energy policy that looks like the Green New Deal.
And voters aren't buying Mr. Biden's argument that the response to Russia should be to double down on his climate visions. In a HarrisX poll this week, nearly 70% of voters said "yes" to the question of whether, in light of Russia's attack, the administration should "ease its focus on climate change and allow more oil and natural gas exploration." They want energy and economic security, not electric-car charging stations.
The other risk to Democrats sticking their heads in the non-tar sands is that they make the situation worse substantively as well as politically. Desperate to remain on climate autopilot, Mr. Biden and other Democrats are now trying to blame higher prices on Big Oil and Big Gas and debating a windfall profits tax -- a move that would depress production and further raise prices. Democratic governors are clamoring for a federal gasoline-tax holiday, but it's a gimmick that would only temporarily mask true prices, and may not count for much in any event.
Which gets to the heart of the problem. Democrats want to make the problem go away without addressing its roots. Russia's invasion has forced energy security to the center of the political debate, where it is likely to stay through the midterms. Voters will cast ballots for candidates who prove they understand the problem and have a plan for fixing it. Democrats who continue to wallow in platitudes about an "existential" climate crisis may find themselves out of jobs.

Full text: The Biden administration can move forward on policies that incorporate an increased estimate of the cost of climate change, a panel of judges ruled late Wednesday, reversing a decision by a federal judge last month.
The ruling marks the latest development in the Biden administration's attempt to adopt a more than sevenfold increase in a metric called the social cost of carbon, which assigns a dollar value to the harm caused by greenhouse-gas emissions.
In an eight-page decision, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that federal agencies would be harmed if they were prevented from using the interim estimates in the rules that the Environmental Protection Agency, the Transportation Department and other federal agencies are developing on climate-related issues. Those interim estimates were released in February 2021.
The decision reverses a Feb. 11 ruling from U.S. District Judge James D. Cain in Lake Charles, La., who had sided with 10 states with Republican attorneys general that sued the Biden administration over the interim estimates.
The states, in their lawsuit, said the Biden administration's metric will "entail a massive expansion of the federal government's regulatory power and justify unprecedented increases in regulatory restrictions on agriculture, energy, and virtually every other human activity."
Judge Cain granted the states a preliminary injunction blocking use of the proposed increase, while the lawsuit unfolds.
The metric is used in guiding a variety of government decisions, including the sale of energy leases on federal lands. The Biden administration moved last year to tentatively raise the value to $51 a metric ton, up from $7 a metric ton under the Trump administration. The administration was expected to finalize the value later this year.
The appeals court judges said that the federal government was likely to win the case once it fully plays out in the courts and that halting the use of the metric would cause irreparable harm. The appeals court's ruling also said that the 10 states that sued lack the status to do so because the injury they face -- "increased regulatory burdens" -- is hypothetical.
A spokesman for Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said the state will ask a wider panel of judges to reconsider.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- One of the three Democrats on the Securities and Exchange Commission, Allison Lee, said Tuesday that she intends to depart the agency once a successor has been confirmed by the Senate.
Ms. Lee, a former SEC enforcement attorney who was sworn in as a commissioner in 2019, would be eligible to continue serving for about 18 months after her term ends in June. But she has privately signaled that she didn't intend to stretch her term or seek reappointment, people familiar with her plans say.
The five-seat SEC currently comprises three Democrats, including Chairman Gary Gensler, and one Republican, with a vacancy for a GOP nominee that has remained open since Elad Roisman stepped down as commissioner at the end of January.
But the agency has a quorum rule that requires at least three commissioners to agree to vote on regulatory or enforcement actions. That means that if the Democrats' majority were to shrink to 2-1, the lone Republican could effectively block rule proposals from coming to a vote.
Ms. Lee's plan to stick around until a replacement has been nominated and confirmed should allow Mr. Gensler's agenda to continue apace.
"Over the coming weeks and months, I will remain actively engaged in the Commission's critically important work, and I look forward to continued progress in advancing the Commission's regulatory agenda," Ms. Lee said in a statement.
As a commissioner, Ms. Lee has pushed the SEC to expand its oversight of private markets and use its authority to heighten companies' responsibilities around environmental, social and governance issues.
During a three-month stint as acting SEC chair following President Biden's swearing-in, she issued a request for comment from market participants about increasing companies' disclosure requirements around climate change and related risks. The thousands of comment letters that have poured into the agency over the ensuing year and a half gave Mr. Gensler a head start in crafting a climate-disclosure rule that the SEC plans to propose next week.
In a speech last July, Mr. Gensler noted that three-fourths of the unique letters the agency received in response to Ms. Lee's request for comment supported mandatory disclosures around climate change and related risks.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A key Democrat came out against Sarah Bloom Raskin's nomination to become the Federal Reserve's top banking regulator, likely dashing her chances of confirmation.
Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a pivotal vote for Democrats in the 50-50 Senate, said Monday that he couldn't support Ms. Raskin's nomination, citing her views on addressing climate change.
Democrats now would need the support of at least one Republican to confirm her, though no Senate Republicans have so far signaled they would back her.
"Unless there is a white knight hiding somewhere in the Republican caucus, it looks like Raskin's nomination is effectively toast," said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at brokerage firm BTIG.
For weeks, Ms. Raskin's nomination to become the Fed's vice chairwoman for banking supervision has been stuck in the Senate Banking Committee after Republicans opposing her refused to attend a crucial committee vote. The move deprived Democrats of a quorum needed to advance her to the full Senate along with President Biden's four other Fed picks -- including Chairman Jerome Powell, who has been nominated for a second term leading the central bank.
Mr. Biden, a Democrat, nominated Ms. Raskin in January for the Fed post, a position created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul. It is responsible for developing policy recommendations for the Fed board and also oversees the Fed's regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.
Republicans, especially from energy-producing states such as Pennsylvania and Wyoming, oppose Ms. Raskin in part because of her 2020 criticism of the Treasury Department and Fed providing broad-based emergency-lending backstops to assist businesses during the pandemic. She said the backstops should have been designed to avoid lending to highly indebted fossil-fuel companies.
In a statement, Mr. Manchin, who represents a coal-producing state, indicated he shared those concerns. "Her previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation's critical energy needs," Mr. Manchin said.
The chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Mr. Manchin has in recent weeks championed efforts to increase U.S. energy production. He has criticized reliance on foreign energy sources after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, introducing legislation to ban imports of Russian oil -- a step the Biden administration eventually took.
A White House official said the administration was still working to line up bipartisan support for Ms. Raskin, saying she had been the target of an "unprecedented, baseless campaign led by oil-and-gas companies that sought to tarnish her distinguished career."
Ms. Raskin didn't reply to a request to comment.
Republican lawmakers also said recently that they wanted more information about Ms. Raskin's work as a board member at an obscure financial technology payments firm, Reserve Trust. The GOP officials, led by Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, said they were perturbed by what they perceived as insufficient candor about her role as a director at the company.
Ms. Raskin engaged in extensive back and forth with senators, including one-on-one meetings, and responded to nearly 200 questions after her Feb. 3 hearing, White House officials have said.
She previously served on the Fed and as a top Treasury Department official during the Obama administration. Before that, she was Maryland's state commissioner of financial regulation. She is a law professor at Duke University and is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.).
Mr. Manchin has proved to be a roadblock for many of the Biden administration's goals. He opposed Mr. Biden's first nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget. The White House pulled the nomination after some Republicans said they would also oppose her.
Mr. Manchin scuttled the White House's hopes of advancing a $2 trillion healthcare, climate and education package, which the party is still trying to revive.
The Biden administration has struggled to advance its nominees for top financial posts through the Senate. Saule Omarova, an academic tapped for a separate job overseeing large national banks, withdrew from consideration in December, amid objections from both Republicans and some Democrats.
It isn't known whom Mr. Biden might nominate in Ms. Raskin's place if she withdraws.
In a statement, Mr. Toomey said GOP lawmakers are willing to meet to vote on the four other Fed nominees, including Mr. Powell. In an earlier interview on Monday on Bloomberg News, Mr. Toomey said he wasn't aware of any GOP lawmakers who would support Ms. Raskin, though he said he hadn't discussed the matter with every Senate Republican.
Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), chairman of the Banking Committee, said through a spokeswoman that he was still working to advance Ms. Raskin's nomination on a bipartisan basis.
The Biden administration had previously eyed former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray to become Fed vice chairman of supervision. It might be tricky for the White House to find candidates who can please progressives in the Democratic Party, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- who supported Ms. Omarova and Ms. Raskin -- and also please centrists who objected to them.
The impasse comes amid philosophical divides between some progressive Democrats, who want the central bank to play a more aggressive role addressing climate change, and Republicans who fear the Fed is straying beyond its job of ensuring low inflation, low unemployment and a stable banking system.
Ms. Raskin's difficulties also illustrate how nominations for the central bank have become more polarized. When she was nominated for Fed governor in 2010, she faced no opposition.
Delays in filling top Fed roles have slowed decisions on regulatory policy.
The issues include a potential tweak to how the Fed counts deposits held at the central bank toward banks' leverage ratio. The Fed allowed a temporary, pandemic-related reprieve from the capital requirements to expire last spring, but it said it would consider an overhaul to the rule's treatment of ultrasafe assets.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to propose rules mandating disclosure from publicly traded companies about climate change and associated risks in a meeting on March 21, the agency said.
The climate-change rules are among the most ambitious and closely watched items on SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's agenda. They are likely to require companies to report more standardized information about their greenhouse-gas emissions as well as climate-related risks they face now and in the future, Mr. Gensler has said.
Such vulnerabilities might include the potential for physical damage to companies' operations from floods, wildfires or extreme weather events and potential new regulations designed to curb global warming.
Companies are currently required to report risks they consider material, or likely to be important in the eyes of a reasonable investor, including those stemming from climate change. Mr. Gensler, who was nominated by President Biden, has said such disclosures vary from firm to firm and are of limited use to investors.
If a majority of the SEC's four commissioners vote to advance the proposal, the agency will take comments from the public, likely for at least 60 days, before moving to finalize a rule. The commission comprises three Democrats -- all of whom have advocated for a climate-change rule -- and one Republican, who has expressed skepticism.
Republican lawmakers have sought to discourage the SEC from pursuing enhanced reporting around climate change, saying the agency is stretching its mandates to protect investors and facilitate access to capital for growing companies.
Energy and transportation companies have been preparing to fight the new rules.

Full text: Private-equity firm TPG Inc.'s impact arm is investing in a renewable-natural-gas producer set up by pork processor Smithfield Foods Inc., betting the business can benefit from increased demand for alternative fuels.
Monarch Bioenergy LLC operates anaerobic-digestion plants that convert methane emissions from hog manure into natural gas at Smithfield farms in Missouri. Smithfield formed the St. Louis business in 2018 with Roeslein Alternative Energy LLC, a developer of anaerobic digesters. Such systems use microorganisms to turn organic matter into natural gas and nutrient-rich byproducts such as fertilizer feedstocks.
Following the investment in Monarch through its TPG Rise Climate strategy, the private-equity firm, Smithfield and Roeslein each own a third of the joint venture, according to a news release. TPG didn't disclose the size of the deal.
TPG's Rise Climate strategy backs businesses that help mitigate climate change and is part of TPG's Rise impact-investing arm. Impact investments seek to combine financial returns with benefits to communities and the environment.
Such strategies have become popular among investors. Impact fund managers world-wide raised $10.6 billion across 46 such vehicles last year, 19% more than the $8.93 billion they collected for 38 funds a year earlier, according to data provider Preqin Ltd.
TPG has raised at least $6.8 billion for the TPG Rise Climate LP fund from 167 investors, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Feb. 18. The firm had set a $7 billion limit for the fund, WSJ Pro Private Equity reported last year.
"We saw a meaningful opportunity to reduce greenhouse gases through two pathways," Marc Mezvinsky, a business-unit partner at TPG Rise, said of the Monarch deal.
"The first is methane capture and abatement from swine manure," Mr. Mezvinsky said. "The second is the production of renewable natural gas that will reduce the use of high carbon-intensity natural gas."
Monarch plans to use the new capital to build more plants and expand its agricultural-sector services to other states, such as Colorado and Oklahoma. The company also expects to produce natural gas from prairie grass, having planted several thousand acres alongside Roeslein, according to the news release.
The idea, Mr. Mezvinsky said, is to use soil nutrients generated through anaerobic digestion to fertilize acres of prairie. The grasses and other plants in turn help remove carbon dioxide from the air and become feedstock for the production of more natural gas.
"We believe the technology has the potential to create this kind of closed-loop system in farms across the U.S.," Mr. Mezvinsky said.
Global consumption of biogas could reach the equivalent of 75 million metric tons of crude oil by 2040, more than double its levels in 2018, boosted by low-cost feedstocks and supportive policies, according to the International Energy Agency.
Monarch expects to benefit from an expanding U.S. renewable-fuel market and from government programs that provide incentives for using renewable natural gas, Mr. Mezvinsky said.
In addition to gas sales, a significant portion of Monarch's revenue comes from carbon credits that the company obtains through incentive programs and sells to businesses seeking to offset their carbon emissions, Mr. Mezvinsky said. The programs are critical for the company's expansion, he added.
"The renewable-fuel market has been built upon a regulatory framework and that's not lost on us," Mr. Mezvinsky said regarding the company's reliance on programs that can lapse. "We spent a lot of time considering that risk and are comfortable with it [as we] believe that across administrations there's been full support for these new technologies."

Full text: A line to share solar power between the deserts of northwest India and Oman, more than 600 miles west, could be the first step in an electricity network that might one day span the globe.
The second leg would go a couple thousand miles east, from India through Bangladesh, Myanmar and Vietnam. A few more links between already existing energy grids in the Middle East, Europe and Africa could produce a network that stretches across 10 time zones, powering one part of the world with juice from another, says Jagjeet Sareen, assistant director general at the International Solar Alliance in Delhi, which is spearheading the project. The goal is to get the entire network linked up by 2050.
"The sun never sets practically, you know -- it's setting here, rising somewhere else," Mr. Sareen says. "If we could connect, voila! You would have green electricity everywhere."
Such is the promise of transnational supergrids -- the vision of globe-girdling power networks that could ship electricity, particularly renewable energy, from areas where it can be produced in abundance to wherever it is needed -- across continents, weather systems and oceans.
The grand idea has been around for decades -- and has always run up against daunting technical, economic and political barriers. Even now, turbulence around Ukraine has quickly changed the energy landscape, highlighting the huge challenges of such transnational efforts.
Among efforts that never got off the ground: In the mid-2000s, officials in Germany and Jordan pitched a plan that would power Europe with solar energy collected in the Sahara. In 2011, Japanese billionaire and SoftBank Group Corp. CEO Masayoshi Son proposed an Asian supergrid that would funnel renewable energy from Mongolia, through China, South Korea and Japan. One of the most ambitious proposals came from China's state utility, State Grid Corp., whose former chairman Liu Zhenya in 2016 unveiled a plan to pull power from solar and wind installations in the arctic and at the equator, and send it around the world in ultra-high-voltage cables. The estimated price tag: $50 trillion.
Nevertheless, many energy experts argue supergrids' time is coming, driven by technological advancement, declining costs and the growing determination of governments to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
"We need the supergrids both to deliver the bulk clean energy but also to make sure it's cheap," says Nicholas Dunlop, secretary-general of the Climate Parliament, a network of legislators focused on climate change that has long championed its own Green Grids Initiative for transnational renewable power. At the November Glasgow climate summit, that U.K.-backed initiative joined with the India-led ISA project to become the Green Grids Initiative-One Sun One World One Grid. Their ultimate aim is to create a network to connect the power markets of 120-plus countries.
Around 90 countries have endorsed the project, the World Bank has signed on as a partner and French electricity supplier Electricite de France SA, or EDF, is studying how best to put it in place. If regulators, governments and development banks like the World Bank can be persuaded to underwrite the risks of various legs of the project -- each of which could cost billions of dollars when the price of adding renewable-energy installations is included -- private financiers will jump in, ISA's Mr. Sareen says.
Cross-border power trading in relatively small quantities is common now -- between the U.S. and Canada, for instance, or within Europe. But the prospect of supersizing such linked grids is becoming more important, those in the industry say, because it could help mitigate the capriciousness of power sources dependent on the weather.
A grid that stretches past local weather systems could potentially ship electricity to areas whose supply has been hit by disasters. It could absorb surplus energy from a region with lots of wind farms on gusty days, for instance -- and tap the greater network to supply that region with electricity when turbines are becalmed.
"I see long-distance electrical transmission as part of the energy-storage system," says Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning Stanford University physicist and former U.S. secretary of energy who has long championed transnational grids.
The ability to send electricity long distances is also important for tapping resources in the often-remote areas where renewable energy is best produced -- like uninhabited, windy plains that can host acres of windmills or scorching deserts that can be sites for solar panels.
In the past, shipping electricity many hundreds of miles over conventional alternating-current lines wasn't economical because of power losses that mounted rapidly the longer the distance. But improvements in the technology, hardware and cost needed for ultra-high-voltage direct-current lines, where losses are radically lower, have made transcontinental power shipment much more economical than in the past, industry experts say.
At the end of 2018, China's State Grid announced it had powered up a 1,100-kilovolt, 2,000-mile line running diagonally across the country.
Long-distance undersea cables are trickier and more expensive. The cables must be insulated, and no materials exist that can handle the heat from the highest-voltage lines, transmission experts say. That means developers have to make do with lower-voltage cables and larger power losses.
Some are taking the plunge anyway. Australia- and Singapore-based Sun Cable has proposed a 2,600-mile undersea line that would ship solar power from northern Australia to Singapore; U.K.-based Xlinks Limited is planning a line nearly as long to ship power to the U.K. from Morocco. Both companies are private, and say they plan to raise money largely from private investors.
Politics remains a huge obstacle to cross-continental power. Governments would need to agree how to pay for and manage any long-distance electric lines or new connections between their current grids -- topics that run up against vested interests.
"People get very nervous about their supply of electricity" because you can't effectively store large quantities of it, so any disruptions hit the local grid immediately, says Mr. Chu. "It's in a totally different realm than the supply of oil or the supply of natural gas."
Today's supergrid planners, who have learned from years of stalled ideas, make the case for building large networks by using what already exists. Many of South Asia's power grids are linked together already; ditto the Gulf nations of the Middle East; and Africa has several regional networks, says Philippe Lienhart, an expert on power grids at EDF who is leading the interconnection study for the project formed at the Glasgow summit.
By adding lines between regions, you could potentially patch together something very big, he says.
It's also important to look at the path of least resistance. Take the power line between India and Oman. There are two ways to link the countries: a largely overland route through Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, and a route straight across the Arabian Sea.
The land route is much less costly, says ISA's Mr. Sareen. "But you won't find a single expert -- technical or non-technical -- telling us that it is doable." Supergrids will have to start, he says, where "political will is the strongest."

Backed by the world's central banks, this new currency is deployed around the globe to pay fossil-fuel companies and petrostates to leave their reserves in the ground. It's also used to reward businesses and individuals for sequestering carbon. By the end of Mr. Robinson's book, the global economy is largely run on carbon coins, with projects around the world rapidly drawing carbon out of the atmosphere.
Mr. Robinson didn't cook up the carbon-coin idea. It's the brainchild of Australian civil engineer Delton Chen. He's the founder of the Global Carbon Reward initiative, which aims to create financial incentives to drive down carbon emissions.
While ambitious, the carbon-coin scheme remains far from seeing the light of day and would face fierce opposition from both the political and financial realms. In Mr. Robinson's book, for instance, U.S. Federal Reserve officials express fears that the carbon coin could threaten the stability of the dollar, the world's reserve currency.
Mr. Chen said that shouldn't be a problem as the carbon currency, as he envisions it, couldn't be used as a medium of exchange.
We recently caught up with Mr. Chen to ask him how would work.
WSJ: Most people are familiar with the idea of a carbon tax, which penalizes companies for consuming fossil fuels. Your idea, a carbon currency that provides rewards for cutting carbon emissions or removing carbon from the atmosphere, is the reverse -- a carrot instead of a stick.
A: The carbon currency is a new kind of carrot, and it's the tool for what's called a global carbon reward. It's different from other carbon-pricing systems that economists have recommended. A "reward" is different from a typical subsidy, because the value of the reward will be managed with monetary policies [controlled by central banks]. Subsidies are managed with fiscal policies.
The great advantage of shifting to a monetary policy is that it has the potential to resolve a wide collection of very nasty socioeconomic problems, including the climate finance gap and the lack of international cooperation.
From the perspective of businesses, the carbon currency will be a debt-free revenue source with a predictable value, but it will also require that each business that wants to earn the carbon currency must accept a long-term service-level agreement. The service-level agreement will ensure that one unit of the carbon currency is issued for one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent that has been mitigated for the long term, such as a 100-year duration.
WSJ: How would the carbon currency be funded?
A: A very important distinction is that the carbon currency will not create any direct costs for governments, businesses or citizens. The costs will be covered by a globally coordinated central-bank guarantee. This guarantee will trigger private currency trading and investing in the carbon currency.
WSJ: What are some specific examples of actions people or companies can take that will earn rewards?
A: First, by producing cleaner energy commodities. Second, by developing cleaner business models. Third, by removing carbon from the atmosphere.
The reward rules will be designed to encourage large energy companies and state-owned enterprises to decarbonize at the maximum rate that is technically feasible, and well ahead of the market demand for new clean energy.
One hypothetical example is a multinational energy company that decides to switch to 100% renewable energy production and to retire its fossil energy reserves -- for earning the reward.
WSJ: Outside energy, what other economic sectors could take advantage of the carbon currency?
A: Reward rules can be developed for all sectors, including for small and medium-size businesses, and households -- as long as the mitigation outcome is significant.
WSJ: Many companies -- and countries -- have already made pledges to reduce their carbon emissions to net zero in the next few decades. Would a carbon currency help accelerate the process?
A: Ideally, the value of the carbon currency will be calibrated to explicitly meet the Paris goals. In this way, the carbon currency can accelerate and guide the transition to global net zero.
There are two inherent limitations of existing pledges. The first problem is that these pledges might not be backed by actionable plans and financial capital. The second problem is that for the companies and countries that set themselves very ambitious pledges, their motivation to reach those targets is compromised by other companies and countries that are continuing to benefit from the consumption of fossil fuels. This is sometimes described as the prisoner's dilemma.
WSJ: Do you see any downsides to the policy or hurdles to putting it in place?
A: I don't see any significant downside.
The main hurdle for advancing this policy is simply to find financial sponsorship to undertake the economic analysis and to complete a carbon-currency demonstration. When the policy is eventually examined by governments, I think many people will sit up and take notice because we are facing major systemic risks and we need a globally coordinated response.
WSJ: When did the idea for the carbon reward come to you? You're a civil engineer, not an economist.
A: I became curious about carbon pricing in late 2013. Back then I viewed the carbon-currency idea as having several useful attributes, but at that time I had no training in economics. So not surprising that it took me nearly eight years to develop the Global Carbon Reward policy. My goal was -- and still is -- to resolve every conundrum in climate change economics with an interdisciplinary theory that's compatible with neoclassical economics. I'm looking for a theory that's consistent with sociology, ecology, biology, chemistry and physics. I think that I may have cracked this problem.

Full text: Climate scientists in the Arctic often conduct their fieldwork without input from the region's Indigenous residents, some 1.13 million people including the Inuit in Alaska, Canada and Greenland and the Sami in Finland, Sweden and Norway.
But a shift in thinking in scientific circles and in the agencies that guide and fund scientific research -- including the National Science Foundation and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy -- augurs a new era of collaboration between the region's first residents and the researchers studying climatic and environmental changes now occurring at the top of the world.
Members of both camps predict such collaborations in the Arctic and elsewhere could let scientists tap into generations of accumulated regional knowledge about the climate that otherwise would have been missed while according a new measure of respect to Indigenous peoples.
"More and more people recognize that, wow, I'm basically coming into somebody else's backyard," says Andy Mahoney, a University of Alaska, Fairbanks, geophysicist who has studied Arctic sea ice in collaboration with residents of the Native Village of Kotzebue in northwest Alaska. "This is not how you behave in someone else's backyard. Let's try and do a better job."
As part of the "Ice Bridges" project, Dr. Mahoney and other scientists from the University of Alaska and several other institutions spent five years working in tandem with the residents to complete the first survey of sea ice in Kotzebue Sound. Shrinking winter sea ice in recent years has imperiled seal habitats and upended the long tradition of seal hunts that sustain the village, one of 574 tribes the U.S. recognizes as a sovereign government. Tribal leadership approved the project before the scientists began their work.
When the scientists began ice observations in 2018, drilling ice cores and scanning the sound with aerial drones, they learned from village elders that the sea ice that year was thinner than at any other point in the past seven decades. "That critical insight that pointed out just how significant that event was -- we would have missed that," Dr. Mahoney says. The ice in 2019 was even thinner.
The research traced the growing loss of sea ice to warm ocean water under the ice and warmer air temperatures. The work also showed that water was inundating ringed seal lairs that help keep seal pups dry and warm.
To learn more about the Kotzebue project and how it could inform research efforts elsewhere in the Arctic, we spoke with Dr. Mahoney and Bobby Schaeffer, one of four members of the research team's Indigenous Elders Advisory Council who advised the researchers.
WSJ: What makes Indigenous knowledge so helpful to scientists doing field work in the Arctic?
Mr. Schaeffer: The important part is the historical knowledge that we have. We have 16 different ways in our language of describing ice based on our experience of living up here for thousands of years. We know the condition of the ice when we're out there. We know the animals and how they relate to the ice. And especially during critical times when ice conditions are bad, we always look at how it could affect them because they are an important part of our way of life.
WSJ: Do you think collaboration between scientists and Indigenous people will transform the way climate research is conducted in the Arctic?
Mr. Schaeffer: It's hard to tell because we've been left out of research for so many years. Folks down south -- especially the scientific community -- like to do things on their own. They come up here, study something and then go back down and do their paper. We hear about it later on. I hope that in the future that the scientific community includes us.
Dr. Mahoney: The Indigenous voice has been missing from a lot of the research that's been done. As a result, communities have been overlooked in terms of how climate change impacts them. I think we're going to get better science and better representation and equality of the communities in the Arctic where we work.
WSJ: What needs to change to ensure productive collaborations between scientists and Indigenous people?
Mr. Schaeffer: It all depends on Native leadership. It's up to us to demand that we be part of it because we could provide some real positive input into whatever they're doing. You get the human aspect of our experiences with the problems we're having up here with global warming.
Dr. Mahoney: There needs to be a broad cultural shift. There needs to be a mechanism that allows individuals that represent their communities to participate in the science steering process. A concrete way of doing that would be to have Indigenous members on the committees that design those invitations at the level of the National Science Foundation. Then there are some of my colleagues who remain uncertain as to the value of Indigenous knowledge, or just how to use Indigenous knowledge. That's some education and awareness I've only been able to get through direct experience. All of these steps are in progress at the moment. We are seeing a change. I think there's still quite a lot of work to be done.
WSJ: What challenges might get in the way of future collaborations?
Dr. Mahoney: Some communities are seeing and experiencing research fatigue, because there are just too many scientists coming in and trying to work with elders. There are only so many Bobbys in any given community, and Bobby can't spend all of his time talking to scientists. It's not feasible unless we somehow improve the capacity of communities to respond to a sudden increase in the number of scientists.
Communities in Canada I know have declared a moratorium on research for some period of time, saying "We don't want to let any more researchers in until we've had time to come up with our research priorities." Some communities in Alaska wrote and said they don't want to see the big influx of scientists unless they're involved in the design and selection of those research projects.
WSJ: Will you collaborate on more research in the future?
Mr. Schaeffer: I'll be involved. I'll do what I can to convince the world that we do have a problem. I think we all want to do that.
WSJ: What did you learn from the Kotzebue project that might be implemented elsewhere?
Dr. Mahoney: What I've learned on the Ice Bridges project is bleeding over into all of my other research. In particular a project in northern Alaska, where we're looking at the lagoon system along the northern coast of Alaska, we're establishing an Indigenous advisory council for that project as well.

Full text: Can the ocean help save the planet?
Covering 70% of the Earth's surface, the ocean already acts as a giant carbon sink, removing about a quarter of the carbon dioxide produced each year by human activity, scientists estimate. Atmospheric carbon is absorbed through the physical mixing of air and water at the surface and with chemical reactions below that involve photosynthesis by marine plankton. Once the carbon enters the ocean, it can be safely locked up in the deep sea for hundreds or thousands of years, research has shown.
Scientists say it may not be enough to switch to renewable energy, drive electric vehicles and move to low-carbon manufacturing to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. To meet international climate goals, it's also necessary to remove 10 gigatons of atmospheric CO2 every year between now and 2050, according to a 2019 report by the National Academy of Sciences.
Some strategies are already under way, such as technologies aimed at sucking carbon dioxide directly from the air, agricultural techniques for storing carbon in soils, and changes in how forests are managed. Now, some researchers are looking at how the ocean could soak up additional carbon -- and what the benefits and risks would be.
"We seriously need to figure out how to remove some CO2, and it's already becoming pretty clear that you can't do it all on land," says David Keller, a senior scientist at the Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel in Germany. "The ocean plays a major role in the carbon cycle, and that's where most of the carbon is stored anyway. I think it just makes natural sense to look there. Of course, we don't want to mess up the ocean."
Ideas for ocean-aided carbon removal include dumping tons of iron filings in the ocean as a nutrient to promote plankton growth -- something that has been done more than a dozen times on a small scale. Other proposals involve building huge offshore kelp farms or restoring coastal ecosystems.
Whether such techniques can be effective and safe, especially on a large scale, remains to be seen. Scientists and entrepreneurs say ocean carbon removal needs more research as well as a sustainable economic model.
Experts convened in 2021 by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine identified six ocean carbon removal technologies that might make a dent in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The report recommended a $125 million research program to better understand the challenges, including potential economic and social effects, and estimated it would take $1.3 billion to translate these ideas into scalable demonstration projects.
Meanwhile, some entrepreneurs have already been testing their own ideas for employing the ocean to remove carbon. Here's a sampling:
Ocean Antacids
San Francisco-based Project Vesta says it is readying an experiment on a Caribbean island later this year to add a carbon-absorbing mineral to seawater to act as a kind of massive antacid tablet. Boosting alkalinity causes a series of chemical reactions that convert dissolved CO2 in the seawater into stable bicarbonate and carbonate molecules, which in turn causes the ocean to absorb more CO2 from the air.
Project Vesta plans to grind a green mineral called olivine into sand-like particles and spread it along the beach of a cove on the island, which it declined to name. As waves and currents dissolve the olivine, it is expected to create a series of chemical reactions that allow the ocean to capture CO2 from the air. A second bay on the island will serve as a control site. "We do change the ocean chemistry, but we do it in a very gradual way," Project Vesta CEO Tom Green says.
Meanwhile, Canadian startup Planetary Technologies plans to use nickel-mine waste, or tailings, to make an alkaline material that can be added to the ocean. The tailings are used in a process with electrical current to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and produce a byproduct called mineral hydroxide. Added to seawater, the hydroxide raises the alkalinity and captures more CO2 from the air, the firm says. The idea is to add the compound to existing industrial outfalls that lead to the ocean.
Researchers led by Geomar devised an experiment using large clear cylinders to measure how adding various alkaline minerals to seawater helps reduce CO2. The first phase took place off the coast of Grand Canary Island in the fall. The second part is planned for May in a Norwegian fjord. Early results show that the ocean chemistry must be carefully monitored to make sure the carbon is properly absorbed. If the alkalinity gets too high, a chemical precipitate forms, which can be toxic to ocean plankton.
Floating Kelp Farm
Aquaculture startup Running Tide proposes a flotilla of basketball-size buoys that support fronds of the macroalgae kelp underneath. As the kelp grows, it would absorb CO2 from the ocean. Once the kelp plant gets too big and heavy, it would sink to the bottom, dragging with it the carbon it has absorbed.
"It just hits the mud and then some of it gets eaten, becomes part of the ecosystem down there," says Running Tide CEO Marty Odlin, a former commercial fisherman who has an engineering degree from Dartmouth.
The recent National Academies study notes that too much decomposing kelp on the seafloor could cause "dead zones" of low-oxygen water that could harm marine life, while too much floating kelp could rob the surface layer of nutrients that supply other marine organisms.
Carbon Burial at Sea
What if you could grab CO2 from the air and bury it in the volcanic rock beneath the seafloor? That's the idea behind Solid Carbon, a Victoria, B.C.-based consortium that includes U.S. and Canadian scientists.
Floating platforms equipped with direct air capture machines would pipe the CO2 gas into basalt formations that lie 350 feet below the seafloor. The basalt would absorb the carbon dioxide and turn it into rock. Solid Carbon plans a demonstration project in 2024 at Cascadia Basin, about 130 miles off the coast of British Columbia.
Marine experts warn that any buried CO2 needs to be monitored to make sure it doesn't escape from the formation and bubble up into the ocean.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden's climate-change plan, particularly enhanced tax incentives for renewable energy, is very much alive in Congress -- even as other important pieces of his economic-policy agenda appear dead.
Democrats will soon try to reconstruct legislation from the ashes of the roughly $2 trillion Build Back Better bill that passed the House in November but collapsed in the Senate after opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.).
The climate-focused tax incentives, worth more than $300 billion over a decade, enjoy broad consensus among Democrats, including Mr. Manchin, though details remain to be ironed out. Many Democrats see fighting climate change as a singularly important and time-sensitive policy endeavor, making them willing to sacrifice other party goals in talks with Mr. Manchin.
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) said many Democrats feel they need to pass a climate package while the party still controls Congress and while emissions-reductions measures could prevent some of the worst consequences of climate change.
"You can't necessarily come back to it later," he said. "There are tipping points that are points of no return and there are few other public policy issues that are characterized by that kind of point-of-no-return problem."
The U.N. has released reports warning of the consequences of unabated carbon emissions and global temperature increases. Republicans, meanwhile, generally don't see the need for broad government support for clean-energy sources, meaning bipartisan action is unlikely or would be much narrower if the GOP takes control of Congress next year.
In recent weeks, Democrats have added two arguments designed to appeal more broadly to the public and to Mr. Manchin, who represents a major coal-producing state and earlier rejected a program that would have offered grants to utilities that increase clean-energy production.
Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) has described the clean-energy incentives as a way to bolster American energy independence after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Biden has made climate policy part of his anti-inflation reframing of his agenda, pitching incentives for electric vehicles and home weatherization as ways to cut families' costs.
Mr. Manchin has largely been supportive of the tax incentives for clean-energy production, which Democrats designed to encompass a variety of methods for reducing emissions, such as carbon capture. This week, he outlined a plan that would raise taxes on companies and high-income households, then split the proceeds between climate policies and deficit reduction.
"Half of that money should be dedicated to fighting inflation and reducing the deficit," he said. "The other half you can pick for a 10-year program, whatever you think was the highest priority and right now that seems to be the environment."
The comments from Mr. Manchin, whose support Democrats need to pass the package in the 50-50 Senate, encouraged other Democrats after months of stalled talks in which he dismissed other ideas. Given their past failures, it remains uncertain whether Democrats can actually ink the agreement, and it could still be several weeks before talks resume in earnest.
A package along the lines described by Mr. Manchin would require Democrats to abandon additional policy ambitions such as an expanded child tax credit. The party has previously jettisoned ideas like free community college and a corporate tax-rate increase to address concerns from Mr. Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.), yet the climate provisions remain in play.
There are likely enough tax increases to fund climate programs and deficit-reduction that are broadly acceptable to all Senate Democrats, including Ms. Sinema, whose objection to tax-rate increases has shaped the proposals. Democrats crafted a series of tax increases, including a corporate minimum tax and a surtax on very-high earners, last year with her support.
"I'm a progressive but I'm also a pragmatist," said Sen. Tina Smith (D., Minn.), who noted her support for measures such as the expanded child tax credit. "But if we don't have 50 votes for that, we don't have 50 votes for it and we should do what we can do."
The biggest climate measures being pushed by the Democrats are extensions and expansions of investment tax credits and production tax credits for cleaner energy, including for nuclear energy and certain hydrogen production. Under the House-passed plan, the structure of the breaks changes over time and they become less tied to particular technologies.
They are designed to phase out as carbon emissions fall rather than being aimed at creating price parity with fossil fuels. Additionally, they could be paid to companies that don't have tax liability to offset with credits, making them easier to use and more like spending programs. The plan includes larger tax credits to companies that pay higher wages and offer apprenticeships in clean-energy fields.
Those tax credits are aimed at accelerating changes in electricity production over the next decade, leaving tougher challenges ahead in addressing emissions stemming from transportation, agriculture and manufacturing.

Full text: Gabriela Hearst might be the only ready-to-wear designer who studies fusion and clean energy in her spare time. That is, when she has spare time.
The Uruguay-born Ms. Hearst, 45, juggles heading up her New York-based eponymous line, which she founded in 2015, and her role as the creative director of Paris brand Chloe, which she took on in 2020. (Her fall 2022 collection for that brand debuted on March 3.) Ms. Hearst's dual gigs require frequent travel between Paris and New York -- sometimes twice a month. To cope, she has learned to get work done whenever (and wherever) she has a free moment. She sketches collections on trans-Atlantic flights.
"It's like the life of an athlete, but I sleep eight hours a night. I have an Oura Ring," Ms. Hearst said, referring to the trendy sleep tracker. "Everything in my life is about my passion, my mission and my family. I don't have too many fun nights. Maybe four of those a year, maximum."
Those rare evenings will "for sure" include good food. "I'm Latin, and you cannot come to a place where the food is no good." Also, mezcal and "amazing friends with unpretentious vibes."
Just a few days before her signature brand's New York runway show in February, Ms. Hearst, dressed casually in a beanie of her own design, logged on to Zoom to discuss her love of jewelry, country music and her many "witchy" proclivities.
I consider myself: a witch. I'm the daughter of one. I don't do spells, but I have a wish list. Some people call it visualization. I've used wish lists for years. I get a lot of what I want. I put things out there with my magic and hope people around can make it happen, too.
If I'm going to drink alcohol: it's going to be mezcal. I like Ilegal and Agua Magica. I love it when they're a little aged and have that golden flavor. It's the drink of witches, if you ask me.
I just read: "The Ministry for the Future" [about climate change]. It's science fiction, but I would call it science prediction. . . . I suffer climate anxiety and I believe fusion energy is a solution for clean energy by 2030. I want to learn everything I can about it.
I grew up: on a ranch [in Uruguay]. My mom's family has been there for 170 years. She still lives there, off the grid. She used to compete in the rodeo. Then she became a taekwondo black belt. Then she was a Zen Buddhist. She defies structures of how powerful women should behave. I admire her, but she's also embarrassed me. She would pick me up from school in her taekwondo outfit. I spent my teenage years being completely mortified.
I have always preferred: stationery stores to fashion boutiques. As a kid, my favorite time was when the school year started and we had to buy pens and pencils.
I drew: 32 sketches for the new Chloe collection on the plane trip back from Paris. I don't know if they're good or bad. I try to keep ego out of the [creativity] equation. I follow where my curiosity drives me.
I take notes: with [Pilot] pens and I sketch with pencils. I don't like using erasers on the back of pencils so I always have a Caran d'Ache or Faber-Castell eraser. I like classic brands.
I go through: around seven notebooks a month. For Chloe, I use notebooks from Aspinal of London. For Gabriela Hearst, I use small ones by Fashionary. Inside my notebooks, there will be an article about climate change I cut out, a design note, a drawing that I saw or something that I dreamt and notes about fusion energy.
Among my favorite hotels are: the Aman Tokyo, the Bristol in Paris and the Carlyle in New York -- the bar is a scene.
I'm obsessed with: cherries and chocolate. Charbonnel et Walker's dark chocolate [ceri-settes] with cherries and [cherry liqueur] inside are insane. They only sell them in London. They're for special times of need.
My twin teenage daughters are into: a pinstripe suit I made for the Gabriela Hearst show before Covid. My kids are getting more excited about my closet. I feel like it's a victory.
One of my coolest garments is: a Manchester United official team Nike shirt that is probably 20 years old.
On walks, I love listening to: country music. Lately I've been playing "Sleeping on the Blacktop" by Colter Wall, "Clay Pigeons" by Blaze Foley and music by Ryan Bingham.
Energetically speaking: it's good to have a stone close to your skin. I [recently] strung ruby beads very simply into a necklace. I like how it feels on my body. I love jewelry. I make these one-ounce rings that have a hidden precious stone. I like things that have secrets.
My weekly regimen includes: Reiki and acupuncture. My acupuncturist tells me I'm like a Formula One car. He has to calibrate me, and then I'm ready.
I was a terrible: model. At 21, I was already too old. I looked very androgynous. I shaved my head, and I liked that people could confuse me with a guy. Modeling taught me rejection. Most of the time you don't get the gigs.
I was also not a good: actress. I studied acting for two years at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. Acting teaches you to be honest, to reach for authenticity all the time. I couldn't do my job without that training.
I've been watching: "Yellowstone." I understand these people: It's about ranch life.
I'm a very: impulsive person, so I use the Osho Zen Tarot app to slow myself down. I ask it, Should I post this picture on Instagram? Should I send this email? But is it the universe or the algorithm talking to me? I'm doubtful. I'm going to buy an actual tarot deck instead.
A few years ago, I discovered: the skin-care brand Biologique Recherche, and I've stuck with it. I use the Lotion P50 and La Grand Creme. Sometimes I'll get a facial from Sarah Smith in New York. She's a master.
My dream dinner party would include: the young Bob Dylan. He was so sexy. And I'd love to have Miles Davis but he wouldn't come, unless I also invited Jimi Hendrix -- [Davis] went to his funeral. I'd make sure the alcohol was good. I think they'd like picking food, tapas style.

Full text: Storms, heat waves, droughts and other extreme weather events are occurring more frequently and with greater severity than experts had predicted several years ago and are now causing serious health and economic impacts the world over, a panel of scientists convened by the United Nations said Monday in a new report.
Climate experts called the report the direst assessment of the impacts of climate change ever offered by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has been issuing climate assessments for more than three decades.
"The new contribution of this report shows how much faster these things are happening than we originally thought," said Sherilee Harper, a University of Alberta climate scientist and a lead author of the report.
Severe weather events fueled by global warming resulting from the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities have led to "widespread, pervasive impacts to ecosystems, people, settlements, and infrastructure," according to the report. The report cites the extreme wildfires that hit Alaska in 2015 and severe rainfall in Texas brought by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. It comes months after a deadly heat wave hit the Pacific Northwest.
Steps taken by some governments to adapt to climate change, such as the erection of seawalls in coastal areas and the implementation of systems that warn the public about looming heat waves, have helped reduce the impacts of such events, the report said. But it warns that the current level of preparedness globally will be insufficient to avert costly and far-reaching consequences of extreme weather events in coming decades -- and that there may be a growing need for more radical strategies, including resettlement away from vulnerable areas.
"People are suffering and dying right now from climate change, and we're not seeing an investment to try and make sure that we are prepared for an even warmer future," said Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and a lead author of the report.
The report, the most comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate change since 2014, is based on more than 34,000 studies and was compiled by 270 scientists from 67 countries. The reports are intended to help government leaders establish science-based climate policies.
"We've seen graphic compelling evidence around the world of the impacts of climate change on people and on nature," said Jane Lubchenco, deputy director for climate and environment at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, who wasn't involved with the report. "The report documents what we know about what is already happening and how it is creating real challenges for people."
Along with new data on extreme weather events during the past decade, the scientists who prepared the report made use of recent advances in attribution science. This emerging subfield of climate research seeks to determine with greater precision the role climate change plays in extreme weather events and project the growing health consequences of a warming climate.
"What you see here is an overwhelming and unfortunately confident attribution of current damages and current impacts to anthropogenic climate change," said Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
In 2015, as part of the Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries agreed to take steps to limit the rise in the global average surface temperature from preindustrial levels to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius -- and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Human activities have already led to global warming of about 1 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels, according to an IPCC assessment released in 2018. If warming progresses at the current rate, temperatures will reach 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels between 2030 and 2052, that report concluded.
Between 3.3 billion and 3.6 billion people, or nearly half the world's population, live under circumstances that make them especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, according to the new report.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The scope of federal power to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions comes before the Supreme Court on Monday, as a coalition of Republican-led states seeks to limit measures the Environmental Protection Agency can impose on power plants.
No federal regulation directly limits such emissions from power plants. Lawsuits kept both the Obama-era 2015 Clean Power Plan and the Trump administration's less-stringent replacement, the 2019 Affordable Clean Energy Rule, from taking effect. The industry met the 2015 emission targets as more efficient ways to tap renewable sources such as solar power and wind became available.
A lower-court opinion affirming a broader view of the EPA's regulatory power remains on the books, prompting the appeal from West Virginia and allied states seeking to block climate initiatives the Biden administration could propose in the future. The Supreme Court's decision to hear the case comes as its conservative majority already has found that the administration exceeded its authority in several policies aimed at combating the Covid-19 pandemic.
The EPA powers are central to President Biden's climate agenda. With fragile majorities in the Senate and House, Democrats have limited ability to advance their platform through new legislation. Like his recent predecessors, Mr. Biden instead is poised to govern through agencies such as the EPA, relying on his inherent constitutional authority and the statutory powers provided by existing legislation.
The court's conservatives, however, have increasingly come to invalidate regulatory actions they believe amount to new national policies that should be determined by legislators.
"This Court has established at least one firm rule: 'We expect Congress to speak clearly' if it wishes to assign to an executive agency decisions 'of vast economic and political significance,'" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in January, concurring with a decision to block a Biden administration plan to require large employers to vaccinate or test workers for Covid-19. "We sometimes call this the major questions doctrine."
Whether broad strategies to combat global warming run afoul of that test is central to Monday's case. A decision is expected before July.
For half a century, the Clean Air Act has directed the EPA to regulate stationary sources of air pollution that endanger "public health or welfare." The Clean Power Plan, in a move approved last year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, extended that regulatory reach beyond the physical premises of a power plant to allow off-site methods to mitigate pollution.
The decision sparked conflict between conservative states with big oil, gas and coal industries, and environmentalists who want to address climate change by phasing out those fuels. The rule effectively encouraged utilities to clean up across their fleets, with the ability to comply by replacing old, fossil-fuel-fired generation with cleaner-burning units or zero-emissions wind and solar.
Coal-producing West Virginia was among several of the states that challenged the rule, arguing the EPA's power is limited to regulations "inside the fenceline" on the covered plant itself -- a restriction that would take off the table measures that could cut emissions more dramatically and efficiently, and instead potentially make it easier for them to keep coal-burning plants alive.
Mr. Biden has promised to help eliminate emissions that contribute to global warming from U.S. power generation by 2035, but Congress has yet to approve more money and authority to do it.
Industry has changed significantly in recent years amid growing concern over climate change and falling prices for cleaner power. Many corporate titans, including the power industry itself, are backing the EPA in the case, while West Virginia's is limited to a handful of small outfits.
From 2013, power-sector emissions fell more than 21% through 2019 to their lowest point in at least 30 years, according to the most recent EPA data available. More than 30 power companies have pledged to zero out greenhouse-gas emissions from their fleets by 2050, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned utilities.
Exelon Corp. and Consolidated Edison Inc. are leading a group of 10 power companies arguing in front of the justices to uphold the EPA rules. Auto makers, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have also filed briefs in support.

Wildfire Frequency,
Intensity Set to Rise
Wildfires are expected to become more frequent and intense over the coming decades, according to new research from the United Nations.
An increase of up to 57% in the number of wildfires is expected by the end of the century, according to the report released Wednesday by the U.N. Environment Program and GRID-Arendal, an environmental group based in Norway.
Fire seasons have become hotter, dryer and longer -- fueled by a combination of increased drought, high-air temperatures, low-relative humidity, lightning and strong winds, according to the report, which had contributions from over 50 international researchers.
From Europe to the Amazon and across the U.S. and China, wildfires are disrupting the environment, wildlife and human health. More frequent wildfires could drive some animals and plant species closer to extinction, the report said. The Australian bushfires of 2019 and 2020 are estimated to have killed billions of wild and domesticated animals, the report said.
Clearing forests for agricultural purposes, and other man-made land use changes, can alter the fire dynamics of a region and could contribute to more wildfires, according to the report.
Climate change, meanwhile, has increased the frequency and magnitude of weather conditions that spread wildfires and has caused vegetation that doesn't usually burn, like rainforests and peat swamps, to dry out and combust, the researchers found. The researchers cited a review of 116 scientific articles written since 2013 on climate change and fire that conclude that a warming climate is increasing the likelihood of wildfires in many regions.
A 2021 report by the U.N.'s advisory body on climate tied the type of extreme weather events seen in recent years -- torrential floods in Europe and China, and forest fires in the U.S., Russia and elsewhere -- directly to climate change. It said the effects of a warming climate are unequivocally driven by greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity, and may be irreversible for centuries.
Douglas Kelley, one of the co-authors and lead data analyst for Wednesday's report, said researchers used a model that incorporates data on greenhouse-gas emissions from human activities to calculate estimates for how frequently major wildfires will burn in the coming decades. The model also uses data on vegetation and land-use patterns, he said.
Cutting back on emissions can reduce the risk of more frequent and intense wildfires, but only somewhat, Mr. Kelley said. Even with ambitious efforts to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, significant wildfire events are projected to grow by at least 31% by 2100, according to the report.
The researchers called on governments to increase funding focused on preventing wildfires rather than reacting to them.

ROMANIA
Illegal Logging Said
To Have Worsened
Environmental groups say Romania has failed to tackle illegal logging and nature destruction in areas protected by European Union law, two years after Brussels warned the country to put an end to illicit deforestation.
A report from nongovernmental groups Agent Green, EuroNatur, and ClientEarth, obtained by the Associated Press before its official release, alleges that destruction in Natura 2000 sites -- areas of special value protected by EU law -- has in some areas intensified since the EU Commission issued warnings in February 2020. Gabriel Paun, president of Agent Green, said that instead of curbing illegal logging, Brussels' infringement procedures triggered what he called "panic logging."
Romania, an EU member since 2007, is home to vast areas of primary forests. They are mostly situated in the Carpathian Mountains and provide habitat for large mammals like bears, wolves, and Eurasian lynx.
Romania's environment ministry said there was "no evidence that logging activities have increased since the start of the infringement procedure" and that measures the ministry implemented last year are effectively tackling illegal logging.

HAITI
Striking Workers
Clash With Police
Men wearing police uniforms fired into a group of people at a protest on Wednesday after thousands of Haitian factory workers launched a new strike to demand higher wages.
Associated Press journalists observed the men fire from a car with police license plates. At least three people were seen to be wounded, including two journalists covering the event. Earlier, police fired tear gas as protesters threw rocks at them.
A police spokesperson couldn't be reached to comment and the condition of the wounded people wasn't clear.
It was the first day of a three-day strike organized by factory workers who also shut down an industrial park earlier this month to protest pay, which then was about 500 gourdes ($4.80) for nine hours of work a day. Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced minimum-wage increases late Sunday in an attempt to quell the protests. But the increase of 185 gourdes ($1.80) a day for factory workers only served to enrage them.

Region Hit by Third
Storm in Five Days
Northern Europe was battered by the third major storm in five days, with heavy rains and high winds on Sunday and Monday killing at least two more people, disrupting travel and prompting hundreds of flood alerts across a region still recovering from last week's hurricane-force winds.
Storm Franklin pushed in from the North Atlantic on Sunday afternoon even as crews worked to clear fallen trees and restore power to thousands of customers hit by storms Dudley and Eunice last week. Heavy rains and high winds swept across Northern Ireland and northern England before moving on to France. England's environment agency issued more than 300 flood warnings and alerts and train operators urged people not to travel.
At least 14 people have died across Europe during a week of wild weather that meteorologists say is being fueled by an unusually strong jet stream over the North Atlantic.

COLOMBIA
Abortion Legalized
Up to 24 Weeks
The highest court in Colombia decriminalized abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy, the third time a large country in Latin America has lifted stringent restrictions on the procedure in a little more than a year.
The Constitutional Court's 5-4 ruling Monday comes after Mexico's Supreme Court ruled last September that making abortion a crime was unconstitutional. Argentina's Congress legalized abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy in December 2020.
The shift in these countries has energized abortion-rights advocates across a region that is mostly Catholic or evangelical.
Outside the Constitutional Court in Bogota, abortion-rights supporters danced to celebrate a victory that many had previously thought near-impossible to achieve. The court ruled criminalizing selective abortions violated women's rights under the constitution.
"It's a historic decision that provides a wide opportunity for women and girls to access abortion in this country, the most ample in Latin America," said Catalina Martinez, spokeswoman for the coalition of groups that brought the suit leading to the ruling.
Natalia Bernal, a lawyer who has advocated for abortion restrictions, called the ruling "a fatal decision for Colombia."

GERMANY
Climate Protests
Block Roads, Port
German officials condemned protests Monday by climate activists who blocked roads including near the country's biggest port.
Members of the group Uprising of the Last Generation blocked roads in Stuttgart, Freiburg and near the port of Hamburg to demand an end to food waste. The group argues that throwing away vast amounts of usable food contributes to hunger and climate change.
Bavaria's top state security official said such blockades weren't covered by freedom of assembly. "To massively impede people's mobility or block the movement of goods is a serious breach of the law," Joachim Herrmann of the conservative Christian Social Union told Funke media group.

Full text: The U.S. electrical system is becoming less dependable. The problem is likely to get worse before it gets better.
Large, sustained outages have occurred with increasing frequency in the U.S. over the past two decades, according to a Wall Street Journal review of federal data. In 2000, there were fewer than two dozen major disruptions. In 2020, the number surpassed 180.
Utility customers on average experienced just over eight hours of power interruptions in 2020, more than double the amount in 2013, when the government began tracking outage lengths. The data doesn't include 2021, but those numbers are certain to follow the trend after a freak freeze in Texas, a hurricane in New Orleans, wildfires in California and a heat wave in the Pacific Northwest left millions in the dark for days.
The power system is faltering just as millions of Americans are becoming more dependent on it -- not just to light their homes but to work remotely, charge their cars, and cook their food -- as more modern conveniences become electrified.
At the same time, the grid is undergoing the largest transformation in its history. In many parts of the U.S., utilities are no longer the dominant producers of electricity, following the creation of a patchwork of regional wholesale markets in which suppliers compete to build power plants and sell their output at the lowest price. Within the past decade, natural gas-fired plants began displacing pricier coal-fired and nuclear generators as fracking unlocked cheap gas supplies. Since then, wind and solar technologies have become increasingly cost-competitive and now rival coal, nuclear and, in some places, gas-fired plants.
Regulators in many parts of the country are attempting to further speed the build-out of renewable energy in response to concerns about climate change. A number of states have enacted mandates to eliminate carbon emissions from the grid in the coming decades, and the Biden administration has set a goal to do so by 2035.
The pace of change, hastened by market forces and long-term efforts to reduce carbon emissions, has raised concerns that power plants will retire more quickly than they can be replaced, creating new strain on the grid at a time when other factors are converging to weaken it.
One big factor is age. Much of the transmission system, which carries high-voltage electricity over long distances, was constructed just after World War II, with some lines built well before that. The distribution system, the network of smaller wires that takes electricity to homes and businesses, is also decades old, and accounts for the majority of outages.
A report last year by the American Society of Civil Engineers found that 70% of transmission and distribution lines are well into the second half of their expected 50-year lifespans. Utilities across the country are ramping up spending on line maintenance and upgrades. Still, the ASCE report anticipates that by 2029, the U.S. will face a gap of about $200 billion in funding to strengthen the grid and meet renewable energy goals.
Another factor is the changing climate. Weather-related problems have driven much of the increase in large outages shown in federal data, topping 100 in 2020 for the first time since 2011. Scientists have tied some of the weather patterns, such as California's prolonged drought and wildfires, to climate change. They project that such events will likely increase in years to come. Unlike electric systems in Europe, distribution and transmission lines in the U.S. were typically built overhead instead of buried underground, which makes them more vulnerable to weather.
Those weather extremes are raising the costs of power network upgrades for utilities all over the country. That in turn is set to raise power bills for homeowners and businesses.
Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., which serves 2.3 million electric customers in New Jersey, plans to invest as much as $16 billion in transmission and distribution improvements over the next five years to replace aging equipment and make the grid more resilient to extreme weather events, such as a highly unusual spate of tornadoes that swept the state last year.
Ralph Izzo, PSEG's chief executive, said the plan is critical to ensuring reliability, especially as customers become more dependent on the grid to charge electric vehicles and replace traditional furnaces and gas appliances with electric alternatives.
"That resiliency needs to be further enhanced, because the solutions to climate change are going to put more challenges on the grid," Mr. Izzo said. "Those are the kinds of things that really keep you awake at night."
A decade ago, coal, nuclear and gas-fired power plants -- which can produce power around the clock or fire up when needed -- supplied the bulk of the nation's electricity. Since then, wind and solar farms, whose output depends on weather and time of day, have become some of the most substantial sources of power in the U.S., second only to natural gas.
Grid operators around the country have recently raised concerns that the intermittence of some electricity sources is making it harder for them to balance supply and demand, and could result in more shortages. When demand threatens to exceed supply, as it has during severe hot and cold spells in Texas and California, grid operators may call on utilities to initiate rolling blackouts, or brief intentional outages over a region to spread the pain and prevent the wider grid from a total failure.
Companies are rapidly adding large-scale batteries to store more intermittent power so it can be discharged during peak periods after the sun falls and wind dies. But because such storage technology is somewhat new, and was, until recently, relatively expensive, it remains a small fraction of the electricity market, and grid operators agree much more will be needed to keep the system stable as more conventional power plants retire.
The problem could soon threaten New York City. The New York Independent System Operator, or NYISO, which oversees the state's power grid, last month warned of possible supply shortages in the coming years as several gas-fired power plants close or operate less frequently in light of stricter state air quality rules. New York, which has set a goal to eliminate emissions from its electricity supplies by 2040 and no longer has any coal-fired power plants, also recently shut down a nuclear plant some 30 miles north of Manhattan after critics for years called it a safety hazard.
NYISO said its reserve margins -- how much electricity it has available beyond expected demand -- are shrinking, increasing the risk of outages. A 98-degree, sustained heat wave could result in shortfalls within New York City as soon as next year, a circumstance that would likely force NYISO to call for rolling blackouts for the first time ever.
New York is adding substantial amounts of new wind and solar generation, as well as battery storage, and NYISO has said that it is critical that the projects remain on track to improve the stability of the system in the coming years. Already, wind and solar developers across the country are facing headwinds related to supply-chain issues, inflation and the amount of time it often takes to get approval to connect to the grid.
The North American Electric Reliability Corp., a nonprofit overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that develops standards for utilities and power producers, warned in a report last month that the Midwest and West also face risks of supply shortages in the coming years as more conventional power plants retire.
Within the footprint of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, which oversees a large regional grid spanning from Louisiana to Manitoba, Canada, coal- and gas-fired power plants supplying more than 13 gigawatts of power are expected to close by 2024 as a result of economic pressures, as well as efforts by some utilities to shift more quickly to renewables to address climate change. Meanwhile, only 8 gigawatts of replacement supplies are under development in the area. Unless more is done to close the gap, MISO could see a capacity shortfall, NERC said. MISO said it is aware of this potential discrepancy but declined to comment on the reasons for it.
Curt Morgan, CEO of Vistra Corp., which operates the nation's largest fleet of competitive power plants selling wholesale electricity, said he is worried about reliability risks in New York, New England and other markets as state and federal policy makers pursue ambitious goals to quickly phase out fossil fuel-fired power plants. His concern is that the plants will retire before replacements such as wind, solar and battery storage come online, he said, given the cost and challenge of quickly building enough batteries to have meaningful supply reserves.
"Everything is tied to having electricity, and yet we're not focusing on the reliability of the grid. That's absurd, and that's frightening," he said. "There's such an emotional drive to get where we want to get on climate change, which I understand, but we can't throw out the idea of having a reliable grid."
Serious electricity supply constraints have historically been rare. Most recently, the Texas grid operator called for sweeping outages during an unusually strong winter storm last February that caused power plants and natural-gas facilities of all kinds to fail in subfreezing temperatures. Millions of people were in the dark for days, and more than 200 died.
California, which experienced outages during a West-wide heat wave in the summer of 2020, also called on residents to conserve power several times last summer amid a historic drought that constrained hydroelectric power generation across the region. The state is now racing to secure large amounts of renewable energy and batteries in the coming years to account for the closure of several conventional power plants, as well as potential constraints on power imported from other states when temperatures rise.
California state Sen. Bill Dodd, Democrat from Napa, recently introduced legislation that would require the state's electricity providers to offer programs that compensate large industrial power users for quickly reducing electricity use when supplies are tight, helping to ease strain on the grid.
"We just can't go down the road of having rolling blackouts again," Mr. Dodd said. "People expect their government to keep the lights on, and our reliability situation in California still isn't where it needs to be."
Similar challenges have emerged elsewhere in the West. PNM Resources Inc., a utility that provides electricity for more than 525,000 customers in New Mexico, has warned that it would likely have to resort to rolling blackouts this coming summer, following the June retirement of a large coal-fired power plant. It has recently proposed keeping one of the generating units online for an extra three months to help meet demand during the hottest months of the year.
Tom Fallgren, PNM's vice president of generation, said the company faced significant delays in getting regulatory approval for several solar projects to replace the coal plant's output, as well as construction delays tied to supply-chain issues. A spokeswoman for the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission said the agency does its best to address all utility proposals in a fair and timely manner.
Mr. Fallgren said he anticipates even steeper challenges in the coming years as the company works to replace output from a nuclear plant with a combination of renewable energy and battery storage.
One of the biggest challenges facing grid operators and utility companies is the need for better technology that can store large amounts of electricity and discharge it over days, to account for longer weather events that affect wind and solar output. Most large-scale batteries currently use lithium-ion technology, and can discharge for about four hours at most.
Form Energy Inc., a company that is working to develop iron-air batteries as a multiday alternative to lithium-ion, recently announced plans to work with Georgia Power, a utility owned by Southern Co., to develop a battery capable of supplying as many as 15 megawatts of electricity for 100 hours. It would be a significant demonstration of the technology, which the company is aiming to broadly commercialize by 2025.
Other outage risks are mounting as extreme weather events test the strength of the grid itself. A spate of strong storms in Michigan last summer left hundreds of thousands of residents in the dark for days as utility companies rushed to make repairs. DTE Energy Co., a utility with 2.2 million electricity customers in southeastern Michigan, had more than 100,000 customers lose power.
CEO Jerry Norcia called the storm barrage unprecedented, and said the company needed to invest more heavily in reliability. DTE now plans to spend an additional $90 million to keep trees away from power lines and is working to hire more people to help maintain its system.
Michael Fuhlhage, a professor at Wayne State University who lives just outside Detroit, began noticing an uptick a few years ago in the number of times severe weather caused his lights to go out. He now measures outage length by the number of trash bags it takes to clean out his fridge.
In August, a storm caused a dayslong outage while he was visiting family, and he returned home to find a mess of spoiled food.
"That was probably a three-garbage-bag storm," he said. "We worry every time there's some kind of weather coming in now, and that's not an anxiety we had to deal with before."

Full text: Apple Inc. says it produced 47,430 tons of greenhouse gases in a recent year. The production of its computers and phones by its suppliers, plus their transportation and use by customers, generated an estimated 22 million tons.
The numbers let investors and customers decide if Apple is a lean, green machine or a carbon hog.
Now federal regulators are closing in on rules requiring all public companies to disclose their greenhouse-gas output. But they are struggling to figure out how much detail to demand about emissions produced by businesses' suppliers and customers.
At issue are so-called Scope 3 emissions, which are mostly greenhouse gases produced by a company's suppliers and by customers using its products. How to handle these indirect emissions has emerged as a sticking point inside the Securities and Exchange Commission as it deliberates on the new rules.
The 47,430 tons of greenhouse gases Apple emitted in its financial year that ended Sept. 26, 2020, is barely more than the average emissions each year from a Boeing Co. twin-aisle aircraft delivered in 2020, according to The Wall Street Journal's analysis of the plane maker's data. Apple's Scope 3 emissions are 475 times as large.
Not including these Scope 3 emissions can paint an incomplete picture of a company's impact.
According to CDP, a nonprofit group formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, supply-chain emissions alone from companies in its environmental-disclosure database were on average 11.4 times as much as operational emissions.
SEC officials drawing up the landmark rules face a balancing act. Many investors are demanding the information so they can judge the risks faced by companies from climate change and regulations designed to mitigate it.
Some business groups say that rules requiring Scope 3 disclosures would be burdensome and that available data isn't always good enough to make accurate disclosures. If the new rules stretch beyond the SEC's authority or are too onerous for companies, courts could overturn them.
The SEC is struggling to square this circle, according to people close to the agency. That has delayed the timing of its climate-reporting proposals, a priority for SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, from the end of last year to the spring of this year, the people added.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) sent a letter to the regulator on Feb. 9 urging it to move faster. "These ongoing delays are not acceptable," Ms. Warren wrote, demanding a clear timeline for the proposal by Feb. 23.
An SEC spokesman declined to comment.
The SEC's proposed rules will likely require public companies to report emissions from their operations and the energy they purchase, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2, officials have said. That is the relatively easy bit.
The agency may take a more selective approach on Scope 3 emissions. One option would require companies to report Scope 3 only if they have set specific emissions targets, such as becoming "net zero" by a certain year, people close to the agency said. Another would be to impose lighter requirements for smaller companies than for large ones.
Thomas Peterson, shareholder advocate at Boston-based asset manager Green Century Capital Management Inc., said not requiring disclosure of Scope 3 emissions would allow companies to appear to cut their carbon footprint by shifting emissions to their suppliers and customers.
At present, even the biggest companies often don't measure their full carbon footprints. Almost half of the S&P 500, or 242 companies, didn't report on Scope 3 at all in 2020, according to data provider Refinitiv. Small to medium-size companies are less likely still to measure these emissions -- likely fewer than 1 in 5 reports them, said Simon Fischweicher, a CDP official.
Those companies that do report emissions from their value chain may not measure their full carbon footprint.
Exxon Mobil Corp. began reporting Scope 3 emissions last year in response to pressure from investors. The oil company disclosed a portion of its emissions: the estimated 540 million tons of carbon created by the use of its products in 2020. Smaller sources of Scope 3 emissions, such as from transporting its oil and gas, couldn't be estimated "due to lack of third-party data," an Exxon report last year said.
Companies often resort to estimates, or rely on industrywide averages, to fill such gaps. The SEC is weighing whether to give companies a safe-harbor legal protection for unintentionally inaccurate reporting.
Walmart Inc.'s math shows the mind-boggling number-crunching that can be involved. The retailer reported that around three-quarters of its 171 million tons of Scope 3 emissions in 2020 came from its network of more than 1,200 suppliers. It figured out its suppliers' emissions by taking the data reported by 228 of them and scaling up.
Walmart "recognizes such estimates rely on broad assumptions," a spokeswoman said. "The company is working with suppliers . . . and others to improve the availability and quality of supply-chain emissions data."
Companies may also be forced to report on Scope 3 by laws in other countries, or in states. Europe is stepping up requirements for companies doing business there.

Full text: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission voted Thursday to give more weight to the environmental concerns over new natural-gas pipeline projects when deciding whether to approve them.
In a 3-2 vote along party lines, commission members changed the policy that lays out the process for reviewing and approving applications for new natural-gas pipeline projects to take into consideration a project's environmental impact and the steps a developer has taken to limit that impact. It marked the first policy update since 1999.
In a separate 3-2 vote, the commission voted to take a project's estimated greenhouse-gas emissions into consideration during approvals. It doesn't require mitigation but encourages it, according to commission staffers.
Commission Chairman Richard Glick, a Democrat, said the changes will provide more clarity to pipeline developers on how the commission will balance the need to expand affordable natural gas to customers against environmental interests. "If we were to continue [turning] a blind eye to climate change and greenhouse-gas emissions, it would simply be adding to the legal uncertainty" around project approvals, Mr. Glick said during a meeting.
Republican Commissioners James Danly and Mark Christie voted against the changes and said the guidance on what developers should now submit is unclear. "I don't think this will help the industry at all," Mr. Danly said.
The new rules were being closely watched by pipeline developers, who already face permitting court challenges, and the U.S. natural-gas export industry, which is eager to expand to send cheap and abundant gas from shale drilling overseas, including to supply-squeezed Europe amid Russian hostilities toward Ukraine.
Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.), a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Thursday's decision could stifle development of natural-gas resources.
"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is determined to make it nearly impossible for Americans to maintain or improve access to abundant and affordable supplies of natural gas," he said.
The American Petroleum Institute, the top oil and gas lobbying voice, and other industry groups had discouraged the commission from making policy changes and said it already takes a project's environmental footprint into consideration.
Under the National Gas Act, commission members weigh a project's benefits to customers who get more access to natural gas. But developers have to prove that they made efforts to eliminate or minimize any adverse effects the project might have on communities that lie in a pipeline's path.
Environmental and social-justice groups led by the Natural Resources Defense Council said the commission's scrutiny on climate considerations and air quality isn't strong enough.
Pipeline opponents have pressured the commission to revisit the policy as part of their effort to transition the U.S. energy infrastructure away from fossil fuels and toward more climate-friendly systems. Most U.S. natural gas moved through pipelines is burned, releasing greenhouse gases.
The five-member commission regulates wholesale electricity markets, high-voltage electricity transmission lines and pipeline infrastructure. It agreed to revisit its gas infrastructure policy statement in February 2021. The policy statement guides the commission's decisions and can be reviewed by judges when those decisions are challenged in court.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Sarah Bloom Raskin, the Biden administration's nominee for a top regulatory post at the Federal Reserve, is struggling to overcome resistance from Republicans on a Senate committee for which she once served as a lawyer.
This week, Republicans lawmakers united in opposition to Ms. Raskin refused to attend a crucial committee vote. That deprived Democrats of a quorum needed to advance her along with four other Fed nominees to the full Senate, including Chairman Jerome Powell.
Republicans, especially from energy-producing states such as Pennsylvania and Wyoming, are opposed to Ms. Raskin in part because of her 2020 criticism of the Treasury Department and Fed providing broad-based emergency-lending backstops to assist businesses during the pandemic. She said the backstops should have been designed to avoid lending to highly indebted fossil-fuel companies.
Her nomination followed aggressive lobbying by progressive Democrats, including many climate-focused policy activists who frequently cited Ms. Raskin's recent public remarks calling for federal regulators to use their administrative powers to pursue stiffer curbs on climate change. The White House continues to back Ms. Raskin's nomination, and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) has indicated she would advance out of committee if a quorum was reached.
Republican lawmakers more recently said they want more information about Ms. Raskin's work as a board member at an obscure financial technology payments firm, Reserve Trust. The GOP officials, led by Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, say they are perturbed by what they perceive as insufficient candor about her role as a director at the company.
The impasse comes amid philosophical fissures between some progressive Democrats, who want the central bank to play a more aggressive role addressing climate change and other social issues, and Republicans who fear the Fed is straying beyond its dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.
Senate aides described a tense lead-up to Tuesday's scheduled vote, and subsequent postponement. Mr. Toomey told Mr. Brown that he was willing to move forward with all of the Fed nominees except Ms. Raskin, and that he wanted a follow-up briefing with her to discuss her tenure at Reserve Trust, a GOP Senate aide said.
Mr. Brown said he would try to set up an additional briefing, according to the GOP aide. That briefing, tentatively planned for Feb. 11, didn't take place after the White House intervened to block it, the aide said.
Democrats dispute that another meeting was in order and say Mr. Brown never agreed to an additional briefing. Michael Gwin, a White House spokesman, said Ms. Raskin already engaged in back and forth with Senate lawmakers, including one-on-one meetings with lawmakers and responding to nearly 200 questions after her Feb. 3 hearing. He described the latest requests as a delay tactic.
Republicans have extra leverage now. While Democrats control the Senate, a stroke has prevented New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Lujan from participating in Senate business for several weeks. That means Democrats are short of votes to advance any nominees that lack Republican support or to change Senate rules that would allow them to advance Ms. Raskin's nomination if Republicans don't participate in the committee vote.
Ms. Raskin previously served on the Fed and as a top Treasury Department official during the Obama administration. Before that, she was Maryland's state commissioner of financial regulation. She is a law professor at Duke University and is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.).
Ms. Raskin has become a darling of progressive Democrats for statements such as a New York Times opinion article in May 2020 that criticized emergency-lending backstops created by the Fed to thaw frozen corporate-bond markets.
"There is no indication that the value of fossil fuel assets is ever going to return. It's one of the worst investments there is, and yet this is one that the Fed has picked," said Ms. Raskin in a video produced by the Years Project, an advocacy group that calls for more action to address climate change.
At her confirmation hearing, Ms. Raskin said she wouldn't use her Fed position to restrict lending to the oil-and-gas industry.

Panasonic Gets Factory to Zero Emissions

Full text: Panasonic Corp. got its highest-emitting Chinese factory to "virtually net zero" carbon dioxide. It took six years, showing how difficult it can be for companies to reduce their environmental footprints.
The Japanese electronics company pledged to eliminate or offset all of the greenhouse-gas emissions generated by its operations by 2030. But even tackling that one factory, which produces batteries in the city of Wuxi, near Shanghai, was tough, company officials say.
Panasonic incrementally trimmed its energy consumption through measures such as replacing workers with robots and fluorescent lights with LEDs. When that wasn't enough, it bought carbon credits and renewable energy, finally letting it declare it had neutralized the plant's emissions last year.
Large companies around the world are beginning to take similar steps to address their contributions to the greenhouse effect, as many make "net zero" emissions pledges to cut and counter their emissions, urged on by investors, corporate customers and consumers.
Panasonic, one of the biggest corporate carbon emitters in the world according to estimates by the company and outside experts, is just getting started. It has to repeat its Wuxi feat 37 times over to neutralize the roughly 2.2 million metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions associated with the company's operations.
And those emissions are 2% of the 110 million metric tons Panasonic estimates it is responsible for, when its suppliers and the use of its products are included. While the company has a 2030 goal for emissions from its direct operations, it has given itself until 2050 to deal with its entire carbon footprint -- an amount five times the size of Apple Inc.'s, and roughly equivalent to half of Spain's annual emissions.
For Panasonic -- a 104-year-old manufacturing behemoth that has more than 10,000 suppliers and makes everything from refrigerators and TVs to fuses for surge protectors -- just zeroing out emissions at factories by 2030 will be extremely hard, said Ryuji Shimono, a general manager in charge of external affairs at Panasonic's environment division. But these days, he said, decarbonizing "is a matter of competitiveness."
Panasonic turned its attention to the Wuxi factory in 2015, the year that the international Paris climate agreement set a target to keep rising global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
The plant makes lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries -- the kind that power devices such as laptops, electric bikes and emergency lighting. It uses a lot of energy -- mostly electricity, which it consumes in especially large quantities to charge and discharge the batteries during the testing process, and fossil fuel-generated steam, used for equipment such as dryers and dehumidifiers.
At the time, Panasonic calculated that electricity and steam was responsible for around 60,000 metric tons of carbon emissions a year -- the highest amount among Panasonic's 50-odd manufacturing sites in China and around a tenth of its total in the country.
Panasonic generally tries to reduce emissions by curbing the amount of energy it uses and by generating its own clean electricity. So the Wuxi factory started installing solar panels on the roofs of its buildings, bringing in enough to cut its estimated emissions by around 1,250 metric tons.
Managers had to think hard to come up with new ways of trimming energy consumption, said Peng Li, the plant's business planning director. They introduced a more energy-efficient way of running the factory's dust collectors, air compressors and exhaust fans, resulting in a reduction of 660 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year.
The factory tackled its worker-heavy production lines, automating processes and switching to robots. The moves reduced the number of employees by 38%, the amount of energy consumed per battery by 11% and emissions by 2,710 metric tons. It replaced 13,725 fluorescent and other types of lamps with lower-wattage LEDs and traded energy-saving tips with a nearby factory of Japanese office-machine maker Konica Minolta Inc.
Engineers consulted with one of the Wuxi factory's equipment manufacturers, finding a way to collect and recycle some of the electricity produced when batteries discharge. Yet, after all that, the factory had only managed to trim around a quarter of its estimated emissions by 2020.
"In the beginning we tried all kinds of energy-saving measures," Ms. Peng said. "But for a time we were quite troubled over how we were going to get to zero."
In the end, Panasonic, like other companies, turned to financial instruments that let it cancel out carbon emissions it was generating by buying units of clean energy or emissions reductions created elsewhere. To handle the Wuxi factory's electricity, which accounted for around 80% of the remaining 44,000 metric tons of carbon emissions, the company bought renewable energy certificates, each of which represented a megawatt-hour of power produced by a local wind, solar or other clean-energy project. That purchase let the Wuxi factory replace the equivalent amount of electricity from China's grid, which tends to be heavily dependent on coal-fired power plants.
To counter the emissions from the production of its steam, the factory bought carbon credits issued by projects -- such as planting trees or protecting forests -- that reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or prevent emissions from increasing.
For now, the factory's managers say, the cost to buy carbon credits and renewable energy certificates in China is affordable: roughly $47,000 in 2021, or around half a percentage point of what the factory pays to power its equipment. That means Panasonic could reduce and offset Wuxi's emissions without raising the price of the batteries it produces.
But the Wuxi factory's managers worry the cost of such certificates will rise as more companies rush to go green.
"Everybody is going to be focusing on [these instruments], and the price will go up," said Huang Hua, who heads the plant's human resources and facility department. "We can't just rely on them."

Company Nudged
On Its Green Goals
In 2017, Panasonic was targeted by Climate Action 100+, a group of global investors that presses the world's hundred-or-so largest emitters to reduce their carbon footprints.
The California Public Employees' Retirement System, which belongs to the group, reaches out twice a year to nudge Panasonic on emissions-cutting and other green goals.
At least one European car maker has asked Panasonic to ensure the parts it supplies are carbon-free in the near future, and more corporate customers are likely to follow suit, said Mr. Shimono, who declined to name the car company in question. Apple, which lists Panasonic as a supplier, has said it would "achieve carbon neutrality" for its supply chain by 2030.
Other Apple suppliers -- such as chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known as Foxconn -- have set goals to cut carbon emissions.

Full text: PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced a plan to build six new nuclear reactors, betting on a technology that produces electricity with almost zero greenhouse-gas emissions but faces big questions about the high cost of new projects.
As part of the plan, Electricite de France SA, the country's state-controlled power company, reached a deal to buy part of the nuclear steam-turbine business of General Electric Co., including several factories in France. The two sides didn't disclose a price.
The Macron government is making nuclear energy the cornerstone of the country's response to climate change. The president is also trying to turn the tide on a decadeslong slide in public support for the nuclear industry across the West.
Thursday's announcement is among the world's most ambitious reactor-construction plans since the 2011 nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan, dealt a blow to efforts to build new reactors world-wide. In addition to the six reactors, Mr. Macron said the government would study the construction of an additional eight reactors and launch a sweeping plan to bolster the country's nuclear-construction industry. He set a target date of 2035 for the first of the new reactors to come online.
"We are now convinced, and I think that it's scientifically established, that if we want to succeed in the climate transition, the energy sovereignty of our country, and industrial production, we have to make this choice," Mr. Macron told workers on Thursday at a GE factory in Belfort, a town near the Swiss border.
Mr. Macron is attempting to counter opponents of nuclear energy who have argued the technology isn't safe and is too costly to be part of the solution to the climate crisis. Across the Rhine, Germany is in the process of shutting all its nuclear reactors. Belgium has said it would do the same. In the U.S., utilities are also shutting reactors.
France relies on nuclear power to generate more than 70% of its electricity. But the average age of its fleet of reactors is 37 years old, putting pressure on authorities to bring a new generation on to the market in the coming years.
France's nuclear industry has struggled mightily in recent years to build new reactors. EDF projects in Finland, France and the U.K. are years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. Executives and officials say France's industry has lost much of its expertise in the nuclear-construction slump following the Fukushima accident.
"There was a moment when we stopped producing," Mr. Macron said, "and that rupture really weakened the industry."
Industry executives and officials say another problem has been the complexity of coordinating activities with external suppliers such as GE. Officials hope that bringing some of them in-house will help avoid those problems in the future.
GE bought the nuclear-turbine business from French company Alstom SA in 2015 for 9.7 billion euros ($11.1 billion at current exchange rates), a deal Mr. Macron helped broker when he was an aide to former President Francois Hollande. The division has since suffered as electricity utilities around the world slashed their investments in nuclear energy and instead invested heavily in renewable technologies such as wind and solar power.
GE last year proposed laying off some 200 workers from the division. That posed a problem for Mr. Macron as he is gearing up to run for re-election in April.

Full text: The Covid-19 pandemic has caused corporate America to rethink what it wants in a headquarters. Millions of people are productively working from home and may never again spend five days a week in the office. Some have moved from places like New York to cheaper, smaller cities. The first corporate offices are joining the newest migration wave, and more will likely follow. But as they pick the site of their future headquarters, companies aren't just thinking about what their employees want today. "They think about something that might be 30 years from now," says Robert Hess, vice chairman at real-estate services firm Newmark.
Some things are unlikely to change. Companies will probably always want low taxes, an educated workforce and a big airport. But other factors are likely to become far more important in the future. As global warming worsens storms, wildfires and heat waves, more companies will likely look for cities that are prepared for natural disasters and offer green energy, site-selection consultants say. The rise of e-bikes, e-scooters and self-driving cars means cities looking to appeal to companies will need a new transportation infrastructure. Cheap housing, nightlife and access to nature are also bound to become more important.
Here are 10 key factors for cities looking to attract corporate headquarters in coming years.
Company Apartments
It may not be enough for cities to offer companies land and tax breaks to build an office. They may also need to offer apartments. Surging housing costs are contributing to rising wages, making it more expensive for companies to hire. They are also making it harder to retain employees, as people leave jobs to move to cheaper cities. Cities will either need to build plenty of affordable housing, or offer tax breaks and lands to companies to do it themselves. "If there's something you can do to make the cost of living cheaper, you're going to have a leg up on every single competitor," says Colin Behring, CEO of real-estate developer Behring Co.
Nightlife
In a tight labor market, companies are fighting harder than ever to keep their employees from leaving and to attract new recruits. That means they are increasingly eager to be in cities where their workers enjoy living, site-selection consultants say. Austin, Texas, is attracting more big companies than some other Sunbelt cities in part because of its restaurant and music scene. "People want more than just a place to work," says Chris Lloyd, chairman of the trade association Site Selectors Guild and senior vice president at McGuireWoods Consulting.
Disaster Protections
Worsening storms, wildfires and heat waves pose a challenge to companies looking to keep their offices open and employees safe. That means firms will increasingly look to be in cities with strong protections against natural disasters, says Mahesh Ramanujam, the former head of the U.S. Green Building Council. Disaster-proofing the electricity grid is the first task, he said. Widespread power outages such as in Manhattan after superstorm Sandy in 2012 can cripple corporations for days. Protecting offices from flooding and employees' suburban homes from fires is also important. And in places like Arizona, cities need to make sure buildings and infrastructure can withstand extreme heat as climate change heats up the globe.
Urban Resorts
As more people work remotely, some companies are bringing employees together once a quarter from their far-flung home offices. The goal: developing the kind of company culture and personal relationships that are hard to maintain over video calls. That means companies need space for employees to stay and socialize. Urban resorts could help fill that need, some property developers say. Unlike today's conference hotels, which usually offer little beyond meeting space and catering, these resorts may include outdoor pools, nightclubs, water parks, casinos and other amenities where workers can have fun during off-hours.
Lanes for E-bikes and E-scooters
The pandemic has changed the way many urban residents get to work. A growing number are switching from buses and subways to electric bikes and scooters, which are proliferating across the U.S. as a fast, easy and cheap way to bridge short distances. Offering a network of protected bike lanes could make cities more appealing to big companies, says Rohit Aggarwala, senior urban tech fellow at Cornell Tech. "If you're keeping people out of automobiles, you're making the streets safer and more pleasant," he says. As food delivery becomes a bigger part of office life, these lanes could also offer space for smaller self-driving vehicles transporting food from restaurants.
Self-Driving Cars Welcome
Self-driving, electric cars are set to become a key mode of transportation for people and goods. They could also help boost corporate productivity, allowing more people to work while they commute. Mr. Lloyd says some of his corporate clients are increasingly interested in cities that are looking to create a friendly environment for self-driving cars. Offering plenty of charging stations is just the start. In the future, cities should create networks of sensors and systems that can feed these cars information on traffic lights, road closures and traffic jams, he says. "If you're going to have an effective system of autonomous vehicles, it's going to move much more efficiently if the vehicle is communicating back and forth with the city system."
Tunnels
In booming cities like Nashville, Tenn., and Austin, traffic jams cause many lost work hours. Part of the solution may lie underground. Subways as well as below-ground shopping and eating venues have been part of the success of cities like New York and London. "You physically can tunnel deeper than buildings are tall, meaning five to six overlapping or stacked tunnels can create a pretty dynamic navigation map," Mr. Behring says. Underground roads wouldn't just shorten commute times -- they could also free up space above for parks and pedestrians, he says.
Ultrafast Internet
Access to cheap, reliable and ultrafast internet is crucial to most companies. The spread of remote work means companies need to think not just about internet connections in their offices, but also in their employees' apartments, on streets and in local coffee shops. In cities where a single company controls the supply of ultrafast internet and overcharges for service, costs can become a problem. "That can become a drain on the local economy. It's basically a tax that people will have to pay," Mr. Aggarwala says. To ensure access to cheap, fast internet, major cities like New York should create public corporations to build out fiber networks, for example by issuing debt to pay for the cables and raising revenue from users, he says.
Nature Parks
Companies looking to keep their employees happy, healthy and productive could increasingly look for cities with access to greenery and natural outdoor spaces. Visits to national parks surged during the Covid-19 pandemic. Being able to take a lunch-break hike in the mountains is already a big reason why cities like Boulder, Colo., are attracting big companies. And some companies are even looking to include hiking trails in their office campuses. Amazon, for instance, is building a 350-foot office tower in Arlington, Va., that will feature two spiraling outdoor walkways with local plants and trees twisting to the building's top. Trees also help absorb carbon emissions and clean the air -- another priority for companies looking to be more environmentally friendly.
Clean Energy
One company after another is pledging to eventually reduce net carbon emissions to zero. That makes access to green energy at cheap prices increasingly important. Big tech firms, which are among the most sought-after office users, are particularly eager for carbon-neutral sources of electricity. Cities that can't offer nearby wind farms or hydroelectric power face a disadvantage when they compete for big corporate offices, site-selection consultants say. "ESG is not a fad anymore," says Mr. Hess of Newmark, referring to the acronym for environmental, social and governance. "Some of these larger cities would be smart to have offshore wind."

. . . And What's No Longer in Vogue for HQ Cities
When industrialist Francis Cabot Lowell and his partners founded the Boston Manufacturing Company in 1813, they picked Waltham, Mass., as its headquarters. The reason: The Charles River ran through the town with enough speed to power a textile mill. Over the following two centuries, the things companies look for in cities changed dramatically. Many of the factors that once led firms to pick some cities over others for their headquarters no longer matter.
The rise of coal-powered steam engines in the 19th century meant towns on downward-rushing rivers like Waltham soon lost much of their appeal, according to Douglas W. Rae's book "City." Coal was easier to transport to port towns with calmer waters like Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, meaning they became more attractive to America's big industrial firms. Some companies settled near railway hubs, leading to the growth of cities like Atlanta.
By the middle of the 20th century, the spread of cars and trucks meant firms no longer had to be close to ports and railway lines to move their employees and goods. The spread of telephone lines was just as important. Thanks to cheap long-distance calls, "all of a sudden you don't actually have to be in New York in order to get the most up-to-date information about, say, how the London Stock Market is doing," says Mr. Aggarwala of Cornell Tech. Untethered from ports and rail, many companies began moving where their executives and employees wanted to live: the suburbs and sunny, low-tax Sunbelt cities.
Now, corporate preferences are once again changing. Housing costs and internet availability are a growing concern. Even rushing water is making a comeback: Big corporations like Microsoft increasingly seek out hydropower as a green-energy source.

Full text: BOULDER, Colo. -- For almost five years, an international consortium of scientists was chasing clouds, determined to solve a problem that bedeviled climate-change forecasts for a generation: How do these wisps of water vapor affect global warming?
They reworked 2.1 million lines of supercomputer code used to explore the future of climate change, adding more-intricate equations for clouds and hundreds of other improvements. They tested the equations, debugged them and tested again.
The scientists would find that even the best tools at hand can't model climates with the sureness the world needs as rising temperatures impact almost every region.
When they ran the updated simulation in 2018, the conclusion jolted them: Earth's atmosphere was much more sensitive to greenhouse gases than decades of previous models had predicted, and future temperatures could be much higher than feared -- perhaps even beyond hope of practical remedy.
"We thought this was really strange," said Gokhan Danabasoglu, chief scientist for the climate-model project at the Mesa Laboratory in Boulder at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR. "If that number was correct, that was really bad news."
At least 20 older climate models disagreed with the new one at NCAR, an open-source model called the Community Earth System Model 2, or CESM2, funded mainly by the U.S. National Science Foundation and arguably the world's most influential. Then, one by one, a dozen climate-modeling groups around the world produced similar forecasts.
The scientists soon concluded their new calculations had been thrown off kilter by the physics of clouds in a warming world, which may amplify or damp climate change. "The old way is just wrong, we know that," said Andrew Gettelman, a physicist at NCAR who specializes in clouds and helped develop the CESM2 model. "I think our higher sensitivity is wrong too. It's probably a consequence of other things we did by making clouds better and more realistic. You solve one problem and create another."
Since then the CESM2 scientists have been reworking their algorithms using a deluge of new information about the effects of rising temperatures to better understand the physics at work. They have abandoned their most extreme calculations of climate sensitivity, but their more recent projections of future global warming are still dire -- and still in flux.
As world leaders consider how to limit greenhouse gases, they depend on what computer climate models predict. But as algorithms and the computer they run on become more powerful -- able to crunch far more data and do better simulations -- that very complexity has left climate scientists grappling with mismatches among competing computer models.
While vital to calculating ways to survive a warming world, climate models are hitting a wall. They are running up against the complexity of the physics involved; the limits of scientific computing; uncertainties around the nuances of climate behavior; and the challenge of keeping pace with rising levels of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Despite significant improvements, the new models are still too imprecise to be taken at face value, which means climate-change projections still require judgment calls.
"We have a situation where the models are behaving strangely," said Gavin Schmidt, director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Sciences, a leading center for climate modeling. "We have a conundrum."
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change collates the latest climate data drawn from thousands of scientific papers and dozens of climate models, including the CESM2 model, to set an international standard for evaluating the impacts of climate change. That provides policy makers in 195 countries with the most up-to-date scientific consensus related to global warming. Its next major advisory report, which will serve as a basis for international negotiations, is expected this year.
For climate modelers, the difference in projections amounts to a few degrees of average temperature change in response to levels of carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere in years ahead. A few degrees will be more than enough, most scientists say, to worsen storms, intensify rainfall, boost sea-level rise -- and cause more-extreme heat waves, droughts and other temperature-related consequences such as crop failures and the spread of infectious diseases.
When world leaders in 1992 met in Rio de Janeiro to negotiate the first comprehensive global climate treaty, there were only four rudimentary models that could generate global-warming projections for treaty negotiators.
In November 2021, as leaders met in Glasgow to negotiate limits on greenhouse gases under the auspices of the 2015 Paris Accords, there were more than 100 major global climate-change models produced by 49 different research groups, reflecting an influx of people into the field. During the treaty meeting, U.N. experts presented climate-model projections of future global-warming scenarios, including data from the CESM2 model. "We've made these models into a tool to indicate what could happen to the world," said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the NCAR Mesa Laboratory. "This is information that policy makers can't get any other way."
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in October awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics to scientists whose work laid the foundation for computer simulations of global climate change.
Skeptics have scoffed at climate models for decades, saying they overstate hazards. But a growing body of research shows many climate models have been uncannily accurate. For one recent study, scientists at NASA, the Breakthrough Institute in Berkeley, Calif., and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology evaluated 17 models used between 1970 and 2007 and found most predicted climate shifts were "indistinguishable from what actually occurred."
Still, models remain prone to technical glitches and are hampered by an incomplete understanding of the variables that control how our planet responds to heat-trapping gases.
In its guidance to governments last year, the U.N. climate-change panel for the first time played down the most extreme forecasts.
Before making new climate predictions for policy makers, an independent group of scientists used a technique called "hind-casting," testing how well the models reproduced changes that occurred during the 20th century and earlier. Only models that re-created past climate behavior accurately were deemed acceptable.
In the process, the NCAR-consortium scientists checked whether the advanced models could reproduce the climate during the last Ice Age, 21,000 years ago, when carbon-dioxide levels and temperatures were much lower than today. CESM2 and other new models projected temperatures much colder than the geologic evidence indicated. University of Michigan scientists then tested the new models against the climate 50 million years ago when greenhouse-gas levels and temperatures were much higher than today. The new models projected higher temperatures than evidence suggested.
While accurate across almost all other climate factors, the new models seemed overly sensitive to changing carbon-dioxide levels and, for the past several years, scientists have been meticulously fine-tuning them to narrow the uncertainties.
Then there is the cloud conundrum. Because clouds can both reflect solar radiation into space and trap heat from Earth's surface, they are among the biggest challenges for scientists honing climate models.
At any given time, clouds cover more than two-thirds of the planet. Their impact on climate depends on how reflective they are, how high they rise and whether it is day or night. They can accelerate warming or cool it down. They operate at a scale as broad as the ocean, as small as a hair's width. Their behavior can be affected, studies show, by factors ranging from cosmic rays to ocean microbes, which emit sulfur particles that become the nuclei of water droplets or ice crystals.
"If you don't get clouds right, everything is out of whack." said Tapio Schneider, an atmospheric scientist at the California Institute of Technology and the Climate Modeling Alliance, which is developing an experimental model. "Clouds are crucially important for regulating Earth's energy balance."
Older models, which rely on simpler methods to model clouds' effects, for decades asserted that doubling the atmosphere's carbon dioxide over preindustrial levels would warm the world between 2.7 and 8 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius).
New models account for clouds' physics in greater detail. CESM2 predicted that a doubling of carbon dioxide would cause warming of 9.5 degrees Fahrenheit (5.3 degrees Celsius) -- almost a third higher than the previous version of their model, the consortium scientists said.
In an independent assessment of 39 global-climate models last year, scientists found that 13 of the new models produced significantly higher estimates of the global temperatures caused by rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide than the older computer models -- scientists called them the "wolf pack." Weighed against historical evidence of temperature changes, those estimates were deemed unrealistic.
By adding far-more-detailed equations to simulate clouds, the scientists might have introduced small errors that could make their models less accurate than the cloud assumptions of older models, according to a study by NCAR scientists published in January 2021. Taking the uncertainties into account, the U.N.'s climate-change panel narrowed its estimate of climate sensitivity to a range between 4.5 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (2.5 to 4 degrees Celsius) in its most recent report for policy makers last August.
Dr. Gettelman, who helped develop CESM2, and his colleagues in their initial upgrade added better ways to model polar ice caps and how carbon and nitrogen cycle through the environment. To make the ocean more realistic, they added wind-driven waves.
Since releasing the open-source software in 2018, the NCAR scientists have updated the CESM2 model five times, with more improvements in development. "We are still digging," said Jean-Francois Lamarque, director of NCAR's climate and global dynamics laboratory, who was the project's former chief scientist. "It is going to take quite a few years."
The NCAR scientists in Boulder would like to delve more deeply into the behavior of clouds, ice sheets and aerosols, but they already are straining their five-year-old Cheyenne supercomputer, according to NCAR officials. A climate model able to capture the subtle effects of individual cloud systems, storms, regional wildfires and ocean currents at a more detailed scale would require a thousand times more computer power, they said.
"There is this balance between building in all the complexity we know and being able to run the model for hundreds of years multiple times," said Andrew Wood, an NCAR scientist who works on the CESM2 model. "The more complex a model is, the slower it runs."
Researchers now are under pressure to make reliable local forecasts of future climate changes so that municipal managers and regional planners can protect heavily populated locales from more extreme flooding, drought or wildfires. That means the next generation of climate models need to link rising temperatures on a global scale to changing conditions in a local forest, watershed, grassland or agricultural zone, said Jacquelyn Shuman, a forest ecologist at NCAR who is researching how to model the impact of climate change on regional wildfires.
"Computer models that contain both large-scale and small-scale models allow you to really do experiments that you can't do in the real world," she said. "You can really ramp up the temperature, dial down the precipitation or completely change the amount of fire or lightning strikes that an area is seeing, so you can really diagnose how it all works together. That's the next step. It would be very computationally expensive."
The NCAR scientists are installing a new $40 million supercomputer named Derecho, built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise designed to run climate-change calculations at three times the speed of their current machine. Once it becomes operational this year, it is expected to rank among the world's top 25 or so fastest supercomputers, NCAR officials said.

Full text: 'Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. . . . It is capitalism." Or so BlackRock CEO Larry Fink claimed in his annual letter to America's CEOs last month, in which he called on corporate chiefs to stay true to their own companies' "purpose."
"Putting your company's purpose at the foundation of your relationships with your stakeholders is critical to your long-term success. . . . Your company's purpose is its north star in this tumultuous environment. . . . It is more important than ever that your company and its management be guided by its purpose." Mr. Fink's four-page letter invokes the word "purpose" eight times.
But whose purpose, exactly? In the same letter, Mr. Fink also calls on CEOs to set "short-, medium-, and long-term targets for greenhouse gas reductions." His demands are explicit: "We ask you to issue reports consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures." BlackRock regularly makes demands such as these of its portfolio companies, requiring them to meet the standards of its "sustainability accounting standards board."
Mr. Fink claims he wants CEOs to stay true to the purposes of the companies they run, while also demanding that they advance the corporate purposes that BlackRock favors. He can't have it both ways.
Take Exxon Mobil. In 2018 the company's guiding principle was clear: "Exxon Mobil Corporation is committed to being the world's premier petroleum and petrochemical company." The company stated that its first responsibility was to make money for shareholders.
Then last year a little-known investment firm called Engine No. 1, which held a 0.02% stake in Exxon, won three seats on Exxon's 12-member board. Engine No. 1 waged an activist campaign claiming that Exxon should reduce its carbon emissions and become a global leader in profitable clean-energy production. BlackRock, Exxon's second-largest shareholder, voted for three of Engine No. 1's climate-focused board candidates. BlackRock claimed that its vote was motivated by concern over Exxon's lack of a clear climate-change strategy. Every savvy market participant at the time knew that Engine No. 1's proxy battle would end wherever BlackRock cast its die. Few knew that Engine No. 1 CEO Jennifer Grancio had been a managing director at BlackRock from 1999 to 2018.
The world's most influential impact investor had its desired impact. Before the proxy battle, Exxon had planned to increase oil and gas production by 25% over the next five years. After the proxy battle, Exxon plans to keep oil output at the lowest level in two decades, a 20% decline from prior forecasts. More recently, it pledged net-zero global emissions in its own operations by 2050. Exxon Mobil once had a clear purpose, but BlackRock didn't want the American oil-and-gas company to be "guided" by it. BlackRock wanted the company to change it. And that's what Exxon did.
Royal Dutch Shell now faces a similar problem. BlackRock is the company's largest shareholder. Dan Loeb's Third Point, an activist shareholder in Royal Dutch Shell, recently wrote a public letter to its board: "Shell has too many competing stakeholders pushing it in too many different directions, resulting in an incoherent, conflicting set of strategies attempting to appease multiple interests but satisfying none." Some shareholders want Shell to invest as aggressively as possible in renewable energy, while others want Shell to give priority to returns on capital from its legacy oil-and-gas businesses. Mr. Loeb proposed a breakup of Shell into two companies, each of which could pursue its own standalone "purpose" separately.
Suppose Royal Dutch Shell follows Mr. Loeb's advice by splitting itself into Green Energy Corp. and Oil & Gas Corp. Should Oil & Gas follow BlackRock's mandate to "stay true to its purpose"? Or should it follow BlackRock's admonition to "set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions"? Mr. Fink says he means the first, but BlackRock's behavior at Exxon suggests he really means the second.
Mr. Fink argues that he doesn't foist BlackRock's own values onto anyone, but simply encourages portfolio companies to adapt to the way the world is already heading: "Every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world. The question is, will you lead, or will you be led. ... Will you go the way of the dodo, or will you be a phoenix?"
Yet Mr. Fink's argument is circular. BlackRock is now the world's largest asset manager, with $10 trillion under management. President Biden's climate policies are heavily influenced by recent BlackRock alumni. Brian Deese, the firm's former global head of sustainable investing, is now the director of the National Economic Council. Michael Pyle, BlackRock's former global chief investment strategist, is Vice President Kamala Harris's chief economic adviser. Wally Adeyemo, Mr. Fink's former chief of staff, is deputy Treasury secretary. Mr. Fink's claim that he is merely responding to the "transition to a net zero world" obscures his own firm's role in catalyzing that transition.
BlackRock's influence extends beyond climate change. In recent weeks, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin have pressed Mr. Fink to intervene in a miners strike at the Warrior Met Coal company in Brookwood, Ala. "Mr. Fink, our request to you is simple," the senators wrote. "BlackRock's Board must publicly demand that Warrior Met negotiate in good faith and agree to a reasonable contract that treats workers with dignity and respect." Tellingly, these senators chose to apply more pressure on Mr. Fink than on Walter Scheller, Warrior Met's CEO.
If stakeholder capitalism is capitalism, as Mr. Fink says, then the public deserves to know why he's so adamant on drawing the distinction. He should be honest about whether he wants BlackRock's portfolio companies to pursue their own corporate purposes or the purposes that BlackRock favors. Mr. Fink concludes the opening remarks of his annual letter by bemoaning the "erosion of trust in traditional institutions," without offering any explanation for why that trust has waned. He would do well to consider the growing gulf between what the world's most influential business leaders say and what they actually mean.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden's nominee to become the Federal Reserve's top bank regulator, said that she wouldn't use the position to restrict lending to the oil-and-gas industry, after she has previously called for more-aggressive regulatory moves away from high-emission investments.
"It is inappropriate for the Fed to make credit decisions and allocations based on choosing winners and losers," Ms. Raskin said Thursday, at her confirmation hearing held by the Senate Banking Committee. "Banks choose their borrowers, not the Fed."
Republican senators at the hearing said her remarks appeared to be at odds with her past statements. They cited a May 2020 New York Times opinion article, in which Ms. Raskin was critical of broad-based emergency-lending backstops enacted by the Treasury Department and the Fed to assist businesses during the pandemic, because she believed they should have taken steps to prevent lending to oil-and-gas concerns.
"The decisions the Fed makes on our behalf should build toward a stronger economy with more jobs in innovative industries -- not prop up and enrich dying ones," she wrote in the 2020 article.
Sen. Pat Toomey, of Pennsylvania, the top Republican on the committee, called her statements at the hearing "one of the most remarkable cases of confirmation conversion I have ever seen."
Ms. Raskin said her views on regulators' role in addressing climate issues haven't changed. She said the 2020 article was written about the way the government set up its emergency-lending programs. The article "did not have to do with the context of supervision and regulation," she said.
Mr. Biden picked Ms. Raskin to serve as the Fed's vice chairwoman for supervision. She testified at the hearing along with two economists nominated for other Fed board posts: Lisa Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University, and Philip Jefferson, a professor and administrator at Davidson College in North Carolina.
Republican opposition to the nominees could impede their confirmation in the closely divided Senate.
At Thursday's hearing, the nominees told lawmakers that the Fed must make it a priority to tackle high inflation. "The spike in inflation we are seeing today threatens heightened expectations of future inflation," Mr. Jefferson said. "The Federal Reserve must remain attentive to this risk and ensure that inflation declines to levels consistent with its goals."
Asked about the Fed officials' recent signals that they would begin steadily raising interest rates in mid-March to combat price pressures, Dr. Cook said she agrees with the Fed's path right now, but added that she would want to analyze data closer to any decision, should she be confirmed.
Some Republicans suggested at the hearing that Dr. Cook lacked sufficient experience in macroeconomics and monetary policy.
"Even more concerning to me with respect to your nomination is that your background . . . doesn't seem related to the mission of the Federal Reserve," said Sen. Bill Hagerty (R., Tenn.). "If I look at your list of publications and your speeches, it seems more like social science than it does economics and monetary policy."
Dr. Cook responded by highlighting her research experience and former work at the Treasury Department and White House Council of Economic Advisers, where she said she worked on matters related to financial crises.
Much of questioning Thursday revolved around Ms. Raskin's past calls for the Fed and other federal financial regulators to more rapidly address growing threats from climate-related events such as natural disasters and wildfires.
On Thursday, Republicans said addressing climate change would go beyond the Fed's mandate.
Ms. Raskin said that her views have remained consistent, saying that the Fed "should not pick winners and losers, they should not be exposing taxpayers to undue risk."
Ms. Raskin, a lawyer, served as a Fed governor and as a top Treasury Department official during the Obama administration.
Banking committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) praised all three nominees, saying they "understand the importance of empowering workers through full employment, and the need to combat inflation so paychecks go farther."
Moderate Democrats on the Senate banking panel who may hold the key to Ms. Raskin's confirmation signaled they would likely support her.
The confirmations of Dr. Cook and Mr. Jefferson, who are Black, would help Mr. Biden fulfill his promise to improve diversity atop the central bank, which in its history has had only three Black board members, all of them men.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden's pick to become the government's most influential bank regulator, could face a contentious hearing on Thursday when she testifies before Senate lawmakers, a key hurdle for confirmation.
Ms. Raskin, who was nominated to serve as the Federal Reserve's vice chairwoman for supervision, will likely face questions on her calls for regulators to speed up the transition from fossil fuels and her support for tougher banking rules.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week urged Senate lawmakers to scrutinize Ms. Raskin's views on climate and other matters, while 41 oil-and-gas trade groups pressed lawmakers to oppose her, citing her climate stances.
In prepared testimony released by the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, Ms. Raskin said that her role at the Fed would entail working closely with other central bank officials and banks to identify, analyze and manage their risks. "The role does not involve directing banks to make loans only to specific sectors, or to avoid making loans to particular sectors," she said.
Ms. Raskin hasn't encountered opposition from banks that helped torpedo the nomination of Saule Omarova, whom Mr. Biden tapped for a separate post overseeing national banks. That fight was led by community banks, which have a more favorable view of Ms. Raskin from her former stints in government.
Ms. Raskin is set to appear before the committee along with two economists tapped for other Fed board seats: Lisa Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University, and Philip Jefferson, a professor and administrator at Davidson College in North Carolina.
Ms. Raskin previously served as a Fed governor and as a top Treasury Department official during the Obama administration. In recent years, she has been outspoken about how the Fed should tackle climate-related financial risks.
Critics say Ms. Raskin's calls for regulators to motivate a more rapid transition away from loans to high-emission industries go beyond the scope of the Fed's authority.
An administration official said Ms. Raskin is opposed to the Fed allocating credit by sector or choking off sectors from access to credit. While Ms. Raskin believes the pacing to address and adjust to climate change is important, it is not set by the Fed but rather by Congress and market forces, the official also said.

Full text: LONDON -- Mark Carney, the former head of the central banks of the U.K. and Canada and the United Nations' point man on climate change and finance, has taken on a new role advising companies on the global economy with Macro Advisory Partners, a consulting firm.
Mr. Carney has been appointed senior counselor, the firm said Monday, adding another role to a portfolio of jobs that includes heading up Canadian asset manager Brookfield Asset Management Inc.'s sustainable investment business.
Mr. Carney is also the U.N.'s special envoy on climate action and finance, in which he is tasked with persuading the world's biggest banks and investors to stump up billions of dollars to fight climate change.
Macro Advisory Partners, founded in 2013 and based in London, has a roster of European and American clients that include Apple Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Mastercard Inc. It provides strategic advice for executives on geopolitics and the economy, and counts among its senior staff and advisory board members former diplomats, financiers and business leaders.
Mr. Carney's role will be to advise clients on the global economy and monetary policy, said Nader Mousavizadeh, MAP's founding partner and chief executive.
Major central banks including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are shifting gears as they wrestle with the challenges of the pandemic and in many instances surging inflation, a complex backdrop for company executives to navigate, he said.
"We are now looking at an environment or an outlook where the Fed goes one way, the ECB goes another way and the Chinese go another way," Mr. Mousavizadeh said in an interview. To help clients understand what these shifts mean, "we can't think of anyone better than Mark," he said.
His role isn't focused on climate but rather the global economy and the intersection of geopolitics and monetary policy, he added.
Mr. Carney's other jobs, as green investor with Brookfield and an architect of a new global climate finance regime with the U.N., have opened him up to questions about potential conflicts of interest.
Mr. Carney has pushed back, saying in a 2021 interview with The Wall Street Journal that criticism of his job at Brookfield "doesn't make sense" because the company is a founding member of his climate finance alliance and is committed to reducing investments linked to carbon emissions.
Mr. Carney said in a statement Monday, "Now more than ever leaders are challenged by the complex intersection of global economic forces, politics and corporate strategy."
The role is part-time and remuneration is a private matter, Mr. Mousavizadeh said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of Washington's largest business groups, is raising concerns about Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden's nominee to become the government's top banking supervisor, after her calls for regulators to speed up the transition from fossil fuels.
The business-lobbying group called on members of the Senate Banking Committee to question Ms. Raskin about her prior statements, which include calls to use financial regulation to address threats posed by climate change. Those positions have been cheered by progressive Democrats but criticized by Republicans.
"Some of Ms. Raskin's past actions and statements have raised concerns among the U.S. business community and merit the committee's scrutiny," said Thursday's letter, which asks if it is the Federal Reserve's role "to direct capital away from certain industries that are politically disfavored."
The letter, which also urged lawmakers to scrutinize Ms. Raskin's views on other issues such as bank-merger policy, is another sign that she could face a contentious confirmation process. Still, she is unlikely to encounter the kind of industry opposition that helped torpedo the nomination of Saule Omarova, an academic Mr. Biden tapped for a separate post overseeing national banks. That fight was led by community banks that have a more favorable view of Ms. Raskin from her former stints in government.
The letter comes a week before Ms. Raskin is scheduled to testify before the Senate banking panel on Thursday along with two economists tapped for other Fed board seats: Lisa Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University, and Philip Jefferson, a professor and administrator at Davidson College in North Carolina.
If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Raskin would become the central bank's vice chairwoman of supervision, the government's most influential overseer of the U.S. banking system. She previously served as a Fed governor and as a top Treasury Department official during the Obama administration. Before that, she served as Maryland's state commissioner of financial regulation. She is a law professor at Duke University and is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.).
White House spokesman Michael Gwin said Ms. Raskin would bring unprecedented experience to the job, and had won the support of economic experts across the political spectrum.
Ms. Raskin is "firmly opposed to the Federal Reserve allocating credit by sector or choking off sectors from access to credit," said a senior administration official. Ms. Raskin supports an existing policy framework on climate risks that the Fed is pursuing and will work in with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and fellow colleagues at the Fed "to identify and mitigate risks facing our financial system," the official said.
The Fed last year built out two committees designed to monitor climate-related risks in the biggest banks and in the financial system as a whole. But Mr. Powell has been sensitive to potential political blowback, given the U.S. political divisions over how or whether to address climate change.
With a closely divided Senate, Mr. Biden needs either the support of all Democrats to confirm his nominees, or support from some Republicans to overcome holdouts from his own party.
Moderate Democrats on the Senate Banking panel who may hold the key to Ms. Raskin's nomination have yet to say whether they would support her.

Full text: One of the year's first shareholder votes on climate change points to a sharpened focus on supply chains among investors.
Costco Wholesale Corp. shareholders last Thursday voted in favor of a proposal that called on the retailer to set out plans to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with scientific recommendations to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The resolution included difficult-to-track emissions in Costco's supply chain, known as Scope 3 emissions, which the company said were the "overwhelming bulk" of its emissions.
The company's board opposed the proposal.
"While we seek and will continue to seek to influence our suppliers to reduce their emissions, we cannot directly control their actions," Costco said in its statement against the resolution.
Shareholder resolutions aren't legally binding in the U.S., but they can put pressure on companies to make changes and raise the possibility that investors could vote to remove executives if they refuse to take action.
A Costco spokeswoman said the board "will consider the vote and take further action as appropriate." She added that Costco takes climate change seriously and has a climate plan. Ahead of its shareholder meeting, Costco said it would cut emissions from its operations and energy purchases by 2% a year, which doesn't include its supply chain.
Support for shareholder proposals on greenhouse-gas emissions rose to an average of around 59% last year, compared with 25% in 2017, according to Heidi Welsh, director of the nonprofit Sustainable Investments Institute.
"With all of the majority votes, proponents are going into 2022 with a lot of momentum," Ms. Welsh said.
U.S. companies are facing 57 votes on greenhouse-gas emissions this year, though many will likely be withdrawn if investors reach agreements with management, Ms. Welsh said. Last year, there were 10 such votes.
In its statement against the resolution, Costco said transitioning to a low-carbon business model poses a "monumental challenge."

Full text: Capital gushed into climate technology and other sustainable investments in 2021. Now the market is selling off, but investors don't see a repeat of the clean-tech bust that occurred more than a decade ago.
Driving the surge: a sea change in investors' priorities and increased alarm about climate change amid devastating heat waves, storms and fires. The shift in sentiment helped push Tesla Inc.'s market capitalization above $1 trillion and made Elon Musk the richest person in the world.
Some say such frothiness signals a bubble. The Financial Crisis Observatory, a bubble-tracking outfit at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, or ETH, in Zurich, has declared it a green-energy bubble. In November, the group predicted Tesla shares would decline. They are now down more than 20%.
The 2000s saw a similar love affair with sustainable investments such as solar, wind and rechargeable-battery companies. Industry insiders call it Climate 1.0. The bubble popped in the early 2010s after the failures of solar startup Solyndra and battery maker A123 Systems.
A123 went public to great fanfare in 2009, its stock surging more than 50% on its first day of trading, raising about $380 million. It went bankrupt three years later after a string of setbacks, including a defect in one of its batteries. Solyndra never went public.
This time, investors are confident the money will keep flowing into what they dub Climate 2.0, even if there are some losses.
"We have seen a tectonic shift of capital," Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock Inc., the world's largest investment firm, said in his annual letter to CEOs earlier this month. "Actions and ambitions toward decarbonization have also increased. This is just the beginning." Overall, sustainable investments have reached $4 trillion, Mr. Fink said.
Big banks are lining up to fund efforts to curb carbon emissions. Last year at the Glasgow climate summit, most of the world's big banks as well as major investors and insurers with a combined $130 trillion in assets signed on to an effort to shift funds to investments that lower emissions.
Through the third quarter of 2021, $56.3 billion flowed into sustainable funds, up from $51.2 billion for all of 2020 and just $5.5 billion in 2018, according to Morningstar Inc. Global issuance of bonds under the Climate Bonds Standard, a framework for judging a project's sustainability, surpassed $200 billion in late 2021, according to Climate Bonds Initiative, a U.K. charity.
The 13 large-cap ESG index funds available to U.S. investors that are tracked by Morningstar posted average gains of 29.2% last year, better than the S&P 500's 27% advance, driven by hot stocks such as Tesla and solar-panel maker First Solar Inc. and technology giants such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. that have made aggressive commitments to curb emissions.
One factor potentially curbing the enthusiasm for green stocks is the performance of energy companies. The S&P energy sector rose 48% last year, rebounding from a brutal 2020, when Covid-19 ravaged the global economy. The surge has continued into the new year.
More speculative clean-technology companies, meanwhile, have taken a beating amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. And the near-term failure of President Biden's Build Back Better plan, which included more than $500 billion allocated toward climate projects, has for now removed a tailwind for the sector. Mr. Biden in a Wednesday press conference vowed to push Congress to pass parts of the plan and said the climate components of the package were a priority.
Some high-profile, speculative clean-energy stocks have been pummeled after an early wave of enthusiasm. Battery startup QuantumScape Corp. has lost about 90% since surging in late 2020. Fisker Inc., a Los Angeles electric-vehicle maker, is off more than 50% from its early 2021 peak.
At least one factor in the 2020s makes today much different than the 2000s. Auto makers around the world have committed to shifting their fleets to electric vehicles in the next few decades. That is driving huge amounts of cash into rechargeable battery companies as well as the array of commodities that make up the batteries. Prices for battery-grade lithium surged more than 400% last year, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and they jumped another 21% in the first half of January.
Gene Berdichevsky, an early Tesla employee and CEO of Sila Nanotechnologies, a Silicon Valley battery startup that raised $590 million a year ago, said he has little doubt that Climate 2.0 is here to stay because the technology is vastly improved and savvy investors are eager to take advantage.
"The odds of us getting 10 Teslas 10 or 15 years from now is very high," he said, adding that he is "seeing $5 billion climate funds pop up like weeds."

Full text: MIAMI -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis visited the coastal city of Oldsmar recently to unveil projects including sea walls and drainage systems intended to address flooding. The state is seeing rising sea levels, and Florida's environmental and economic successes are intertwined, Mr. DeSantis and other speakers said.
The Republican governor, unlike many of his Democratic counterparts, didn't use the term "climate change" or endorse specific policies aimed at combating factors that most climate scientists say are driving warming, such as greenhouse-gas emissions. He focused on responding to the effects of a warming climate.
"What I've found is people, when they start talking about things like global warming, they typically use that as a pretext to do a bunch of left-wing things," said Mr. DeSantis at the event. "We're not doing any left-wing stuff."
Governors and lawmakers in several Republican-led states, including Idaho, South Carolina and Texas, are taking a similar approach as concern about climate change increases. After natural disasters that research suggests are becoming more frequent and intense, they are taking measures such as infrastructure upgrades to mitigate flooding, wildfires and severe storms. Such moves are vital to their states' economic livelihood, they say.
A spokeswoman for Mr. DeSantis didn't respond to requests for comment.
In the past two years, the U.S. has experienced the highest annual tallies of billion-dollar weather disasters since 1980 -- when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began compiling such records -- with 22 in 2020 and 20 in 2021. The government agency has said the warming climate is a significant contributor.
Prominent Democratic governors talk frequently about climate change and back policies aimed at limiting or ending emissions. In his budget blueprint presented earlier this month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, proposed $9.1 billion to advance clean-transit initiatives to reduce emissions and $6.1 billion to help in the transition to zero-emission vehicles.
At the Oldsmar event, Mr. DeSantis outlined a proposal to dedicate more than $270 million to 76 projects aimed at bolstering defenses against rising sea levels and flooding. "We're a low-lying state, we're a storm-prone state, and we're a flood-prone state," he said.
In South Carolina, a series of catastrophic storms prompted Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to create a floodwater commission in 2018 to develop recommendations to mitigate the effects of flooding. Last year he named Ben Duncan head of a new Office of Resilience, which is managing funds to provide disaster relief and buy out flooded properties.
The office's aim is to shore up defenses in coastal and low-lying areas, not to address factors such as greenhouse-gas emissions contributing to severe flooding. "We're focused on the impacts rather than the causes," said Alex Butler, resilience planning director.
Jason Crowley, a senior program director at the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League, said an informal understanding between environmental groups and Republican elected officials to concentrate on addressing the climate crisis instead of debating its causes has paved the way for them to work on policy gains.
"We've been able to cut through that noise," he said. "In South Carolina, we've got a problem, and we've got to do something about it."
Some environmental advocates say that elected officials who don't connect the effects of climate change to the underlying causes are failing to address the problem fully. "We have to not only build resilience, but slow the pace of those impacts in the future," said Nat Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, an environmental-policy think tank.
In Louisiana, a state vulnerable to rising sea levels with significant production of oil and gas, Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards convened a task force that earlier this month presented its final draft of a climate action plan to reach net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. It sought to address both the causes and effects of climate change through proposals such as generating electricity from renewable resources.

Full text: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the Biden administration is aiming to boost U.S. economic capacity by focusing on issues such as labor supply and public infrastructure, an approach she called "modern supply-side economics."
The administration's approach is a departure from traditional supply-side economics, which seeks to promote economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, Ms. Yellen said in a speech Friday to the World Economic Forum. She pointed to a bipartisan infrastructure bill that became law in November and President Biden's proposal for social programs -- such as child care and paid family leave -- and climate-change initiatives as examples of the administration's approach to economic policy.
"Our new approach is far more promising than the old supply-side economics, which I see as having been a failed strategy for increasing growth," Ms. Yellen said. "Significant tax cuts on capital have not achieved their promised gains, and deregulation has a similarly poor track record in general and with respect to environmental policies."
Ms. Yellen's comments came at the annual meeting of world leaders in politics, finance and economic policy usually held in Davos, Switzerland. The event has been held virtually in recent years due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
"Modern supply-side economics seeks to spur economic growth by both boosting labor supply and raising productivity, while reducing inequality and environmental damage," she said.
Republicans have said the Biden economic agenda, which calls for increased federal government spending, can have negative consequences, including stoking stronger inflation, causing larger government deficits and crowding out private-sector investment.
Ms. Yellen described the Biden approach by highlighting three of the administration's policy priorities.
First, she said the U.S. needs to expand its supply of labor to increase potential economic growth. She said the administration is seeking to do that through expanded access to child care and other portions of the healthcare, education and climate plan.
Second, she said the administration aims to boost labor productivity. Previous productivity improvements driven by technological change, however, widened inequality, Ms. Yellen said. She pointed to increased spending on education and infrastructure as ways to improve productivity without widening inequality.
However, many of those policy objectives are tied to Mr. Biden's social-spending proposal, passage of which is uncertain amid disagreement in Congress over several of the plan's components. Ms. Yellen acknowledged that the plan's final details are yet to be determined.
Ms. Yellen added that projects funded through the infrastructure bill "should promote sustainable growth by addressing climate change and mitigate extreme weather events, which also have disproportionate impact on the poor."
Third, she said taxation schemes need to be leveled around the world, to avoid a "race-to-the-bottom" mentality.
The Biden administration is seeking to implement an international tax agreement that would set a global corporate minimum tax of 15% and give governments more of an ability to levy corporate income taxes on companies that sell to customers in a country without having a significant physical presence there.
Ms. Yellen on Friday said the global minimum tax would help boost U.S. economic supply by countering incentives that "have caused some companies to shift real economic activity beyond our borders."
The international tax agreement faces several roadblocks. Provisions that would implement the global minimum tax in the U.S. are part of Mr. Biden's stalled social-spending plan.
Some Republicans, meanwhile, have argued other parts of the deal must receive congressional approval, while the Treasury Department has taken a different view, contending that legislation is just one of several options available to it for implementation.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler spent his first nine months on the job sketching out ambitious plans to tighten federal regulation of Wall Street.
Now, the clock is ticking for him to implement his agenda.
With Democrats at risk of losing their thin majorities in the House and Senate after November's midterm elections, the coming months could be critical for Mr. Gensler, whom President Biden nominated last year. If Republicans win either chamber of Congress, they could move to slow Mr. Gensler's progress.
In a speech Wednesday, Mr. Gensler said his priorities for this year are to increase efficiency in the $100 trillion capital markets that the SEC oversees and to update agency rules for modern technology. A key goal is to reduce the amount of money that companies raising capital and their investors spend on fees.
Next week, Mr. Gensler said the SEC will make three proposals. The regulator will offer a rule that would enhance disclosure around private-equity funds. It also plans to issue proposals to reform the market for U.S. government debt and increase transparency around executive compensation.
"We made good progress in 2021, finalizing a handful of rules and proposing many others," he said in prepared remarks to the Exchequer Club of Washington. "We have much more to come."
The SEC has yet to issue formal proposals for the biggest policy changes the chairman has floated, including meatier disclosure requirements for public companies and a potential overhaul of stock-market plumbing.
A trading frenzy in GameStop Corp. and other meme stocks in January 2021 prompted congressional hearings and a lengthy report from the SEC division that oversees markets and broker-dealers. The record surge in initial public offerings and mergers by special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, created an unexpectedly heavy workload for staff in the division that also writes disclosure rules for companies.
One result is that the SEC has taken longer than Mr. Gensler originally expected to propose a rule requiring public companies to report more information about the risks they face from climate change.
Federal law requires agencies to seek comments from the public and study a rule's costs and benefits before finalizing major changes, a process that usually takes at least several months. That means 2022 will be a crucial year for Mr. Gensler to implement his agenda.
If Republicans gain control of the House or Senate next year, the committees that oversee the SEC would likely summon Mr. Gensler to testify more frequently at hearings on Capitol Hill. They could also threaten to cut the agency's budget or forbid it from pursuing certain policies via amendments to must-pass pieces of legislation.
"There's the very big risk that his agenda could get caught up in a change in the control of the Congress, and that would be very difficult for him and the SEC," said Hal Scott, an emeritus law professor at Harvard Law School.
Mr. Gensler's top priorities in the coming months will likely be to advance rules that Republicans have expressed the most concerns about. Aside from the climate-change initiative, these include forthcoming proposals to require more information from public companies about their workforces, and from asset managers about the criteria they use when touting the sustainability of their investment products.
Mr. Gensler didn't provide extensive details on the three proposals the SEC plans to offer next week. But he has repeatedly singled out the private-equity industry for having high and sometimes opaque fees and called for more disclosure around them. He has also outlined plans to improve the efficiency and resiliency of the market for U.S. Treasury securities. The executive-compensation rule is related to a 2015 proposal called "pay versus performance," which sought to help investors judge whether top executives' compensation is in step with the company's financial performance.
In addition, Mr. Gensler said he hopes to bring cryptocurrency trading platforms under SEC oversight this year. "If the trading platforms don't come into the regulated space, this will be another year of the public being vulnerable," Mr. Gensler told reporters after the speech. "There's real vulnerabilities here. This is a $1.9 trillion asset class that's highly speculative."
The SEC is run by a five-member panel of commissioners split between Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Biden, a Democrat, is able to pick the majority of the panel from his party, including the chair position.
With Congress, so far, unwilling to pass a bill Mr. Biden has sought to directly address issues such as climate change, the SEC and other regulators have taken on an increasingly proactive role.
Mr. Gensler said Wednesday that the timing of agenda items is a question that's "more about sequencing than prioritization."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden took office a year ago, promising to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, revive the economy and strive for unity in a nation roiled by division and crisis.
Speaking to a country battered by the pandemic and fresh off the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Biden declared, "It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And, this is certain. We will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era."
A year later, Mr. Biden's record on his promises has been mixed, with early progress passing Covid-19 relief spending and ramping up vaccinations. But by late summer he was challenged by a new coronavirus variant, rising inflation and widespread criticism over the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Mr. Biden navigated his narrow, fractious majority in Congress to get a $1 trillion infrastructure package passed but failed to unite his party around his roughly $2 trillionsocial-spending and climate-change bill. His pandemic strategy to boost vaccination rates slowed over the course of the year and took a hit when the Supreme Court tossed out his broadest-reaching mandate for American workers, and his administration has pivoted to emphasizing testing and masks amid the Omicron surge. The nation remains deeply polarized, with Mr. Biden taking a critical posture toward Republicans of late.
Heading deeper into a midterm election year, Mr. Biden's ability to regain momentum may soon dwindle, with Republicans opposed to many of his efforts and Democrats, themselves split on some of the president's priorities. With a narrow majority in the House of Representatives and a 50-50 split in the Senate, Democrats already have little room to maneuver.
Polls have shown Americans view the nation as headed on the wrong track, and the president's approval ratings have foundered in recent months, standing at 42% Wednesday, according to FiveThirtyEight's aggregation of public polls, down from 53% when he took office.
"They elected him for four years, not one year. And I think that we've gotten more done in a single year in terms of the volume of legislation passed, the size and the scope of it, than any president in history," White House chief of staff Ron Klain said.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) argued recently that Mr. Biden hadn't lived up to his promises to ease political tensions. After Mr. Biden made a fiery speech saying changes to Senate rules were needed to pass voting rights and comparing some Republican voting policies to Jim Crow segregation laws, Mr. McConnell said the president was elected to bridge divides and dial down the political temperature in the country. "President Biden has chosen to fail his own test," he said.
Here's a look at Mr. Biden's first year in office and the challenges ahead:
Covid-19
"I will take care of this, I will end this," Mr. Biden said of the virus at the final presidential debate in 2020.
A year later, the nation hasn't vanquished the pandemic, though vaccinations have allowed life to get closer to normal than at the time of his inauguration. Roughly 73% of American adults are fully vaccinated, new treatments are being approved and a $1.9 trillion relief bill passed early in Mr. Biden's term provided money to help open schools.
But Mr. Biden's July 4 declaration that the nation was "closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus" proved premature. The Delta variant took hold over the summer, and 2022 began with the highly transmissible Omicron variant triggering surging cases, a rise in hospitalizations, flight cancellations, testing shortages and school closures. There have been more than 851,000 deaths due to the virus in the U.S. since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Mr. Biden is now trying to shift his message from beating the virus to getting Americans to accept it as part of daily life. His aides say that the focus is on reducing hospitalizations and deaths and that the risks to those who are vaccinated are significantly lower. The administration is now focusing on increasing access to testing.
Economy
Mr. Biden's first year in office has seen major economic gains, even as American consumers feel the squeeze of higher prices.
The economy produced 6.4 million jobs last year, the most in a single year since the start of record-keeping in 1939. The unemployment rate saw a sharp decline, to 3.9% last month from 6.4% in January 2021.
The $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law Mr. Biden signed in March contributed to many Americans' finances improving.
Mr. Biden also signed the $1 trillion infrastructure bill into law to address aging roads and bridges and improve internet access, all of which he has argued will boost the economy and improve competition with China.
But inflation hit 7% in December, the highest level since 1982. Mr. Biden's critics have said pumping so much additional money into the economy through the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law exacerbated inflation. Republicans say rising inflation shows Mr. Biden's economic prescriptions have misfired.
Mr. Biden has taken executive action to try to unclog supply chains that have been backed up by soaring consumer demand and pandemic-related supply disruptions. The president also has noted that inflation is rising around the world.
The Federal Reserve acknowledged that its initial reading that inflation would be transitory proved overly optimistic. The central bank is on track to begin a cycle of regular interest-rate rises at its meeting in March. The challenge for the Fed will be to raise rates without being so aggressive it risks causing a recession and stoking unemployment. Mr. Biden must also deal with political fallout from voters who blame him and Democrats for higher prices.
Foreign policy
The president has worked to invigorate ties with traditional allies, attending global conferences in England and Italy and focusing on issues like the pandemic and climate change. But he surprised some allies with the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, got into a squabble with France over a new security agreement with Australia, and now faces escalating tensions with Russia and China.
Mr. Biden has defended the exit from Afghanistan, saying he would not extend a "forever war."
The Biden administration has threatened Russian President Vladimir Putin with extensive sanctions if Moscow invades Ukraine, but has expressed hope that diplomatic efforts can prevent any further escalation. So far, they have not.
After an initial tense meeting in Alaska between their foreign ministers, the U.S. has sought to find areas to work with China, most notably on climate change, but a lengthy list of differences remain on human rights, trade and technology. Washington is also seeking to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor industry in hopes of countering China economically.
Climate change
Mr. Biden has moved to rejoin the Paris climate accord and begun pursuing regulatory measures against oil-and-gas producers and other sources of greenhouse gas emissions. But some of his most significant climate measures remain in limbo as part of his roughly $2 trillion climate and social spending proposal in Congress, putting at risk the president's ability to reach his goal of cutting U.S. emissions 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030.
The U.S. helped forge an agreement among more than 190 nations to reduce emissions during the United Nations' climate talks in Glasgow last fall. But the agreement failed to include any enforcement mechanisms and essentially relied on individual nations to act on their own to reduce emissions.
The 2021 infrastructure law contained climate-related measures, including moves to bolster transport and storage of carbon dioxide. But the stalled social-spending proposal contains things like tax credits for renewable energy, energy efficiency and electric vehicles, and ways to bolster supply chains for renewable-energy technology and efforts to increase resilience to climate change.

Full text: ALTA SIERRA, Calif. -- The lights have turned back on in this community in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, more than two weeks after a large snowstorm knocked out power in the longest blackout anyone here can remember.
Alta Sierra, 60 miles northeast of Sacramento, generally gets a few inches of snow each winter. But on Dec. 27, snow piled up to 3 feet high and knocked an estimated 2,000 trees onto power lines, causing blackouts for some 200,000 customers of PG&E Corp. across four counties.
Officials with California's largest utility said they restored power to about half those customers within the first 24 hours. It took weeks to restore the rest because of issues including snow-blocked roads and toppled poles and lines on many streets.
U.S. electricity customers experienced an average of about eight hours of power interruptions in 2020, versus four in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Much of the difference stems from events such as hurricanes, wildfires and snowstorms, the agency said. Scientists and other researchers say such events are happening more frequently due to climate change.
"Generally speaking, we are in an era of amplified extreme events in terms of cost, frequency and diversity," said Adam Smith, a climatologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
In California, the power disruptions have become particularly acute in the Sierra Nevada foothills.
Alta Sierra resident Liz Shultz, 70 years old, and her husband, Dale Brevoort, 80, spent much of the 17 days they were without power bundled in a jacket trying to stay warm in a home heated only by a wood stove. "I can start swearing like a sailor or crying like a baby," Ms. Shultz said last week as she looked forward to electricity returning, which it did hours later.
In addition to blackouts caused by snowstorms, PG&E has relied heavily on pre-emptive shut-offs of power in heavily wooded areas since its equipment sparked deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018,
One of the hardest-hit areas has been Nevada County, where Alta Sierra is located.
In 2020, PG&E cut power in the area when a forecast of high winds heightened the fire risk. With multiple shut-offs like that since, many residents of Alta Sierra bought portable generators.
But Anna Wolf said it takes so much gasoline to run her generator that she and her husband turned it on only for a few hours each of the 10 days they had no power -- at a total cost of about $1,000. "I hope they figure out something because between the shut-offs in the summer and now in the winter, it's pretty unbearable," said Ms. Wolf, 45, a nurse.
Some residents and officials have called for PG&E to take steps to better prepare for extreme weather events, including putting electric lines underground. "The fact that PG&E hasn't prepared for global warming is appalling," said Patrick Johnson, a 45-year-old professional puppeteer.
PG&E officials say they prune or cut more than one million trees annually and are evaluating where undergrounding equipment can best work after breaking ground on one such project. "In the case of winter storms, we are continuously innovating to improve the accuracy of our outage prediction models and finding ways to restore power more quickly and effectively in the event of an outage," said PG&E spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo.
Residents of Alta Sierra said they were alerted to the possibility of blackouts on the morning of Dec. 27 amid the heaviest snow. "Trees started snapping and transformers started to blow," Ms. Wolf said. "It felt a little apocalyptic."
A nearby neighbor, 109-year-old Rudy Thompson, huddled beneath a sleeping bag without power the next night as his 75-year-old son, Gary, fed logs into a fireplace and ran a space heater off a generator. "Dad's house had gotten very cold and dad was very uncomfortable," said the younger Mr. Thompson, who ended up finding shelter for his father, a World War II veteran, elsewhere.
Last Wednesday, a day after power was finally restored, the father and son returned to the home. "We've had deeper snows, but it wasn't as wet," said Rudy, who has lived there since 1978.

Full text: Consumers will evolve past being simply frugal this year by becoming more aware of their spending behaviors and looking for alternatives to buy goods in less traditional ways, said market research firm Euromonitor International.
The company's annual trend report forecasts what consumers will value in the coming year and how companies should adapt.
Here are Euromonitor's predictions for 2022 consumer trends:
Supply-chain workarounds
Product shortages and disruptions have spurred consumers to use subscription services or buy secondhand to find what they want. Companies need to adapt by offering alternatives to items, said Alison Angus, head of lifestyles research at Euromonitor. Virtual queue systems present an opportunity for shoppers to get a place in line and hope they receive a product, the research firm said. Offering rental or refurbished products is another chance to keep that customer's loyalty as does enticing them with exclusive or presale items.
Environmental impact
People are looking to cut back on food waste, reduce their plastic use and recycle more. About 67% of consumers surveyed by Euromonitor stated that they tried to do something every day to have a beneficial impact on the environment. Climate change and sustainability are trends that continue to evolve from previous years, but in 2022, younger consumers will have more of an impact on their peers, parents and grandparents.
Digital seniors
The pandemic forced many people to adjust their behaviors, such as shopping for groceries online for the first time. That trend was especially popular among seniors. Now, this group of consumers wants to continue their digital use and companies should respond accordingly by offering training, support and making products that are easy to use, the research firm said. That may mean making an app or website function the same across all types of devices such as a laptop or smartphone, Ms. Angus said.
Financial awareness
The pandemic's instability caused many consumers to become more aware of their finances, as well as experiment with investing and trying out cryptocurrencies, the firm said. Companies should offer ways to educate consumers about their financial services or make products more accessible, such as lowering fees, Ms. Angus said.
Cementing priorities
Thirty-four percent of people in the latest survey preferred to spend money on experiences as opposed to products in 2021, compared with 27% in 2015. Companies need to address the change by becoming flexible to what consumers want, whether they are still working or looking for a new job opportunity. "Last year, we were talking about consumers rethinking their priorities and what their life wants to be like," Ms. Angus said. "This year . . . they're actually making the changes."
Metaverse gets real
Consumers who were forced to conduct their lives online via video chats are now changing their behavior to engage with digital worlds and communities, Ms. Angus said. Virtual concerts, sales of nonfungible tokens and dressing avatars are behaviors that consumers are tapping into, and some companies are meeting them there, the research firm said. "Any business can't afford not to be thinking about this," Ms. Angus said.
Fresh look of secondhand
Buying items secondhand is no longer stigmatized. It has become a sought-after option for consumers who want to have unique items or are shopping on a budget. Options such as gift cards or buyback programs that promote secondhand shopping behaviors from consumers are winning them over. Companies should meet this demand by addressing consumers who want to bring in older versions of items and receive a voucher or repair them in-store, Ms. Angus said.
Proximity is a plus
People who stayed in cities and didn't flee to the suburbs during the pandemic now want some of the advantages of living outside a city, such as having access to green spaces. Other people want more services closer to their homes, with many still working from home, the research firm said. Companies should aim to bring shops and services closer to them that don't require a train or car ride. "Making everything accessible to consumers within 15 minutes," Ms. Angus said.
Indulgences and self-care
Fifty-six percent of consumers expect to be happier in the next five years, the firm found. To reach that nirvana, people are buying products that help their mind and body, such as cannabis products or meditation courses. Personalized shopping experiences that can predict a consumer's needs will become a key component in reaching these people, Ms. Angus said.
Split on socialization
As the pandemic continues, consumers are becoming fragmented: those who want to go back to their normal lives and engage in social activities, and those who remain cautious. This means hybrid possibilities, such as digital visits or waiving cancellation fees, can address the needs of different consumers, the firm said. Products and services need to become multifaceted and seamless to serve this split consumer base.

Full text: World leaders made a lot of bold pledges to curb greenhouse-gas emissions at the Glasgow climate conference in November. Now, countries and companies face the prospect of making good on those promises, in the face of political and economic headwinds.
By the end of the United Nations climate summit, known as COP26, more than 150 countries had announced new or updated steps to combat global warming by 2030, according to a U.N. report titled "The Heat is On: A world of climate promises not yet delivered." Some 74 countries had made promises to eliminate or offset emissions -- known as "net zero" -- by dates ranging from 2030 to 2070.
The promises aim to limit global warming this century to the "well below" 2 degrees Celsius goal agreed to at the Paris summit in 2015. If all are met, the temperature rise could be curbed at around 1.8 degrees, analysts estimate.
Yet collectively, the major economies -- known as the Group of 20 -- aren't even on track to hit previous, weaker targets, the report noted. Climate-policy watchers say current trends, from U.S. political standoffs to soaring global prices for energy and goods, are creating added barriers.
The challenges in the U.S. "are really massive," says Robert Stavins, professor of energy and economic development at Harvard's Kennedy School. They "aren't simply economic, nor are they even technological, but are really political," he says.
Other aspirations announced at Glasgow include curbing methane emissions, developing global carbon-trading markets and halting deforestation by 2030.
Companies and other organizations are similarly under pressure to deliver on climate promises. There are "net zero" groups for universities, banks and even whiskey distilleries, which list thousands of companies and institutions pledging to neutralize greenhouse gases. Many activists say these are behind on implementation, too.
Some steps have been taken. Congress passed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill last year that contained measures to attract investment and reduce red tape for projects like pipelines to transport carbon dioxide or underground wells to store it in, both deemed necessary to reduce the amount of gas vented into the air. In December, the Environmental Protection Agency increased fuel-efficiency standards for cars. Companies like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., which each last year announced billions of dollars in investment in electric cars, have been bolstering their climate initiatives too.
But the biggest emissions-reduction impact comes from incentives for a host of activities, including capturing carbon emissions, installing methane-control equipment, and buying electric vehicles and heat pumps, says John Larsen, a lead author of a Rhodium Group study on how the U.S. might hit its 2030 targets. Those incentives are in a $2 trillion bill stalled in the Senate.
Energy analysts also say that if Democrats lose their slim majorities in Congress in the November elections, it likely would upend President Biden's climate agenda. Many analysts add that the Supreme Court could limit the authority of federal agencies like the EPA when it rules on some key cases this year.
China, the world's biggest emitter, is facing its own carbon-cutting hurdles. China depends heavily on coal for its power, and officials there argue it will take years to shift away from that energy source, particularly since its economy is still growing quickly.
COP26 was also expected to usher in an international carbon market, following a long-awaited agreement on rules for cross-border trades. But it will take years to work out the details on global trading, or harmonize standards for the hodgepodge of carbon markets operating now, experts say.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden's pick to become the Fed's top banking regulator, could face a contentious nomination process due to her support for tougher banking rules and for using financial regulation to address climate-change positions cheered by progressives but criticized by some Republicans.
Still, Ms. Raskin is unlikely to face the kind of industry opposition that helped torpedo the nomination of Saule Omarova, an academic Mr. Biden tapped last year for a separate post overseeing national banks. That fight was led by community banks who have a more favorable view of Ms. Raskin from her former stints in government.
"She's outstanding and she understands the role of the Fed governors," said Cam Fine, the former head of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade group. "She's a tough regulator, don't get me wrong, but she's very fair."
At least one top Republican, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, quickly raised concerns over her nomination. Ms. Raskin "has specifically called for the Fed to pressure banks to choke off credit to traditional energy companies and to exclude those employers from any Fed emergency lending facilities," he said in a statement.
Ms. Raskin didn't respond to a request to comment. In a statement, Mr. Biden said she "is among the most qualified nominees ever" for the Fed position.
If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Raskin would become the central bank's vice chairwoman of supervision, the government's most influential overseer of the U.S. banking system. She previously served as a Fed governor and as a top Treasury Department official during the Obama administration. Before that, she served as Maryland's state commissioner of financial regulation. She currently is a law professor at Duke University and is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.).
Mr. Biden formally nominated Ms. Raskin on Friday, along with two economists for other Fed board seats: Lisa Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University; and Philip Jefferson, a professor and administrator at Davidson College in North Carolina.
Friday's nominations were welcomed by progressive groups and Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have called for the Fed to take a tougher stance in regulating big banks and a bolder approach in addressing financial risks posed by climate change.
"With these nominees, President Biden is showing the country what a Federal Reserve standing on the side of workers and their local communities looks like," Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement.
With a closely divided Senate, Mr. Biden needs either universal support of Democrats to confirm his nominees or support from some Republicans to overcome holdouts from his own party.
Moderate Democrats on Mr. Brown's panel who hold the key to Ms. Raskin's nomination -- and who helped stop Ms. Omarova's -- didn't immediately comment on the new Fed nominees. A spokeswoman for Sen. Jon Tester said the Montana lawmaker "looks forward to reviewing their nominations." A spokeswoman for Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and a spokesman for Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema didn't respond to requests to comment.
Since leaving government, Ms. Raskin has spoken out on the need for the Fed and other federal financial regulators to more proactively address growing threats from climate-related events such as natural disasters and wildfires. Those views could attract opposition from Republicans.
"There is opportunity in pre-emptive, early and bold actions by federal economic policy makers looking to avoid catastrophe," Ms. Raskin wrote in the foreword of a report last year from the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Markets, a climate advocacy group.
In a New York Times opinion article in May 2020, Ms. Raskin was critical of broad-based emergency-lending backstops enacted by the Treasury and the Fed to assist businesses during the pandemic, because she believed they should have taken steps to prevent lending to oil-and-gas concerns.
Mr. Toomey, the ranking Republican on the Senate banking panel, said he is concerned that Ms. Raskin "would abuse the Fed's narrow statutory mandates on monetary policy and banking supervision to have the central bank actively engaged in capital allocation."
"Such actions not only threaten both the Fed's independence and effectiveness, but would also weaken economic growth," he said.
A White House official said Ms. Raskin would be tasked with looking out for risks to the financial sector and the economy, including risks from climate change. The official said she would prioritize the central bank's independence and "is not interested in expanding the mandate of the Fed."

Full text: Earth experienced one of its hottest years on record in 2021, with new reports released Thursday by two federal agencies showing that the global average surface temperature last year reached its sixth-highest level since reliable temperature record-keeping began in 1880.
The average temperature across land and sea surfaces in 2021 was 0.84 degree Celsius (1.51 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average for the 20th century, according to a report issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Last year marked the 45th consecutive year during which global surface temperatures were above average, according to the report.
A separate analysis from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said 2021 tied with 2018 for the sixth-warmest year and was hotter than all other years except 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2020. The years 2020 and 2016 share the temperature record.
Last year the U.S. recorded its hottest summer since 1936, according to the report. Parts of North America, including the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Canada, experienced record-setting temperatures during a heat wave that hit in June.
"The long-term trends are very clear," said Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the scientist who led the team that prepared the agency's report. "The last eight years have been the eight warmest."
The reports align broadly with other recent global temperature reports.
A report released Jan. 10 by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service ranked 2021 as the fifth-warmest year on record. Another climate research organization, the independent nonprofit Berkeley Earth, said 2021 tied with 2018 and 2015 as the sixth-warmest year on record in its annual analysis published Thursday.
Roughly 8% of the planet's surface, home to 1.8 billion people, experienced the highest average temperatures ever recorded in those regions, according to the Berkeley Earth report.
"Even if it is not the most extraordinary where you are, there are going to be people who are pushing up against unprecedented conditions," said Dr. Robert Rohde, a Berkeley Earth scientist who worked on the report.
Global temperature data is collected by tens of thousands of thermometers mounted on weather stations, ocean buoys and ships, Dr. Schmidt said. NASA and NOAA are among a handful of organizations that collate this data annually to estimate global temperatures.
"You don't expect a perfect increase exactly from year to year," said Russell Vose, chief of the analysis and synthesis branch at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information and one of the scientists who prepared the agency's report. "It's going to bounce around a little bit. That's why climate science tends to look at longer periods of time, decades and centuries, and that's when the real trends tend to emerge."
The long-term trend of rising global temperature is being driven by emissions of greenhouse gases, Dr. Schmidt said in reference to carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Many studies have shown that greenhouse gases released into the air by the burning of fossil fuels are the primary driver of climate change.
The 2021 global average temperature was 1.04 degrees Celsius (1.87 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average recorded between 1880 and 1900, according to the NOAA report.
Scientists often use this period as a benchmark that represents global temperatures before the Industrial Revolution and the widespread burning of fossil fuels.

Full text: The past seven years have been the warmest on record and 2021 was the fifth-hottest ever, according to new findings from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.
The report, released Monday, said 2014-2021 were the warmest years on record "by a clear margin." Temperature records from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which provides climate analytics to EU member countries, date to 1950.
While 2021 was comparatively less warm on average than other recent years, Europe had its hottest summer on record, the report said. So did the U.S., where a heat wave in the Pacific Northwest left more than 100 people dead.
The average temperature in 2021 was 0.3 degrees Celsius higher, or 0.54 degrees Fahrenheit higher, than the average between 1991 and 2020, and between 1.1 and 1.2 degrees Celsius higher than those recorded during the preindustrial era from 1850 to 1900, the latest annual findings show.
Above-average temperatures were recorded in some parts of the world, including the western U.S. and Canada, central and northern Africa and the Middle East, the report said. Researchers in Greenland observed rain at the highest point of its ice sheet last year for the first time on record.
The return of La Nina, meanwhile, contributed to below-average temperatures over parts of the Pacific Ocean, the report said. The rising global temperatures are directly correlated with climbing greenhouse-gas emissions, said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.
"Although 2021 was only the fifth-warmest year, this trend that we've seen in recent years -- and the fact that the seven warmest years ever have occurred in the last seven years -- means that we need climate action now," Dr. Burgess said.
The scientific panel advising the U.N. on climate change last year warned that some of the effects of a warming climate -- like rising sea levels and melting ice caps -- may be irreversible. Levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere have varied throughout history, but the rapid rate of change in more recent years has been driven by greenhouse-gas emissions fueled by human activity, scientists say.
Greenhouse-gas emissions continued to rise in 2021.

Full text: The abstract of "Political Legitimacy, Authoritarianism, and Climate Change," a paper by Prof. Ross Mittiga of Chile's Institute of Political Science published by the American Political Science Review, Dec. 6, 2021:
Is authoritarian power ever legitimate? The contemporary political theory literature -- which largely conceptualizes legitimacy in terms of democracy or basic rights -- would seem to suggest not. I argue, however, that there exists another, overlooked aspect of legitimacy concerning a government's ability to ensure safety and security. While, under normal conditions, maintaining democracy and rights is typically compatible with guaranteeing safety, in emergency situations, conflicts between these two aspects of legitimacy can and often do arise. A salient example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, during which severe limitations on free movement and association have become legitimate techniques of government. Climate change poses an even graver threat to public safety. Consequently, I argue, legitimacy may require a similarly authoritarian approach. While unsettling, this suggests the political importance of climate action. For if we wish to avoid legitimating authoritarian power, we must act to prevent crises from arising that can only be resolved by such means.

Full text: The Colorado suburbs of Louisville and Superior at the base of the Rocky Mountains were always thought to be safely removed from the wildfires that often burned in the foothills above.
But last week, a grasslands fire destroyed more than 1,000 homes in and around the two communities near Boulder, as powerful winds rained down embers on subdivisions that fires had never touched before.
The ember-fueled Marshall Fire, which scorched 6,067 acres on Dec. 30, is the latest example of a growing threat to similar cities in the West that aren't directly adjacent to historically fire-prone areas blanketed with forest and brush. The region's historic drought is creating conditions in which embers burn hotter, travel farther and spark parched land more easily. The drought is caused in part by climate change, according to scientists at Colorado State University's Colorado Climate Center.
Boulder County, located less than 30 miles northwest of Denver, already has some of Colorado's most robust fire-protection plans for its foothills and mountain towns. But officials acknowledge they never considered that a wildfire could spread to suburban communities along the plains below.
"This fire is certainly a game changer for us," said Seth McKinney, fire-management officer for the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.
"It redefines what we think of as the wildland-urban interface," he added, referring to areas where development meets nature and which fire researchers have long believed face the highest risk of wildfire danger.
Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said this week that authorities are still investigating the cause of the Marshall Fire, which forced tens of thousands to evacuate and has left two people missing.
Researchers and local officials say the area's drought undoubtedly played a role. Denver posted its driest and warmest period between June 1 and Dec. 29 -- the day before the fire -- since 1933, according to the Colorado Climate Center at Colorado State University. Those conditions followed an unusually wet spring that spawned a bumper crop of tall prairie grasses, which provided fuel for the fire.
Embers were flung for miles by winds that topped 100 mph, said Dan Dallas, a U.S. Forest Service supervisor and an incident commander on the fire. Some landed in subdivisions in Louisville and Superior, a suburban city and town of 21,000 and 13,000, respectively, where homes got caught in an inferno that spread to other residences.
A similar ember storm sparked by the 2017 Tubbs Fire wiped out much of the community of Coffey Park in Santa Rosa, Calif., after jumping lanes of a freeway. In 2011, embers from a large wildfire in Bastrop County, Texas, helped propel flames for miles, destroying more than 1,600 homes.
"No place is fire-safe, particularly in the West where you combine grasslands and chaparral with enduring drought," said Char Miller, professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif.
Fire researchers say communities like those burned by the Marshall Fire will have to take many of the same precautions as their mountain counterparts, such as installing ember guards on rooftops and clearing flammable materials away from homes.
Until last week, many residents in neighborhoods decimated by the Marshall Fire never worried much about wildfires reaching their front doors. On Thursday morning last week, Shelagh Turner, a 64-year-old retired teacher, had returned from running errands when a neighbor frantically told her she had 15 minutes to get out. Ms. Turner, who has lived in the same two-story, wood-frame home in Louisville for 27 years, was stunned.
Never having evacuated before, she called her daughters and asked them to Google what she should take. She grabbed her important documents and some clothes and, in a moment of confusion, loaded her skis into her Subaru. The 25-minute drive to one daughter's house took three hours on roads choked with fleeing cars, she said.
When Ms. Turner later returned to her neighborhood, she found a blackened heap of rubble where her house once stood.
"Never in a million years did I think it would be anything like this," Ms. Turner said. "I always thought I'd be safe."

Full text: Few private citizens wield more power in America today than Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock Inc. In pushing companies to embrace climate-friendly policies, that has made him a lightning rod.
The firm he runs manages some $10 trillion for pension funds, endowments, governments, companies and individuals, equal to more than 10% of the world's gross domestic product in 2020. Its funds are among the three largest shareholders in more than 80% of the companies in the S&P 500.
As steward for millions of investors, BlackRock wields vast shareholder voting power, which it uses either to back managements or to prod them in new directions.
Today, Mr. Fink is telling CEOs that companies must prepare for a scaleback of fossil fuels, and that the private sector should work with governments to do so. He warns of the disruption climate change could cause both the economy and financial markets, but sees historic investment opportunity in the energy shift.
"This is the beginning of a long but rapidly accelerating transition -- one that will unfold over many years and reshape asset prices of every type," he said in a letter to CEOs last year.
Mr. Fink's power, combined with his advocacy on a hot-button issue, has made him a flashpoint for activists, politicians and unions, both those who think BlackRock isn't doing enough and others who say it's doing too much.
Five Democratic senators wrote to Mr. Fink in 2020 saying BlackRock needed to support more shareholder resolutions to match his promises.
Tariq Fancy, an ex-BlackRock executive who runs an educational nonprofit, said Mr. Fink's message is distracting people from more-dramatic steps Mr. Fancy thinks necessary, such as carbon taxes.
"It's like giving wheatgrass to a cancer patient," he said. "The false promise of this wheatgrass serves to delay the onset of the more painful, yet necessary, solutions."
Hanging over the discussion is the argument that Mr. Fink is taking on a role better left to elected representatives.
In mid-2021, two Republican senators wrote to a large 401(k)-type plan expressing concern BlackRock was putting its CEO's views ahead of investors' needs and infusing left-leaning priorities in its voting guidelines.
Real-estate investor Sam Zell said to CNBC a few years ago: "I didn't know Larry Fink had been made God."
Mr. Fink says BlackRock acts as a voice for its investors. Mr. Fink, who describes himself as a conservative Democrat, says he isn't being political when he says investors and businesses should work alongside the government to address broad problems. When companies play a role, he says, they reduce the need for governments to engage in deficit spending to tackle the issues.
"I believe in the power of American capitalism," Mr. Fink said. "Progressives don't believe deficits matter. I do."
Mr. Fink says companies that embrace their responsibilities in crises can fulfill a role in society while delivering returns. In an interview at his horse farm in Westchester County, north of New York City, he brought up an example from the previous century.
"See what Johnson & Johnson did in World War I and II," he said. "You can call them opportunists by providing Band-Aids and gauzes and all that stuff to the military, but they were there during the crisis and stood there."
BlackRock, he says, can help investors by offering funds focused on environmental, social, and governance-minded investing, plus software to gauge climate-related risks such as drought and floods. In 2020, he told CEOs BlackRock would be increasingly disposed to vote against boards and companies that don't report their climate risks in formats BlackRock endorses.
Mr. Fink also presses firms to disclose more on the social effects of their business, such as the welfare of their workers or their local communities.
Mr. Fink's prominence partly reflects changes in finance, including a move toward index funds. That in turn has shifted the dynamic in boardrooms to give power to large asset managers.
"Treasury Secretaries and finance ministers come and go," said David Rubenstein, co-founder of Carlyle Group Inc. "They work for someone else who can fire them tomorrow and have to build what others want them to. When you are the CEO of the biggest asset manager, you don't have to."
Laurence Fink got his start at First Boston, where he ran a desk that pooled mortgages and other loans and sold pieces of the bundles. Investors snapped up safe tranches, but the riskiest stayed on the bank's balance sheet. When interest rates fell in 1986, his desk lost $100 million. Mr. Fink was forced to leave.
He founded BlackRock two years later with trader Rob Kapito and six others. It lured investors with the pitch that it had the same risk technology as big banks but without conflicts they sometimes had.
In March 2008, as the housing bubble began deflating, New York Fed President Tim Geithner and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson asked Mr. Fink for help as they scrambled to forestall a messy collapse of the bank Bear Stearns.
They wanted Bear to be absorbed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. but it worried about Bear's rapidly souring mortgage assets. The officials asked Mr. Fink: If the Fed provided financing for a newly formed company that would absorb Bear's bad assets, was there a reasonable chance the collateral could cover the loan?
Mr. Fink told them taxpayers wouldn't lose money over the long run. U.S. officials moved the bad assets to a limited-liability company financed by the Fed so JPMorgan could be comfortable taking over Bear, which it did. BlackRock helped select which assets went into the LLC portfolio and oversaw it for the government. That program ultimately delivered gains for taxpayers.
"Larry was perfect for this job," Mr. Paulson said. "No one understood the market better."
Roughly a year later, BlackRock got a chance to acquire Barclays PLC's money-management business. Mr. Fink held his first grandchild in his arms in June 2009 and then went to the office for an all-nighter to raise the final $3 billion to buy Barclays Global Investors.
The deal gave BlackRock an arsenal of index-mirroring funds with low fees. It also gave Mr. Fink a megaphone. He decided the firm needed to be a counterweight to activist investors who target companies. "There needed to be a louder voice for long-term investors," he said.
BlackRock in 2012 released the first of Mr. Fink's annual letters to CEOs. He uses these to prod, scold and push firms to disclose more about how they provide for workers, the environment and the community. "Climate risk is investment risk," Mr. Fink has written. Also, "Profits and purpose are inextricably linked."
For much of his career, Mr. Fink was known for arriving at the office by 6 a.m., while traveling two weeks a month. He now starts his workday about 7:30 following a session with a trainer. His back feels the toll from years of desk work, said Mr. Fink, who is 69.
BlackRock's board and executives, in succession planning, recently asked Mr. Fink to continue as CEO. He said he is planning to retire in no more than five years.
As a CEO, he can be impatient, colleagues say, and hates to be beaten. When Fidelity Investments in 2018 shook the money-management business by offering zero-fee index funds, Mr. Fink called a meeting and told his teams to pick up the phone and put BlackRock's name in front of clients.
"Stop tripping over your d--ks," he demanded, according to several people at the meeting.
On March 18, 2020, with Covid-19 spreading, stocks falling and bond trading seizing up, Mr. Fink got another summons to Washington.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin organized a meeting, hoping the conversation would make clear to then-President Donald Trump that a government response to the pandemic needed to be big. The group discussed how much the government should spend to keep the economy afloat. "Trillions," Mr. Fink said.
The government soon unveiled a roughly $2 trillion package, part of it to prop up financial markets. A formal role for BlackRock wasn't discussed at the meeting, but soon the Fed hired a BlackRock unit to help it pump money into corporate bonds -- a first for the central bank -- and other markets. The financial markets stabilized.
Part of BlackRock's assignment was helping the Fed buy bond exchange-traded funds, including BlackRock's own. In the rush to avert a deep recession, the Fed didn't bid out the job but just hired BlackRock.
The firm estimates it lost money on the work, given the resources consumed, said people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Fink has cut back his travel in the pandemic but invites one or two CEOs a week to his Manhattan townhouse for dinner. He says they order take-out and do the dishes afterward. He spends Thursday evenings to Sunday afternoons at his farm, where he has installed a desk in a barn filled with American folk art.
There, he has planted some 400 American chestnuts and other trees. He gets excited as he identifies each species.
Through the day, the duck ringtone on his cellphone goes off. When company executives phone to try to persuade him how to handle proxy votes, Mr. Fink hands them to a BlackRock group that interacts with companies. Though he is in discussions on rules guiding the firm's votes, he removes himself from decisions on any one vote.
In 2017, Mr. Fink was part of a group of CEOs serving as a sounding board for former President Trump on business policies. After the racially motivated and violent clash in Charlottesville, Va., that year, Mr. Fink huddled with another member, PepsiCo Inc.'s then-CEO Indra Nooyi, over what both considered Mr. Trump's insufficient condemnation of those behind the violence, and the two decided to step down from the group. Some other CEOs arrived at the same position, leading the president to dissolve it.
Three former BlackRock employees have key positions in the Biden administration, including the firm's former head of sustainable investing. Mr. Fink says he has never raised money for any presidential candidate and has donated to both Republicans and Democrats over the years.
BlackRock published a study in 2019 on how it said climate change and events related to it affect the municipal-bond market and how extreme weather threatens infrastructure. The firm forecast that 58% of U.S. metro areas would suffer gross domestic product losses of at least 1% over the next decades if they didn't prepare for climate risks.
With its index funds, BlackRock is locked into investing in all kinds of companies, from coal miners to wind farms. In portfolios run by active managers, the firm has scaled back thermal coal exposure, as it pledged to, and said last year it would flag companies that posed significant climate risk for potential selling.
Addressing a meeting in Venice of leaders from the Group of 20 nations last July, Mr. Fink urged ministers to create more private-public partnerships for renewable-technology investments.
One idea he pushed was authorizing the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to shoulder the first losses on sustainable-energy projects, so other investors would feel safe putting in money. It was an echo of how the U.S. in 2008 fenced off the worst Bear Stearns holdings to encourage JPMorgan to take over the firm.
In the lead-up to the Glasgow climate summit, Mr. Fink asked other finance CEOs to press government leaders to create incentives for investors to fund alternative-energy sources. He urged other executives to drop calls for carbon taxes, saying their cost would trigger a backlash, according to people familiar with the matter.
He also helped steer debates among finance executives on steps needed for the steel, aviation and oil-and-gas sectors to reduce carbon emissions, and on how society should account for the growing pile of assets that would be deemed worthless along the way.
"Society is trying in certain instances to pressure companies to do more, including at times what ought to be the role of government," said Evan Greenberg, the CEO of insurance company Chubb Ltd., who has gone fly-fishing with Mr. Fink.
He added: "I believe Larry chose consciously to approach it as an opportunity, rather than something he is expected to do."

Full text: It's New Year's resolution season, and don't be surprised if politicians world-wide settle into the same informal pledge: Talk as little as possible about climate change in 2022. They've gotten a head start on that resolution, working hard at it even before Friday night's socially distanced parties begin.
The biggest, most entertaining and also most telling climb-downs are happening in the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson in October unveiled an ambitious policy program to get Britain to net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions by 2050. It was Mr. Johnson's public-relations coup ahead of the COP26 global climate conference he hosted in Glasgow. It also was unusual in its honesty about what such environmental ambitions will cost individual households and businesses -- a point politicians usually avoid for all the obvious reasons.
Sure enough, the backtracks and U-turns began before that document was written. The most controversial component of Mr. Johnson's net-zero boondoggle concerns an attempt to steer households away from the gas boilers on which 86% of them rely for hot water and central heating.
Mr. Johnson said in October he hopes that by 2035 the government will be able to phase out installation of new natural-gas heating units. That represents a step back from earlier plans to require carbon-efficient heat pumps in new homes as early as 2025, and the extended deadline still faces stiff opposition stemming from the high cost of heat pumps.
And "boiler-gate" is only the beginning of the reversals great and small. Among the great, count the delay to next year (at least) of a formal public-comment process for a beefed-up emissions-trading system. One reason for the holdup, the Telegraph reports, is that Mr. Johnson's colleagues can't agree on which corners of the economy should become newly subject to the rules -- although apparently they now agree that car and home fuels should be excluded.
Among the smaller reversals, the Transport Department in November backtracked from a plan to require small businesses with parking lots on their premises to install electric-vehicle charging points. The proposed rules governing other structures such as new housing, residential conversions, and new mixed-use developments are so porous as to resemble a well-aerated Swiss cheese, with cost limitation emerging as the primary concern. This difficulty installing charging stations augurs the collapse, sooner or later, of Mr. Johnson's announced plan to ban new internal-combustion cars by 2030.
Nor is this only a British phenomenon. Set aside the brouhaha surrounding green provisions in Democrats' Build Back Better spending extravaganza in America. Some of the most surprising climate realism is now emerging in Europe.
French President Emmanuel Macron faces a campaign for re-election in 2022, and he learned the hard way in 2018 how higher fuel prices can trigger debilitating popular protests. His solution is to double down on traditional French industrial policy, especially concerning support for nuclear power. At Mr. Macron's behest, the European Commission in Brussels may be on the verge of including both nuclear and natural gas on a list of environmentally friendly energy sources eligible for "green investment" from governments and private investors. Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg is dismayed, but she also doesn't need to persuade anyone to vote for her.
Even in Germany politicians are starting to change course. Households and businesses there pay some of the highest electricity prices in Europe in service of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's aggressive shift toward renewable power. German voters believe in these goals more than most other electorates, and they elected the environmentalist Green Party into the new governing coalition in September.
But even in Germany there appears to be a limit. The deal cementing the coalition between the Greens, the larger Social Democrats and the smaller Free Democrats hedges its climate commitments. A coal phase-out will happen ideally by 2030 -- with the newly inserted word "ideally" blunting Green ambitions by marking the whole project as tentative. Carbon neutrality will wait for 2045, if it ever comes, and more-aggressive limits on aviation and automotive emissions are missing.
The net-zero gimmick will be with us for a long while yet, alas. The green true believers (or are they bitter clingers?) are busy devising rear-guard actions by which to insulate environmentalism from real-world political pressures, not least by enlisting gullible or cynical titans of finance to do via pension-fund investment allocations what can't be done honestly via legislation. The political class remains rhetorically wedded to its earlier foolhardy promises, and the media is too enamored of reality-detached activists such as Ms. Thunberg.
All the smarter then for politicians to resolve to discuss the matter as little as possible in the year ahead. As starving the atmosphere of carbon dioxide becomes a political liability, starving the issue of political oxygen will become the electoral tactic of choice.

Full text: Presidents aren't issued magic wands upon taking their job, as any occupant of the Oval Office could tell you. Certainly as he nears the end of a tough first year, President Biden could testify to that.
But let's imagine he could have a magic wand for a day, and use it to salvage what he most wants out of his big Build Back Better package of social and climate-change programs. What would he pick?
The question is relevant because the president, his staff and his party in Congress find themselves needing badly to pick priorities as 2021 draws to a close. They don't have the votes to pass the president's plan in the Senate as is, certainly not after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin publicly declared his opposition, robbing Democrats of the 50th vote they would need to squeeze it into law.
Mr. Manchin objects to the overall cost and funding of Build Back Better as currently structured -- and specifically to changes the House made that added to the price tag of the $1.75 trillion framework President Biden proposed after consultations with the West Virginia Democrat.
It's now clear, as it probably should have been all along, that Mr. Biden can't please everybody within his party.
So if he just wanted to please himself, here's what he might choose to salvage:
Federal help for child care
Mr. Biden talks fondly of this idea, in part because it punches two of his hot-button themes: helping preserve the "dignity of work" for working-class families and making America more competitive.
The Build Back Better framework called for ensuring that families of four earning less than $300,000 a year would pay no more than 7% of their income on child care for children under 6 years old. Working parents would get funds to cover child care based on a sliding scale, and states would get money to expand access to child-care programs.
Why does that matter so much to Mr. Biden? Everybody's views are shaped by their own experiences, and Mr. Biden encountered the cost of child care personally when, as a new senator, his wife was killed in a car crash. He was left to commute to Washington every day from his Delaware home -- and leaned on his family to provide full-time child care for his sons. He now talks of how hard it would have been for him to handle his new job in Congress if he hadn't had that family help, and instead would have had to pay for professional child care.
Beyond that, help for child care enables Mr. Biden to cite a phrase he still uses to describe his plans, but that other Democrats seem to have forgotten: making America more competitive. In Mr. Biden's original construct from his presidential campaign, a big justification for his social agenda was supposed to be providing government help that would make American businesses as well as workers more competitive in their struggle with global competitors in China and elsewhere that get a lot of government help.
That idea has largely been lost as Democratic progressives frame their proposals as attempts to extract money from corporations rather than work with them, but Mr. Biden still embraces the idea. And at a time when the business sector is plagued by worker shortages, making it easier for parents, particularly working mothers, is an idea he can frame as a competitiveness initiative.
Reducing the cost of prescription drugs
Build Back Better would allow the federal government to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs covered by Medicare, a provision the pharmaceutical industry is fighting against, hard.
The bill also would specifically limit the rapidly rising prices diabetics pay for insulin. That provision would be particularly beneficial to more than three million senior citizens who get insulin through Medicare's Part D program.
Build Back Better has other measures designed to hold down drug costs, which are controversial because pharmaceutical companies charge they would end up reducing drug availability and choice. But Mr. Biden speaks of them with passion.
Fighting climate change
It's fair to say that Mr. Biden is a late arrival to his party's quest for government programs to battle climate change, but he seems to have arrived with some of the zeal of a convert.
Whether this is because of genuine conviction or simply a realization of the prevailing winds within his party is impossible to know. But in any case, it's noteworthy that, before things came to a halt, Mr. Biden and Mr. Manchin actually seemed to have worked out an agreement on climate-change provisions in Build Back Better, despite Mr. Manchin's roots in a coal-mining state and his ties to the coal industry.
Having reached that agreement in 2021, it's fair to assume Mr. Biden wouldn't want to give it up in 2022.

Full text: California's cap-and-trade system, designed to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, is being undermined by forest fires caused in part by climate change, according to scientists.
California's cap-and-trade allows businesses to offset carbon emissions by purchasing a limited number of credits, most of which are used to protect trees that store carbon dioxide from being cut down. California and a group of East Coast states were the first to develop such a system in the U.S.
But over the past two years, wildfires along the West Coast have consumed as many as 6.8 million metric tons of stored carbon dioxide in forests enrolled in the program, according to preliminary estimates by the Climate Trust, a Portland, Ore., nonprofit that manages carbon offset acquisition projects.
That is more than one-fifth of the 29 million tons California regulators have set aside so far to potential losses due to wildfires or insects over a full century. The state's Air Resources Board designated that amount as a buffer for the program, which currently aims to preserve a total of 156 million tons of forest carbon credits.
Researchers now warn the state's stockpile of carbon dioxide credits is rapidly depleting because of the growing size and intensity of wildfires. The two biggest wildfires in California history have burned in the past two years and 14 of the top 20 took place over the past decade.
"These risks are pretty big, and they are probably much larger than what the buffer pool currently has," said William Anderegg, associate professor of biology at the University of Utah.
A spokesman for the California Air Resources Board said the program is protected in part by the fact that California businesses can buy offsets in forests in 29 states, from Alaska to Maine. He also said the size of the forest buffer will increase as more projects are added.
The agency "will use the most up-to-date information and peer-reviewed science to ensure we are continually improving how the . . . program contributes to California's overall climate effort," spokesman Dave Clegern wrote in an email. Mr. Clegern said the board's protocol includes requirements that carbon forestry projects undertake activities to reduce fire risk and become more resilient, such as making sure to keep a healthy mix of tree species and ages.
California's cap-and-trade program creates a budget of air-emission allowances that companies can buy and sell to give them the right to pollute. As those allowances shrink over time, companies can buy offset credits to their emissions, such as in forests, to let them generate more pollution than they would otherwise be allowed. The credits -- equaling a metric ton of carbon dioxide each -- are part of California's goal to reduce greenhouse-gas output in the state 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 to combat climate change.
Researchers say some of the biggest damage to forest credits is in Oregon. In 2020, the 204,469-acre Lionshead Fire heavily damaged a carbon capture forestry project there, resulting in potential loss of more than one million credits, according to researchers at CarbonPlan, a nonprofit focused on the scientific integrity of climate projects. Last summer also in Oregon, the 413,717-acre Bootleg Fire damaged another carbon project, potentially wiping out another one million credits there, CarbonPlan researchers estimate.
During 2021, CarbonPlan scientists calculate about 158,000 acres of forests enrolled in California's offsets program were burned.
So far, air board officials say two projects have had to be pulled out of the buffer pool due to fire damage, totaling 1.1 million credits. But they acknowledged more may be removed.
Defenders of cap-and-trade say despite the damage done by wildfires, the program still provides substantial benefits in the fight against climate change. "No system is perfect, but time is ticking and we need to be leveraging all the tools we can right now," said Julius Pasay, interim executive director of the Climate Trust.

Full text: The Biden administration wants to spend billions on electric-vehicle subsidies and charging stations because, as Vice President Kamala Harris put it in a Dec. 13 speech, "climate change has become a climate crisis and it demands urgent action." But rushing to replace gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles would hand the keys to the American transportation sector to China, given Beijing's near-monopoly on rare-earth elements like neodymium and dysprosium, which are used in the high-output motors of most electric vehicles.
The Journal reported Dec. 3 that the Chinese government is consolidating assets from state firms to create a new global champion called the China Rare Earth Group. The state-run Global Times quoted a manager at a state-owned rare-earth enterprise based in Ganzhou: "The new company will enforce stricter rules on the production quantity as well as the export volume of rare earths, which may also drive up prices."
The White House's Dec. 13 press release on charging stations, which includes a section on electric-vehicle batteries, mentions the need to increase domestic production of lithium to bolster the "battery supply chain," but it mentions neither rare earths nor China.
In May, the International Energy Agency reported that an electric-vehicle motor requires "upwards of 1 kilogram," or more than 2 pounds, of rare-earth elements. The same report found that China controls about 85% of the global supply of those elements and that the "geographical concentration of production" of critical minerals -- including rare earths, lithium, copper and cobalt -- "is unlikely to change in the near term."
Even if the U.S. could increase quickly the mining of rare earths -- an unlikely prospect given the difficulty of gaining permits for new mining operations -- the IEA explains that processing rare earths "often generates toxic and radioactive materials" that can leak into groundwater, and that "this has been a serious issue in China."
Some auto makers, including Nissan and BMW, have developed electric-vehicle drive trains that reduce or eliminate the need for rare earths. But even if the auto industry doesn't need them, the wind-energy industry does. According to the IEA, offshore wind turbines require as much as 500 pounds of rare earths per megawatt of installed capacity, including some 400 pounds of neodymium. Those are big numbers considering that the Biden administration wants to deploy 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The IEA predicts that the global wind-energy industry's need for rare earths "is set to more than triple by 2040."
The punch line here is obvious: Since the 1973 oil embargo, U.S. policy makers have decried America's dependence on foreign oil to fuel our transportation sector. But now, in the name of climate change and the much-hyped "energy transition," the U.S. is positioning itself to be dependent largely on China for rare earths, and it will do so at the same time that the U.S. and China are increasingly at odds over the origins of Covid-19, Taiwan sovereignty, control of the South China Sea, and genocide and crimes against humanity against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, including forced labor to produce polysilicon for solar panels.
By forcing electric vehicles into the market, the U.S. will trade reliance on domestically produced gasoline and diesel fuel for reliance on Chinese neodymium, terbium and dysprosium. What a lousy trade.

Full text: From wine to sneakers, more consumer products are sporting labels touting their carbon-neutral credentials. How the labels will pay off with consumers remains to be seen.
Climate Neutral, a nonprofit certification outfit for products pitched as carbon neutral, says it has given its seal of approval to 338 brands, some of which use it on labels or packaging, up from just four in 2019. The companies it endorsed include sneaker maker Allbirds Inc., Lubanzi Wines of South Africa and outdoor brand Recreational Equipment Inc., known as REI.
U.K. nonprofit Carbon Trust and consulting firm Natural Capital Partners are among those offering competing carbon-neutral certificates.
There is no shared definition of carbon neutrality, but the term generally means a company acquired enough carbon offsets -- credits representing emissions averted or removed from the atmosphere -- to equal its operational emissions over a given period. Carbon neutral is different from "net zero," which requires companies to reduce emissions over the long term and rely less on offsets.
But not everybody follows the nuances of climate jargon.
"Most consumers don't know what the hell carbon-neutral is," said Suzanne Shelton, chief executive of sustainability marketing firm Shelton Group, which has worked with dozens of Fortune 500 companies. A 2020 Shelton Group survey found that just 35% of U.S. respondents could confidently explain what a carbon footprint was.
Ms. Shelton said the proliferation of labels might add to the confusion, at least until one label becomes dominant.
"I think we are going to see a fair amount of greenwashing because one company is going to justify carbon-neutral in this way and another company is going to go, 'No, that doesn't count,'" Ms. Shelton said.
But she said certifications that become ubiquitous, such as USDA Organic, are one of the main ways consumers judge whether products are green. "I'm not going to advise Corporate America to stop using those words because I also think once upon a time we didn't know what a gigabyte was or an HDMI cable," she said of carbon-neutral labels.
Among the companies planning to make carbon neutrality part of its marketing pitch is Mars Inc.
Kevin Rabinovitch, Mars's chief climate officer, said the company's research points to a general preference for eco-conscious options. He acknowledged that climate-change-related advertising can be confusing, and that even people who say they want to buy environmentally friendly products often don't. Still, he said consumers will get the basic idea.
"Being carbon-neutral is better than not being carbon-neutral," Mr. Rabinovitch said.
The McLean, Va., company plans to market its namesake candy bar in the U.K., Canada and Ireland as carbon-neutral by 2023. Some lines of its Royal Canin dog food will carry carbon-neutral certification at the start of 2022, with all lines expected to be certified by 2025. Depending on how consumers react to the initial campaigns, he said, other Mars brands could follow.
Some consumer-goods makers have started adding estimates of a product's carbon emissions to their packaging. Mr. Rabinovitch said it was harder to see how a consumer would engage with that. Carbon neutrality is "a much easier, simpler idea for people to wrap their head around," he said. "Even if people don't necessarily understand the details of the math, [it] seems to be a better intuitive concept."
Mars has a target to achieve net-zero emissions across its business by 2050. Mr. Rabinovitch said carbon neutrality for specific products can be achieved more quickly.
"The thing that makes carbon-neutral easier than net zero is that you don't have to have delivered all of your [emissions] reductions," he said. "The thing that makes it harder is that you have to buy a lot of carbon credits in the short term."
Mr. Rabinovitch said Mars plans to offset the emissions generated across the Mars bar's life cycle, from raw materials to the disposal of the wrapper. It will buy nature-based offsets from projects such as reforestation, and could use novel carbon-removal technologies in the future if they are cost-effective, he said.
Climate Neutral is one of the most widely used certifiers. To get its seal of approval, companies with more than $100 million in yearly sales must show they have emission-cutting plans that align with the targets of the Paris agreement on climate change, as well as offsetting all their emissions, including those from their suppliers and the use of their products.

Full text: The Biden administration faces a looming decision on solar-energy tariffs that pits its goal of combating climate change against its ambition to wrestle high-tech manufacturing supply chains from China.
Early next year, U.S. taxes on imported solar panels are set to expire after a four-year run. Many climate activists and solar-energy users want the administration to scrap the tariffs, saying they make solar panels needlessly expensive.
"The solar industry is literally trying to save the planet," the Solar Energy Industries Association, which represents companies that install and use solar panels, recently told the Biden administration. "Tariffs only stand in the way by slowing growth of solar deployment and undermining efforts to replace fossil fuels with cleaner renewable energy."
U.S. manufacturers are petitioning to extend the tariffs for another four years. They say without them, the U.S. will effectively cede the business of making solar panels to Chinese companies, which already dominate key portions of the solar supply chain.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, whose office administers the tariffs, hasn't taken a position and declined to comment for this article.
The tiff is the latest evidence of tension between the administration's economic goals and the long-term task of tackling climate change, which President Biden has called the world's greatest challenge. This fall, Mr. Biden's pledge to cut emissions from gasoline consumption ran up against a near-term need to increase oil production amid rising prices.
In the solar market, the economic goal is building a resilient supply chain independent of China, while boosting U.S. manufacturers in their effort to win a greater slice of an expanding pie. The Energy Department estimates 40% of U.S. electricity could be solar as soon as 2035, and the industry could "employ as many as 1.5 million people -- without raising electricity prices."
Relying entirely on tariff-free goods from China may be the cheapest option to achieve that outcome. Advocates for tariffs say that view is shortsighted, as it may make it impossible for an American solar supply chain to compete.
"We have to keep the tariffs to allow the domestic industry to get further scale and further capacity," said Michael Stumo, chief executive of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group of manufacturing, agricultural and union organizations that supports the use of tariffs to boost domestic U.S. manufacturing and reduce dependence on China.
This month the International Trade Commission, a U.S. government body that makes recommendations on tariff policy, issued a 586-page report to Mr. Biden endorsing a continuation of the solar tariffs, which expire Feb. 6. It cited evidence that removing the tariffs could cause "serious injury" to attempts to revive American solar manufacturing.
Considering the climate impacts wasn't part of its remit.
Many industries have disappeared from the U.S. and moved to China or other countries, but the structure of the solar market is unique.
Solar panels are made in four steps. The raw material, polysilicon, is molded into ingots -- large, rod-shaped crystals. Ingots are sliced into paper thin wafers, which are processed into solar cells.Finally the cells are assembled into the familiar modules, or panels, that wind up on roofs.
The U.S. has no significant capacity to produce wafers or cells, having seen a nascent domestic industry wiped out during the past decade.
But a number of American factories are capable of producing polysilicon, which is also used in semiconductors, and a handful of struggling U.S. manufacturers still make solar modules.
This dynamic -- where U.S. companies can perform the first and last steps in the process, but not the middle two -- leads some analysts to believe it could be possible to reconnect a wholly American supply chain.
"The U.S. has a competitive advantage in that it has polysilicon capacity," said Edurne Zoco, executive director for clean energy technology at IHS Markit. "Yes, it's possible, but you need very clear policy support that goes beyond one electoral cycle."
Mamun Rashid, chief executive of Auxin Solar, a Silicon Valley-based module manufacturer, says his company is prepared to open new U.S. facilities. He calls tariffs an "absolutely necessary piece."
"We have to do what's right for the climate, I get that," Mr. Rashid said. "But what happens if we decimate the solar supply chain? We're already one of the last alive . . . and what happens if China turns off the faucet on that supply?"
Another U.S. company, Suniva Inc., operated a solar cell factory in Norcross, Ga., until 2017, when the company went into bankruptcy. Now out of bankruptcy, Suniva has said it could bring the facility back if tariffs were extended.
Critics of the tariffs aren't convinced, noting that many industries rely on global supply chains and that the tariffs have been in place for four years without leading to a revival.
Total solar jobs have declined since the tariffs took effect, according to estimates from the National Solar Jobs Census.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden's ambitious climate-change plans were thrown into doubt after West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said Sunday he wouldn't support his party's roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package.
The wide-ranging legislation includes more than a half-trillion dollars in climate-related spending, the largest such investment in U.S. history. The White House has said the measures would help the U.S. meet Mr. Biden's goal of cutting U.S. emissions 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030.
Without the climate-related provisions in the legislation, Mr. Biden faces a narrower path toward meeting his target, according to independent analysts. Failure to meet the target could undermine U.S. efforts to take a leadership role in international climate negotiations, complicating the Biden administration's campaign to pressure other countries to deliver more-ambitious plans to reduce emissions.
The legislation that passed the House last month included about $555 billion in spending on a range of climate measures, including tax credits for renewable energy, energy efficiency and electric vehicles; efforts to boost resilience to the effects of climate change, such as wildfires and droughts; and provisions to grow U.S. supply chains for renewable-energy technology. The bill also included a fee on emissions of methane -- a gas that traps roughly 85 times as much heat as carbon dioxide -- as well as funding to help facilities lower methane emissions.
Democrats removed a key proposal to which Mr. Manchin objected: a $150 billion program aimed at pushing utilities to generate more electricity from clean sources.
Mr. Manchin, a coal-state Democrat, criticized the climate-related provisions in the bill on Sunday, claiming that they would make the electric grid less reliable and increase dependence on foreign supply chains. "The energy transition my colleagues seek is already well under way in the United States of America," he said.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki called Mr. Manchin's assertions inaccurate. "Build Back Better will produce a job-creating clean-energy future for this country -- including West Virginia," she said Sunday. She criticized Mr. Manchin for opposing the legislation and said the White House would press him to reverse his position.
A White House official said the president's senior climate advisers believe there are multiple pathways to reach Mr. Biden's 2030 climate goals.
Some Democrats held out hope that Mr. Manchin would re-engage in negotiations on a narrower version of the legislation that could include some climate provisions.
"Major climate and clean-energy provisions of the Build Back Better Act have largely been negotiated, scored for 10 years, and financed. Let's pass these provisions now. We cannot let this moment pass," Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.) said on Sunday.
Independent analysts have said Mr. Biden can meet his 2030 emissions-reduction target through a mix of regulatory, state and legislative actions. Private-sector companies also have taken steps on their own to lower emissions, but deeper reductions could require additional rules and standards, analysts said.
Without action from Congress, Mr. Biden could still meet the target, analysts said. But doing so would require more-ambitious state and executive-branch actions such as tighter federal rules on power plants, vehicles and industrial emissions, according to Anand Gopal, executive director of strategy and policy at Energy Innovation, an independent research firm. "It's not beyond the realm of possibility," Mr. Gopal said on Sunday. "But it's going to be hard, no question."
Congressional action had long been seen as crucial for meeting the 2030 target. "If Congress fails to act, the 2030 target may be in jeopardy," Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, said in an October report.
Combined, the infrastructure bill, which Mr. Biden signed into law last month, and the broader social-spending and climate legislation would accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and reduce emissions. The tax credits in the social-spending legislation also would help reduce the costs of complying with additional federal and state emissions-reduction efforts, according to the Rhodium report, easing the transition away from fossil fuels.
"Without the cost-reduction assistance of congressional actions, federal and state leaders will face higher technical and political hurdles as they pursue the ambitious policies required to get to the 50-52% target," the report says.
Absent additional action, U.S. emissions are currently on track to be about 17% to 25% below 2005 levels in 2030, well short of Mr. Biden's target, according to the Rhodium report.
The Biden administration is planning new executive-branch-level efforts to reduce emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency recently announced plans to tighten regulations on oil and natural-gas production to reduce leaks of methane. The EPA also is expected to complete new emissions rules for cars and trucks -- proposed in August -- by year's end. Mr. Biden also has promised more stringent greenhouse-gas emissions limits for power plants, but a formal proposal is still forthcoming.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) said he would oppose his party's roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package, likely dooming the centerpiece of President Biden's economic agenda as currently written.
"This is a 'no' on this legislation," Mr. Manchin said on Fox News Sunday. "I have tried everything."
Democrats have spent months drafting and revising the package, called "Build Back Better," to win Mr. Manchin's support, which they need to pass the bill through the 50-50 Senate.
In his Fox News appearance and in a written statement, Mr. Manchin reiterated many of the concerns he has expressed about the bill, including its possible effect on inflation and how the cost was calculated.
While Mr. Manchin has raised those concerns for months, his statement that he would vote against the bill renewed the bill's peril, and kicked off a scramble among Democrats in Washington to try to salvage their efforts and pass an alternative bill addressing climate change and the social safety net.
Mr. Manchin, who spoke with Mr. Biden multiple times last week about the bill, said that he couldn't explain a "yes" vote to the people he represents in West Virginia. "I can't get there," Mr. Manchin said on Fox News.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a blistering statement that Mr. Manchin's comments were inconsistent with his recent negotiations with Mr. Biden. Ms. Psaki said that last week Mr. Manchin had submitted to Mr. Biden an outline of provisions he could support in the legislation, in a step that Ms. Psaki said would be the basis of future negotiations. That called for roughly $1.75 trillion in spending, according to people familiar with the offer.
"If his comments on Fox and written statement indicate an end to that effort, they represent a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the president and the senator's colleagues in the House and Senate," Ms. Psaki said.
Mr. Manchin didn't personally give the White House or top Democrats on Capitol Hill advance notice about his comments Sunday, people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Manchin's stance could derail Democrats' efforts to translate their threadbare congressional majorities and control of the White House into a wide-ranging legislative package before the midterm elections, in which Republicans are favored to win control of the House. The roughly $2 trillion bill that the House passed earlier this year seeks to create a universal prekindergarten program, subsidize child care costs, lower prescription-drug costs and offer tax credits for reducing carbon emissions -- all while raising taxes on corporations and very high earners.
At the center of Mr. Manchin's criticism of the legislation is Democrats' decision to fund a host of programs on a temporary basis, a choice the party made to make progress on a series of policies while keeping the overall price tag of the bill down. Mr. Manchin has repeatedly criticized that design, calling it a budget gimmick aimed at disguising the cost of the legislation because many Democrats have hoped to later extend the provisions in future bills.
In the Fox News interview, Mr. Manchin said Democrats should focus on funding a smaller number of programs for longer. "So if you're going to do something and do it -- pick what our prized priorities are, like most people do in their families or their businesses, and you fund them for 10 years, and you make sure they deliver the services for 10 years," Mr. Manchin said.
Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House began eyeing how -- and if -- they could alter the package to meet Mr. Manchin's objections, according to people familiar with the early efforts. Cutting additional programs from the bill, and instead choosing a select few to fund for the long term, will be a politically difficult task for Democrats, pitting advocates for various party goals against each other for a slice of the bill's funding.
Some aides said they expected the roughly $550 billion in climate provisions to remain in the mix, along with expanded subsidies for healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Manchin has suggested to Mr. Biden that Democrats drop an extension of the expanded child tax credit, according to a person familiar with the talks, though the child tax credit has become a central priority for many members of the party.
Rep. Suzan DelBene (D., Wash.), chairwoman of the moderate New Democrats coalition, said Sunday that the party should choose a smaller set of programs to fund in the bill, listing the child tax credit, ACA subsidies and climate programs as worthy goals. Her statement was tweeted by White House officials, including chief of staff Ron Klain.
Still, it remained unclear that Mr. Manchin would ultimately support such a bill, and Democrats were despondent about the possible demise of much of the party's agenda.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said Mr. Manchin "doesn't have the guts to stand up to powerful special interests." He urged Democrats to bring the bill to the Senate floor and force Mr. Manchin to vote against it.
Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.), a centrist who faces a competitive re-election, said that Democrats needed to find a compromise.
"After months of negotiations, one Democratic U.S. Senator has now summarily walked away from productive negotiations. That is unacceptable, and we cannot act like this moment is the end. Children, families, and the future of our planet are counting on us," Ms. Spanberger said.
Democrats had already changed their timeline for the legislation, which they initially hoped to pass by the end of the year, in part because of Mr. Manchin's objections to it. That delay has jeopardized the continuation of monthly cash payments of an expanded child tax credit that Democrats put in place earlier this year.
Republicans cheered Mr. Manchin's statements. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has spoken with Mr. Manchin about the bill's cost and requested a budget analysis of its provisions if lawmakers make them permanent.
Mr. Manchin "has always stated that he will not support a bill full of gimmicks, a bill that added to the debt or a bill that made inflation worse," Mr. Graham said in a written statement.

Full text: Top U.S. financial regulators said they are prepared to take action to address risks to the financial system posed by stablecoins, but first are pushing Congress to enact comprehensive legislation providing oversight of the form of digital currency.
The rapid growth of digital assets, including stablecoins -- digital currencies pegged to national currencies like the U.S. dollar -- is "an important potential emerging vulnerability," regulators on the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, said in their annual report released Friday. The report noted highly volatile prices and the potential for fraud as possible risks in the space.
"If stablecoins are marketed with the claim that they will maintain a stable value, they may be subject to widespread redemptions and asset liquidations if investors doubt the credibility of that claim," the report said.
Highlighting stablecoins in the report is the latest sign that more stringent risk-management standards could lie ahead for companies that issue the digital asset. The annual report is a wide-ranging assessment of risk in the financial system from a panel of regulators established following the 2007-09 recession. Friday's report was the first released during the Biden administration and under Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who leads the council.
While the report said addressing potential financial-system risks related to climate change, nonbank financial institutions -- such as money-market funds and open-end mutual funds -- and Treasury market disruptions are the group's top priorities, it outlined several potential risks from digital assets and stablecoins in particular.
A Treasury official said the council is hoping Congress will pass legislation providing an oversight framework for stablecoins, but that the regulators would be prepared to consider steps available to them in the future if lawmakers don't act. The regulators haven't set a timeline for when they might take their own steps absent congressional action, the official said.
Stablecoins are issued by companies such as Tether Operations Ltd. and Circle Internet Financial Ltd. and are designed to combine the ability to trade quickly online like bitcoin with the stability of national currencies like the dollar. The council's report noted that digital assets may "be subject to the risk of operational failures, fraud, and market manipulation" and that prices are sometimes highly volatile because of speculative activity.
Tether and Circle didn't respond to a request to comment.
The council's signal that it is willing to take a more active role in providing oversight of stablecoins follows a November report on the digital asset from a Treasury-led panel. That report recommended that Congress impose a new regulatory framework around stablecoins. It also urged the FSOC to consider steps to address potential risks from stablecoins, including possibly designating activities associated with the digital asset as or likely to become systemically important.
Climate change is also high on the regulators' agenda. During their meeting Friday, the panel also approved a resolution to establish a new committee that will coordinate climate-related efforts across the regulatory agencies.
The regulators said they are also continuing to assess potential risks posed by nonbank financial institutions and periods of Treasury market disruptions.

Full text: Riots at the Capitol. Searing debates over school closures and vaccine mandates. An attempted recall of California's governor. Paralyzing fights within the Democratic Party. One prominent Republican censured in the House, and another indicted on a charge of defying Congress.
In short, predictions that 2021 would bring a return to "normal" in the world of politics proved badly misplaced.
Instead, nearly all the forces that roiled politics during the general-election year of 2020 carried on when the calendar turned to a new year. The Covid-19 crisis didn't fade into the rearview mirror, nor did former President Donald Trump and his false claims of election fraud. A promised rise of unity and bipartisanship failed to materialize -- and the leader who bore the brunt of the resulting pain was President Biden.
Above all, the story of the year's politics has been one of partisan, cultural and ideological divisions that defy easy resolution. Neither party has the strength to really impose its will, while growing ideological polarization has hollowed out the political center where compromises might be found.
So, in 2021, governing was just hard.
That doesn't mean nothing got done. Congress did pass in March a giant, $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief and stimulus package, which provided a gusher of federal funds that helped lift a listing economy out of the ditch.
But, setting the tone for the year, that measure passed along party lines, with Republicans who complained about its cost and reach refusing to join Democrats in support.
The stage was set for that outcome, and for much of what followed, in the early days of the New Year, when Democrats narrowly won two Georgia runoff elections to fill seats in the Senate. Those wins gave Democrats 50 seats in the Senate, and thereby the thinnest possible margin of control there, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to cast tiebreaking votes.
Democrats were thrilled by the outcome -- though, in retrospect, winning those Senate seats could be viewed as a curse as much as a blessing for the party. Yes, Democrats had secured control of both houses of Congress, but that created among many Democrats, particularly in the party's progressive wing, inflated expectations of what could be accomplished. Demands from the left rose -- and, as it turned out, rose out of proportion to what a razor-thin majority could deliver.
The narrow margin gave effective veto power to a small group of Democratic moderates, particularly Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who simply didn't agree with the scope and sweep of the plans their more progressive colleagues were pushing. Meantime, Republicans, having been pushed entirely into the minority, didn't have to bear responsibility for either what transpired or what didn't get done.
That alignment of forces led to ugly arguments among Democrats about how much money to spend on a giant package of expanded social programs and plans to combat climate change, which the Biden administration calls the Build Back Better package. It was steadily scaled back on a prolonged path to passage in the House, and is now in the hands of the Senate, where winning the final necessary vote from Sen. Manchin has proved vexing to fellow Democrats in both Congress and the White House.
Even the one genuine bipartisan achievement of the year -- a $1 trillion package of infrastructure improvements favored by members of both parties -- fell hostage to Democratic squabbling when progressives held up final passage as a way to get assurances their social-spending and climate priorities would be addressed.
The messiness has proved damaging to Mr. Biden, who had run for president as an experienced Washington hand who knew how to get things done, and who had a record of finding common ground with Republicans.
Two other forces also helped make Mr. Biden's first year in office a difficult one.
First, after several months of promising trend lines, it turned out the coronavirus hadn't faded away after all. The Delta variant surged in spring and summer, which not only slowed down the economic recovery but also brought roaring back ideological, partisan and even geographical divides over how aggressive the government should be in setting rules for virus fighting. The recent emergence of the Omicron variant has added further uncertainty and exasperation.
As if to underscore the unpredictability of the virus as a political force, unhappiness with California Gov. Gavin Newsom's handling of the pandemic fed an effort by opponents to remove him from office, though he prevailed easily when the recall measure came to a vote. Meantime, on the opposite coast, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo went from early coronavirus-fighting hero to disgraced former governor when a scandal over sexual harassment forced him out.
Beyond the virus, the other midyear problem that damaged Mr. Biden was an ugly, sometimes deadly withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan, which commenced after the president embraced a Trump administration decision to pull out all troops.
By late in the year, those headaches, plus a rise of inflation exacerbated by pandemic supply-chain problems, had driven down Mr. Biden's job-approval ratings. They also seemed to contribute to the Democrats' surprising loss in a race for governor of Virginia.
Republicans had their own embarrassing problems to contemplate, as a congressional panel investigating the roots of the Jan. 6 Capitol riots by Trump supporters indicted former Trump adviser Steve Bannon for refusing to cooperate, and the House censured Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar for a video cartoon distributed by his office that showed him killing liberal Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Democrats are left to hope that belated legislative success on their big social-spending and climate package will translate into a political rebound -- and that perhaps Mr. Biden got his most difficult problems out of the way early in his term.
Republicans, meantime, look forward with anticipation to 2022's midterm elections.

Full text: Facing pressure from congressional Democrats and a need to deliver on President Biden's campaign promises, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is instructing financial regulators under her watch to take steps to reduce risks tied to climate change.
Those regulators traditionally have worked to ensure that banks remained sound, markets stayed competitive and investors received fair and accurate information. Now, Ms. Yellen is leaning on agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission to respond to what she says is the urgent threat posed by climate change to the economy and financial assets, such as a portfolio of mortgages in low-lying coastal areas or an insurance company's backing of drought-sensitive farm land.
She is walking a tightrope. Many Republicans and industry advocates say financial regulators shouldn't have their hands deep in environmental policy. Progressive Democrats want bold action quickly. Ms. Yellen has aimed to put climate issues at the top of regulators' agenda, while personally pushing for related legislation and lobbying the private sector.
"We're not an environmental agency," Ms. Yellen said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on the Treasury Department's role on climate issues. "But we can play and are trying to play a very significant role in contributing to our country and the globe in addressing this."
Now the agencies Ms. Yellen convenes as chairwoman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC -- a coalition of regulators established following the 2007-09 recession -- are taking their first steps.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury, plans soon to issue a framework of its expectations for how large banks should be managing climate risk, with detailed guidance to follow next year. The Fed is working on so-called scenario analysis to model financial risks associated with climate change. The SEC plans to issue a rule proposal early next year to strengthen mandatory disclosures around climate-related risks and has sent letters to dozens of publicly traded companies asking them to provide more information to investors about how climate change might affect earnings.
As an overall approach to the issue, the FSOC released a report in October in which the group formally designated climate change an emerging and growing risk to U.S. financial stability, opening up the possibility of more regulatory action.
The actions signal the financial industry can expect a heavier compliance burden and more oversight from Washington tied to the administration's environmental concerns. But the regulatory push is coming under scrutiny from the finance industry and different political corners.
"I acknowledge that global warming is real. However, it does not follow from this that there is a new systemic risk to the financial system," Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, said during an October congressional hearing. "We have had severe weather events since the dawn of time."
Fossil-fuel companies remain among the world's most valuable and widely traded companies, and Mr. Toomey said he thought financial regulators were seeking ultimately to starve them of capital.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration is under pressure from progressives to do more to deliver on Mr. Biden's promises ahead of next year's midterm elections. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden said the U.S. should be an international leader on climate policy, set goals to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, encourage investment in renewable energy and efficiency and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.
Pressure on regulators to act has risen because other aspects of the White House's climate agenda remain mired in the president's $2 trillion social-spending package, which hasn't passed Congress, and some have been stripped out of that bill entirely.
Progressive-leaning lawmakers balked at Mr. Biden's renomination of Jerome Powell for Federal Reserve chairman on the grounds that the institution isn't doing enough to address climate-related risks.

Full text: The deadly tornadoes that ripped through six states in as many hours on Friday night were spawned by unusually hot, humid weather at a time of year when twisters are rare, federal weather scientists said.
It may be several days before the tornadoes in the cluster can be assigned official severity ratings, as authorities cross-check radar records, local weather data and witness reports. But preliminary evidence suggests that the twisters -- which killed scores of people and caused catastrophic damage across a swath of the nation's midsection -- hurled debris as high as 30,000 feet. That is cruising altitude for many passenger jets.
One tornado in the cluster plowed a path of devastation up to 250 miles long, according to initial reports. If those are confirmed, scientists said, it may break a record for the longest tornado track that was set in 1925, when a single tornado traveled 219 miles across portions of Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.
In all, the National Weather Service on Friday received reports of 37 tornadoes across Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi and Tennessee. They arose from a single severe thunderstorm system forged in the vise of a high-pressure system from the east and a colder low-pressure front from the west on a day when temperatures in central and southern states reached near-record highs.
The colliding fronts drew a plume of warm, moist air from the south and pushed it into the upper atmosphere. As the plume rose, meteorologists said, the water vapor it held chilled and condensed into water. That released the energy needed to fuel a titanic explosion of whirlwinds.
"The most extreme aspect of it was the warm temperatures, which had the effect of allowing the air to hold more moisture," Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla., said of the tornado cluster. "If it had been colder, we probably would have gotten it raining or snowing gently."
Federal weather scientists were reluctant to blame climate change for the unseasonable heat that supercharged the storm system. "It's plausible, but we don't have all the links in the chain to make the connection," said Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the NOAA Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla.
In a major report on global warming issued this year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that rising temperatures resulting from greenhouse-gas emissions would trigger extreme weather events, such as more powerful hurricanes and intense rainfall. But in the absence of reliable data, the panel declined to attribute any changes in the frequency or severity of tornadoes to global warming.
As typically happens, powerful winds at ground level and high in the atmosphere lit the fuse for the tornadoes, the scientists said, with the former blowing in one direction and the latter in the other. That tilts horizontal winds into a vertical funnel. A kink in the jet stream -- narrow bands of strong wind in the upper atmosphere at high latitudes -- may also have added a kick to these wind storms.
But no one knows exactly which specific additional factors are needed to generate a powerful tornado.

Full text: A deluge of climate data from a world in flux has scientists scrambling to find ways to store, analyze and preserve vast and unprecedented amounts of information about the effects of rising global temperatures.
Earth's future may depend in part on whether their efforts measure up.
For decades, scientists working to predict changes in the climate relied mostly on calculations involving simple laws of physics and chemistry but little data from the real world. But with temperatures world-wide continuing to rise -- and with data-collection techniques and technologies continuing to advance -- scientists now rely on meticulous measurements of temperatures, ocean currents, soil moisture, air quality, cloud cover and hundreds of other phenomena on Earth and in its atmosphere.
Reliable, readily available data is of critical importance to governments working to set policy and monitor compliance with international climate pacts, as well as to local authorities trying to help their communities adapt to unusual weather patterns or rising seas.
"Now we can truly do climate studies because now we have observations to precisely say how weather trends have changed and are changing," says Suresh Vannan, who manages the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's physical oceanography archive center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California -- one of a dozen earth sciences data centers maintained by the space agency.
"When you are trying to develop long-term environmental records, including climate records, consistent measurement is incredibly valuable," says Kevin Murphy, who as NASA's chief science data officer oversees an archive of Earth observation data used by 3.9 million people last year. "It's irreplaceable data."
And with ever-rising numbers of sensor-studded satellites, aircraft, ocean buoys and the like, there's more data all the time. Over the next decade, officials managing the main U.S. repositories of climate-related information expect their archives' total volume to grow from about 83 petabytes today to more than 650 petabytes. One petabyte of digital memory can hold thousands of feature-length movies, with 650 enough to hold the contents of the Library of Congress 30 times over.
All that information, though, is more than conventional data storage can handle and more than any human mind can readily assimilate, data scientists say. To accommodate it all, the federal workers tasked with managing the data are moving it into the cloud, which offers almost unlimited memory storage while eliminating the need for scientists to maintain their own on-site archives. In addition, these archive managers are devising new analytical techniques and adapting a standard format for the data no matter who collected it and who wants to study it.
They are reinventing climate science from the ground up.
"We are in the midst of a technology evolution," says Nancy Ritchie, archive branch chief at the National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, N.C., which maintains a trove of data about the weather, land, atmosphere and oceans for the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA).
Satellites are key to the story. As of last September, government agencies and private companies had about 900 Earth-orbiting satellites gathering data about our planet, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. That is almost three times as many as were aloft in 2008. More are being readied for launch.
"This is a new era for Earth observation missions, and the huge amount of data they will generate requires a new era of data handling," Dr. Murphy says. "We are about to launch a series of really high data rate missions."
NASA's $1 billion Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission will measure Earth's lakes, rivers and oceans in the first detailed global survey of the planet's surface water. The SUV-size satellite, which is slated to launch in November, is expected to transmit about a terabyte of data every day.
That is a drop in the data bucket compared with the space agency's $1.5 billion Nisar radar imaging satellite, which is scheduled for launch in January 2023. Its sensors will detect movements of the planet's land, ice sheets and sea ice as small as 0.4 inches, transmitting 80 terabytes of data every day.
With current data handling systems and typical internet connections, it would take about a year to download just four days' worth of Nisar data, says Dr. Murphy.
To speed access to the data and lower the cost of computer equipment, NASA and NOAA are working with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Corp. to move their climate databases into the cloud. NOAA expects to upload its entire Earth science archive into the cloud by 2027, Ms. Ritchie says.
For some scientists, the influx of so much information offers an opportunity to weed out uncertainties in the 100 or so computer climate models used to project climate change. Earlier this year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the first time used data on past climate behavior to gauge the reliability of climate models for policy makers.
Data managers are also reorganizing digital climate information to make it easier for machine learning and artificial intelligence systems to access it autonomously. Scientists say AI tools may be able to detect subtle patterns in the data, such as hurricane intensity or ocean eddies, that elude detection by humans.
"Humans can only view and understand things in a very constructed and organized fashion," Ms. Ritchie says. "We like easily readable file names or directory structures because that is the way our brain likes to organize things. When we move to bots, they don't care about directory structures."
Columbia University recently opened a $25 million center to harness AI for climate modeling. And the Climate Modeling Alliance, a consortium of 70 climate scientists, engineers and mathematicians, is working on an experimental AI climate model with $25 million mainly from the National Science Foundation and Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, and his wife, Wendy Schmidt.
"Situations of overwhelming complexity and absurd amounts of data are a sweet spot for AI," says Michael Pritchard, principal investigator at the computational clouds and climate laboratory at the University of California, Irvine. "We are drowning in data and it is not always clear how to use it."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed reducing the amount of ethanol and other biofuels that must be blended into gasoline this year and retroactively lowered last year's mandate, in a win for refiners who warned that raising the requirement would lift prices at the pump.
The decision comes as the price of ethanol, the most-dominant biofuel, has risen to its highest level in a decade. While U.S. gas prices are driven by the price of crude oil, refiners say ethanol prices have contributed to higher prices at the pump, though gasoline has dipped from recent highs.
The EPA said it would require refiners to add 18.52 billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels to be blended into gasoline for 2021 -- down from a mandate of 20.09 billion gallons previously set for 2020. Although 2021 is almost over, no mandate for the current year had yet been set.
Agency officials also lowered the amount required for 2020 to 17.13 billion gallons, down from the 20.09 billion-gallon target it had set in late 2019, the last time the blend rate was set.
Had the EPA kept the 2020 mandate at the previous level, refiners would have had to purchase credits from the market to comply with the law. Federal law allows them to add biofuel or buy credits. Some refiners who had held off on doing either for 2020 had lobbied for that relief after the pandemic depressed energy demand.
The decision was criticized by Emily Skor, chief executive of Growth Energy, a lobbying group for ethanol producers, who called the retroactive cuts "a giveaway to petroleum companies at the expense of rural families and future investment in low-carbon energy."
"The Biden administration simply cannot meet its climate goals while retroactively rolling back low-carbon biofuel blending requirements to help oil refiners," Ms. Skor said.
Biofuel supporters also said that a stronger mandate fit in with President Biden's climate goals. Scientists say ethanol burns more cleanly than traditional gasoline, reducing emissions that warm the planet.
At the same time, however, the EPA raised the proposed biofuel mandate for 2022 to 20.77 billion gallons, which it said would be the highest requirement ever.
The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents oil refineries, said the 2022 mandate would raise gas and diesel prices for U.S. drivers. "This proposal will make things worse for refiners and consumers alike," said the trade group's president, Chet Thompson.
The action comes amid high gas prices that have contributed to inflation and clouded Mr. Biden's political agenda, including his plans to address climate change.
In recent weeks, Mr. Biden has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the oil-and-gas industry was engaging in illegal conduct to keep prices high and agreed to tap the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ease demand.
While he was campaigning for president, Mr. Biden said a strong biofuel mandate would help struggling rural economies where people find work at the country's roughly 200 biorefineries. Top producers include Poet LLC, ADM and Valero Energy Corp.
Sen. Joni Ernst, (R., Iowa), called Tuesday's decision "an about-face by President Joe Biden."
"Iowa is the number one producer of ethanol in the country, and 85% of Iowans believe biofuel plays an integral part in our economy," she said.
The EPA sets blend rates under the so-called Renewable Fuel Standard, which was passed by Congress in 2005. It is supported by lawmakers in states that grow corn, the main ingredient in ethanol, but opposed by some oil refiners who balk at the cost of compliance. Almost all U.S. gasoline contains 10% ethanol.
The proposal isn't final, and regulators said they would review public input before implementing it.

Full text: For funds focused on ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles, the "E" remains king as a magnet for investors.
From January through October, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds specializing in environmental themes attracted far more cash than those ESG funds that focus on other sustainability areas, fund-flow data from Morningstar show. (Fund companies' full data through November isn't yet disclosed.)
The attraction to green funds has been fueled, in part, by growing attention to climate change, an issue that gained further exposure with the COP26 global summit on climate change in Glasgow in November.
"Global media puts a lot of attention on environmental issues, and investment flows mirror that," says James Penny, chief investment officer at TAM Asset Management in London. "In COP26, every headline from here to Australia was dominated by what we are doing about climate change."
Funds with the attributes "low carbon/fossil-fuel-free," and "environmental" had inflows of $28.33 billion and $13.53 billion, respectively, from January through October, according to Morningstar. (Funds may have multiple attributes in Morningstar's analysis, so some flows of individualfunds show up more than once.)
Those strong environment-theme flows contrast with the more modest popularity of funds with the attributes "community development," "other impact themes" and "gender and diversity," which attracted $7.53 billion, $5.99 billion and $5.12 billion, respectively, for the 10 months.
"At times, the singular focus on the environment comes at the expense of social and governance factors," says Jake Walko, director of ESG investing and global investment stewardship at Thornburg Investment Management. Environment-focused funds outdraw other ESG funds part.y because the green-theme funds can use quantifiable metrics to guide their investments and demonstrate their focus more than funds focused on social issues or governance, which might use more-subjective measures, he says.
Also, the relative lack of interest in funds focused on social issues has led to a smaller range of investment products in that sector. The three Morningstar categories of gender, other impact and community development each had far fewer than 100 available funds at the end of October, compared with 165 funds with a low carbon/fossil-fuel-free attribute.
Still, that might be a temporary shortage, at least in some sectors, as Wall Street responds to shifting interests among investors."Gender diversity is gaining traction as an investment theme, and we are seeing more products come to market" focused on that issue, says Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA. In the first 10 months of the year, the number of gender-and-diversity funds grew about 9% to 50 from 46, the Morningstar data show.
Funds focused on corporate governance, meanwhile, may be less popular than other ESG funds in part because governance issues aren't as easy for many investors to understand as other ESG themes. "Governance is not an investible theme in the same way as the other areas," says Hortense Bioy, global director of sustainability research at Morningstar.
Matters of governance include how well a company is managed, the diversity and independence of the board, and the amount and manner of executive compensation. Superior governance is often an attractive feature for many stock pickers. However, it's still not easyto invest using governance as a sole attribute, Ms. Bioy says.
For comparison, natural-resource funds were included in Morningstar's fund-flow analysis. These funds typically hold shares in fossil-fuel and mining companies. Most investors would say that is the opposite of green investing. This year through October, such funds attracted $12.80 billion of inflows.
Soaring commodities prices are part of the reason such funds remain attractive. Crude oil and copper, for instance, have staged strong rallies last year and this year as the global economy emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns.
Also, the world still relies on the extraction of minerals to provide the materials necessary to make clean energy happen. Solar power and electric vehicles both require vast quantities of minerals to be mined, says Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. "While all this ESG investing moves us in the right direction of trying to slow down global warming," he says, "there will be a transition and that will take a while."

Full text: Investing based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors shows no signs of slowing down.
Global sustainable fund assets almost doubled in the past six months to $3.9 trillion at the end of September, according to Morningstar.
So with all the buzz, we wondered what the sector will look like in five years. Here are 10 views on where ESG investing is -- or should be -- heading.
It will grow (but four big ifs)
ESG investment will likely grow in the U.S. only if several big obstacles can be overcome:
First, today there is no coherent and unique definition of what ESG involves, making it impossible for investment professionals as well as everyday investors to identify whether these approaches are actually being carried out.
Second, without agreement on what ESG involves, it's virtually impossible to show that it helps (or hurts) invest performance.
Third, research has shown that ESG ratings developed by corporate ratings firms are rarely correlated with each other or with firm performance.
Fourth, most money managers would agree that there is no free lunch when investors seek to integrate environmental impact, sustainability and governance into the investment process. One study concluded that average expense ratios for ESG funds were almost six times higher than traditional index funds.
Will markets, policy makers and investors resolve these challenges within five years? I'm skeptical, in view of recent reports indicating that so-called green investments are often not green at all, and that many investors are quite financially illiterate. A better system would delink the environmental, the sustainable and the governance criteria, require disclosure of firms' policies along each dimension, and require them to lay out their efforts to change.
-- Olivia S. Mitchell, professor of insurance/risk management and business economics/policy at the Wharton School, and director of the Pension Research Council
Pick your own ESG
A major limitation of ESG funds is that it is hard to find a fund that perfectly aligns with one's own values. Even two individuals who agree on the broader focus of a fund -- say, protecting the environment -- may still disagree on the best way to implement that.
With screening layered on top of direct indexing, investors will have much greater control of how they build an environmentally focused portfolio that reflects their own unique values and preferences. Rather than a blanket environmentalfocus, investors could build a portfolio that aligns with their own precise views on a range of environmental issues.
-- Derek Tharp, assistant professor of finance at the University of Southern Maine and the founder of Conscious Capital
No future
Where will ESG investing be in five years? Dead, I hope.
In my view, ESG funds are a marketing ploy by financial-services firms to repackage actively managed investments -- which were becoming increasingly less appealing -- in a trendy wrapper. They are expensive and accomplish nothing. And they divert people's attention from the hard work that needs to be done.
-- Alicia H. Munnell, director of Boston College's Center for Retirement Research, and the Peter F. Drucker professor of management sciences at BC's Carroll School of Management
More transparent
Within the next five years, greater standardization and accountability in how companies measure and disclose their ESG initiatives will bring much needed transparency to this investment sector. Increasingly, companies will be able to quantify their ESG initiatives as investments that enhance shareholder value -- just as they do now for R&D and capital expenditures.
-- Aaron Yoon, professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University
Beyond recycling
I see ESG investing todayas akin to the recycling movement. Hard to argue against, yet execution varying widely across communities and countries. Like recycling, ESG sounds like a clearly defined goal. Alas, both initiatives involve a range of inputs and outputs to be discussed, decided upon and consistently implemented to create meaningful change.
ESG investing can be a power tool in the drive to improve the climate, diversity and inclusion, and the very purpose of business. Yet this cannot happen until the cultural discourse about its benefits of ESG becomes too loud to ignore. . .just like recycling.
-- Manisha Thakor, founder of financial well-being consulting firm MoneyZen
Core to investing
In five years, 100% of investments will consider ESG risks and opportunities. Whether it is the potential toll of severe weather from climate change or the political and economic instability from inequality, ESG will become fundamental to markets.
I expect that ESG, as an investment practice, will orient around two basic themes. First, there will be a consolidation around a core set of metrics that ar considered, based on consensus rather than weight of data, to be financially material. Standards and regulators will settle in around this core set of metrics to drive consistency and comparability of disclosure in both the equity and fixed-income markets.
Second, a vast world of unstandardized ESG data will emerge that is not priced by markets. From geospatial data tracking climate risk to social-media data projecting cultures of innovation and strong human capital within companies, unstructured ESG data will be incredibly valuable.
-- Todd Cort , lecturer in sustainability at the Yale School of Management and faculty co-directorat Yale Center for Business and the Environment
In more 401(k)s
While I think ESG is definitely poised for growth in both interest and usage in the next five years, one area that I see more-cautious growth is in the defined contribution/401(k) space. This area should be considered especially important since it's where most Americans accumulate the bulk of their savings, and an increasing number of plan participants have said they are interested in aligning their portfolios with their ESG beliefs.
-- David Blanchett, retirement-research head, PGIM DC Solutions
Nothing 'extra'
I expect that ESG as a term won't exist as a separate, siloed concept; it will be fully incorporated into the investing process. ESG will just be the way that asset managers and others do their work, ESG won't be something "extra" or "special" in financial decision-making. This is, in part, because over the past few years, financial markets (and the world for that matter) have experienced firsthand how ESG risks such as human rights and labor issues, climate change and corruption are directly linkedâ€¯to compliance risks, reputational risks, and bottom-lineâ€¯financial performance.
-- Alexandra Mihailescu Cichon, executive vice president, ESG data-science firm RepRisk
Separate account
The place with the most interesting potential is customized ESG exposure via separately managed accounts (SMAs).
Rather than owning a diversified basket of securities via pooled assets such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, holding individual securities directly through a SMA offers the opportunity to personalize portfolios according to the ESG issues that matter most to an individual.
This structure not only more closely aligns a portfolio with the investor's values, it also allows the investor a greater opportunity for personal impact on ESG issues through voting in shareholder resolutions -- an opportunity otherwise held by asset manager when getting ESG exposure through a mutual fund or ETF.
-- Peter Lazaroff, chief investment officer at Plancorp
A new landscape
Over the next five years, the "E" (environmental) and "S" (social) will drive changes in "G" (corporate governance). The changes embedded in ESG are secular and are likely to permanently change the corporate landscape. ESG will drive fundamental changes in business organizational structure and its impact on shareholder returns will only grow.
-- Stephen H. Dover, chief market strategist, head of Franklin Templeton Investment Institute

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Congress is racing against the clock to complete a series of must-pass pieces of legislation, with Democrats pushing to finish their roughly $2 trillion social and climate policy legislation by the end of the year.
The scramble is coming as President Biden confronts low polling numbers and high inflation, and as Democrats are increasingly worried about their ability to retain the majority in the House in the midterms next year. Lawmakers are under pressure to pass the bills ahead of contentious campaigning that will start in earnest in coming months.
Congress is expected to focus this week on the defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which was held up in the Senate last week over provisions regarding Russia and China. Instead of the Senate passing its own bill, a compromise bill negotiated by leadership in the House and Senate is expected to come to the House for a vote as early as this week.
The defense bill sets priorities and policy for the fiscal year, which began in October. The bill's failure to pass would prevent service members from receiving hazard pay, delay military construction projects in the U.S. and around the world, and remove authorization from the military to support allies in the fight against terrorism, according to a GOP aide on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Lawmakers must also raise the debt limit by around midmonth, when the Treasury has said its emergency measures to pay government obligations will run out. Congress has never before failed to increase the debt limit. The limit sets the maximum amount the U.S. is allowed to borrow to pay its debts, but partisan acrimony has complicated efforts to forge an agreement ahead of the deadline.
Lawmakers are discussing the possibility of addressing the debt limit as part of the NDAA, according to people familiar with the talks. Democrats will need Republican support in the House to pass the defense bill because members of their far-left flank often object to expanding military spending. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) has said he opposed attaching the debt-ceiling provision, calling it a gimmick.
If Congress doesn't lift the ceiling, the U.S. could default on its debt, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned could trigger an increase in interest rates, a drop in stock prices, and broader financial turmoil, possibly a recession. Government programs, such as Social Security, could be affected.
The long to-do list of legislation is delaying Democrats' efforts to finish their roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package, dubbed Build Back Better, by the end of the year. The bill passed the House last month and the Senate is negotiating a bill that could pass with all 50 senators in the Democratic caucus supporting it.
The House-passed bill is expected to be altered to fit the procedural tactic that Senate Democrats are using to pass the legislation with just a simple majority, known as reconciliation. Senators will debate with the parliamentarian on what provisions can comply, according to aides, putting some immigration- and drug-pricing-related provisions in peril. It isn't clear when that process will be complete.
"The president is optimistic" that Congress will pass the legislation by Christmas, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said on MSNBC on Sunday.
Two pivotal Democratic lawmakers, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, haven't committed to supporting the final text, raising doubts about the party's timeline.
No Republicans are expected to support the legislation, objecting to what they call irresponsible spending that could damage the economy. The bill is expected to spend roughly $555 billion on clean-energy investments and initiatives to combat climate change, extend the enhanced child tax credit for one year, implement a universal prekindergarten and lower healthcare costs for millions of Americans.
The House version of the bill includes four weeks of paid leave, but that provision is expected to be stripped out of the Senate version because of Mr. Manchin's objections.
Separately, some Democratic members of the House are pushing for a resolution to punish Rep. Lauren Boebert (R., Colo.) for a widely condemned remark casting Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), one of two Muslim women in Congress, as a suicide bomber. Democrats are frustrated that Mr. McCarthy hasn't taken action against Ms. Boebert and want to remove the freshman congresswoman from her committee positions.
Ms. Omar said she spoke to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and believes the House will act to rebuke Ms. Boebert. A spokesman for Mrs. Pelosi didn't respond to a question about the matter.
"I've had a conversation with the speaker and I'm very confident that she will take decisive action next week," Ms. Omar said on CNN.
Mr. McCarthy declined to condemn the comments on Friday and said Ms. Boebert had apologized publicly on Twitter, though Ms. Boebert didn't mention Ms. Omar by name in her tweet.
Democrats have removed two Republicans from committee posts this year for inflammatory comments and some lawmakers worry that continuing to police GOP lawmakers for comments will open them up to retaliation should they lose the House next year.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren's opposition to President Biden's renomination of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell marks her most public break with her onetime presidential rival, whose economic policy and personnel choices she has helped shape.
Ms. Warren said Monday that she would vote against Mr. Powell's nomination for a second term as Fed chairman, a move that was widely expected after she assailed Mr. Powell in September as a dangerous man who would weaken banking rules. She announced her support for Fed governor Lael Brainard, who was nominated to serve as Fed vice chairwoman.
But in casting her opposition to Mr. Powell, Ms. Warren is also staking out ground on a critical nomination to come: vice chairman of supervision. The Fed board role "must be filled by a strong regulator with a proven track record of tough and effective enforcement," Ms. Warren said, urging Mr. Biden to act quickly.
Ms. Warren remained in touch with the White House as Mr. Biden considered his options on the Fed. She met privately at the White House with the president on Nov. 9, according to officials familiar with the meeting, outlining her concerns about Mr. Powell on regulations, climate change and ethics. As Mr. Biden was nearing an announcement, she spoke by phone with him last Thursday.
Mr. Biden has three remaining vacancies to fill on the Fed board, which the White House said would be announced in early December. Ms. Warren told Mr. Biden during their conversations that the openings would give him the opportunity to remake the central bank. She urged him to nominate an aggressive regulator for the vice chairman of supervision role, according to a person familiar with the talks.
Mr. Biden, during an event announcing Mr. Powell's and Ms. Brainard's nominations, said filling those vacancies would provide "new diversity to the Fed, which is much needed and long overdue."
Mr. Powell is expected to win significant backing from the Senate Republican caucus, which includes nearly three dozen lawmakers who supported his 2018 nomination by former President Donald Trump.
Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) said he intended to back Mr. Powell but added: "My only concern with Chairman Powell has been his very dovish approach in the face of really obvious long-term inflation. I believe that that approach has been because he is close to renomination and wants to be renominated. I have a hard time believing he doesn't understand it better than he does."
Mr. Powell's renomination has served as a dividing line for Democrats, led by Ms. Warren's contention that the central bank should be run by someone who would push for tougher bank regulations and policies that help address climate change. Lawmakers such as Sens. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) announced opposition.
But other Democrats have backed Mr. Powell as a consensus choice who has sought to build a stronger labor market recovery and modulate monetary policy in the face of rising inflation and supply chain bottlenecks during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Ms. Warren's opposition to Mr. Powell returns her to one of the issues that brought her from relative obscurity as a Harvard Law School professor to the Senate nearly a decade ago. A bankruptcy law expert, Ms. Warren was a vocal critic of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's push to deregulate markets, moves that she said undercut the housing market and helped lead to the financial crisis of 2008.
Ms. Warren has also shown her ability to harness progressives around a nomination fight. In late 2014, she led the opposition to the nomination of Antonio Weiss, a Lazard banker, to serve as undersecretary for domestic finance at Treasury. The Obama administration pulled Mr. Weiss's nomination, but he was later installed as an adviser to then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.
Ms. Warren's opposition is unlikely to galvanize enough Senate Democrats to derail the nomination of Mr. Powell, a Republican. Mr. Powell is expected to win support from several Republicans and easily won confirmation as chairman in 2018.
Ms. Warren has accused Mr. Powell of providing a Republican majority on the seven-member Fed board that risks driving the economy "over a financial cliff again." Ms. Warren had praised Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen when she led the Fed for putting as much emphasis on banking supervision as on monetary policy.
Ms. Warren's view of Mr. Powell isn't universal among progressives. Some laud Mr. Powell for fostering a favorable labor-hiring climate.
Ms. Warren suggested in an interview that Mr. Powell wasn't the only Democratic appointee who would be willing to foster a favorable hiring environment even if it meant rising inflation. "Any Democrat would be good on monetary policy," she said.

Senator's Influence
Can Be Widely Seen
The renomination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell over Sen. Elizabeth Warren's objections serves as a rare loss for the senator at the start of the Biden administration.
Several people hired by Ms. Warren now work in the administration, including Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra, National Economic Council deputy director Bharat Ramamurti and Wally Adeyemo, deputy Treasury secretary.
Ms. Warren helped author the 15% minimum tax that is a key revenue source in President Biden's social-welfare and climate-policy bill. Ms. Warren's child-care proposals are also reflected in the plan. And lawmakers briefly considered a tax on realized gains for billionaires, a plan that brought comparisons to her 2% wealth tax from her presidential campaign.

Full text: President Biden said he would nominate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term leading the central bank, opting for continuity in U.S. economic policy despite pushback from some fellow Democrats who wanted someone tougher on bank regulations and climate change.
Mr. Biden said he also would nominate Fed governor Lael Brainard as vice chairwoman of the central bank's board of governors. Progressive groups had mounted a last-ditch campaign to pressure the president to tap Ms. Brainard, a Democrat, for the top job, and prominent liberals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) had warned the president against reupping Mr. Powell, who is a Republican and who was nominated to the post by Mr. Biden's GOP predecessor, Donald Trump.
The announcement caps months of behind-the-scenes deliberations by Mr. Biden and his senior aides over one of the world's most important economic-policy posts at a time of high inflation and intraparty divisions.
The president's decision reflected his desire to maintain stability at the central bank amid public concerns about high prices for everything from groceries to fuel, administration officials said. Mr. Biden's advisers said they want to focus much of their attention on passage of their social spending and climate legislation and believe Mr. Powell would more easily win Senate confirmation, despite objections from progressives.
"Put directly: At this moment both of enormous potential and enormous uncertainty for our economy, we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve. Jay has proven the independence that I value in a Fed chair," Mr. Biden said at the White House on Monday, where he appeared with Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard.
Stocks rose modestly after the announcement and ended the day little changed. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced less than 0.1%.
Several lawmakers of both parties expressed support for Mr. Powell on Monday, including Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat and Republican, respectively, on the Senate Banking Committee.
In recent weeks, Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard emerged as Mr. Biden's only two candidates to lead the Fed. They met with Mr. Biden separately at the White House on Nov. 4, and the president spoke with them about his decision on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Powell was backed for the job by several members of Mr. Biden's economic team, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who served as chairwoman of the Fed for a four-year term before Mr. Powell.
The president, in his remarks Monday, said Mr. Powell told him that he would make accelerating the Fed's efforts to address the risks that climate change pose to the U.S. financial system a priority. Mr. Biden also said the Fed chairman would underscore "making sure that our financial regulations are staying ahead of emerging risks, be they from innovations and cryptocurrency or the practices of less regulated nonbank financial institutions."
Mr. Powell said he would work to address inflation.
"We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market, and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched," he said at the White House event.
Ms. Brainard, in brief remarks, said, "I'm committed to putting working Americans at the center of my work at the Federal Reserve. This means getting inflation down at a time when people are focused on their jobs and how far their paychecks will go."
Mr. Biden can put his stamp on the central bank with three additional appointments. There is already one vacancy on the Fed's seven-member board of governors, and Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida's term as governor will expire in January. The four-year term of the vice chair of bank supervision, previously held by current Fed governor Randal Quarles, expired in October and he plans to retire around the end of the year. Mr. Biden plans to announce those nominations in early December, the White House said Monday.
Because some progressives were disappointed by Mr. Powell's nomination, the White House faces greater pressure over who it chooses to fill those vacancies. Progressives are especially focused on ensuring that the next vice chair of bank supervision is committed to tougher regulation and addressing climate change.
Ms. Warren reiterated her opposition to Mr. Powell's nomination and said she would support Ms. Brainard's nomination for vice chairwoman.
Mr. Powell faces an especially delicate economic challenge as the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and the government's response have sharply boosted demand and disrupted global supply chains, sending inflation to its highest levels in more than a decade.
He will have to lead his colleagues through a debate over how soon to raise rates. The danger for the Fed is twofold: Officials don't want to overreact by raising interest rates and cooling down the economy if supply-chain bottlenecks repair themselves. But they also don't want to underreact as wages rise, fueling a more traditional inflationary cycle.
Mr. Biden's announcement removes a key source of uncertainty over who might have to manage such a pivot should officials conclude that it is warranted.
Mr. Powell, 68 years old, is seen by supporters inside the administration and in markets as a steady hand whose extensive, personal outreach helped restore bipartisan support for the central bank one decade after its reputation was badly bruised by the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Powell, a former private-equity executive, was named to the Fed's seven-member board 10 years ago by then-President Barack Obama and elevated to the chairman's post four years ago by then-President Trump.
The political support Mr. Powell cultivated proved valuable throughout his term as chairman -- first, when he faced steady attacks in 2018 and 2019 from Mr. Trump for raising interest rates, and later, when he led a rapid, aggressive response to douse a global financial panic triggered by the pandemic.
Under Mr. Powell, the Fed orchestrated one of the largest and boldest economic policy responses since World War II, acting in concert with Congress and the U.S. Treasury. The Fed slashed interest rates to zero and then purchased trillions of dollars of government debt and offered to buy trillions more in loans and other assets to backstop credit markets.
Mr. Powell unveiled in 2020 a substantial shift in the way the central bank conducts interest-rate policy when he said the Fed would set aside its practice of raising rates to pre-empt inflationary pressures and instead leave rates lower for longer.
The shift reflected the Fed's reassessment of the economy in 2019, when inflation didn't pick up as policy makers expected it would with the unemployment rate falling to its lowest levels in 50 years. Mr. Powell navigated a policy U-turn from raising rates to cutting them while facing sustained criticism from Mr. Trump, who privately and publicly threatened to sack the Fed leader for not providing easier monetary policy.
At the beginning of this year, Fed officials were anxious to avoid a rerun of what followed the 2007-09 recession, in which weak growth forced the central bank to deploy novel measures to stimulate an economy in which short-term rates were already pinned near zero. But the reopening of the economy and a $1.9 trillion federal spending boost signed by Mr. Biden in March, on top of trillions of dollars of relief spending in 2020, fueled a larger-than-anticipated surge in consumer prices, which rose 4.4% in September from a year earlier, according to the Fed's preferred gauge.
The Fed recently began shrinking its $120 billion-a-month bond-purchase stimulus program by $15 billion every month, a pace that could end the purchases around June. After that, the focus will turn to when and how quickly the central bank should raise interest rates from near zero.
Mr. Powell has to manage a group of 12 reserve bank presidents and as many as six other governors who participate in rate-setting meetings. Several are growing more concerned that high inflation will persist, requiring the central bank to raise rates sooner or more aggressively than expected just a few months ago. Others are nervous about overreacting and have argued that pre-pandemic dynamics in which inflation, interest rates and global growth were historically low will eventually reassert themselves.
Mr. Biden's political fortunes in the coming years might be tied to how Mr. Powell responds. If the Fed waits too long, U.S. consumers could face higher inflation for years, or the central bank could be forced to raise rates aggressively, convulsing financial markets and putting the economy into a downturn. If it moves too fast or too soon, it risks prematurely slowing down hiring.
Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have argued that price pressures reflect bottlenecks from disrupted supply chains, temporary shortages and a rebound in travel. But Mr. Powell has warned in recent weeks that price pressures could also reflect stronger demand and that overwhelmed supply chains could lead to more persistent inflation than officials initially anticipated.
"We have to be in a position to address that risk," he said at a Nov. 3 news conference. "We think we can be patient. If a response is called for, we will not hesitate."
The Fed said last year it would hold rates near zero until it was confident inflation would run moderately above its 2% target and that labor markets were consistent with maximum employment. The unemployment rate has declined considerably this year, falling to 4.6% in October.
Fed officials could raise rates either once they judge the labor market has largely recovered from the pandemic or if they conclude the recent interval of high inflation is expected to last for long enough that households and businesses expect higher prices to continue, driving up wages and inflation as part of a more sustained cycle. The rate-rise process could be especially difficult this time because Mr. Powell over the past year has pledged to promote a more inclusive and broad-based recovery. Raising rates could lead to political blowback that the Fed is pulling back on those commitments.
In recent months, a range of current and former Democratic lawmakers along with progressive economists had spoken out in favor of extending a second term to Mr. Powell. They argued his skill transcending the polarization that has gridlocked much of Washington made him uniquely positioned to provide political support and intellectual backing for progressive policies.
"In this political environment, any other nominee would risk being perceived as a political choice," said Roberto Perli, an analyst at Cornerstone Macro, a research firm in Washington.
Mr. Powell navigated attacks from both Mr. Trump and Ms. Warren in "a high-wire act of political survival," said Marc Sumerlin of economic-consulting Evenflow Macro. If the Fed raises interest rates to slow down the economy next year, "Biden may come to feel the same way as Trump, but the nation will be better served with continuity," he said.
Other Democrats expressed concern that progressives' priorities might further yoke the Fed to broader partisan warfare that the institution has largely avoided. They worried such moves could undermine its effectiveness on a new monetary policy strategy that has placed new emphasis on tighter labor markets.
Elevating Ms. Brainard to vice chairwoman represents a compromise of sorts between the two camps. The vice chair of the board, together with the New York Fed president, traditionally serve as the Fed chair's top lieutenants in designing monetary policy.

Biden Nears Decision on Fed Pick --- Choice expected this week, with Democrats divided over whether Powell deserves nod

Full text: President Biden faces one of the most important economic policy decisions of his presidency, which is expected this week, when deciding who should lead the Federal Reserve when Chairman Jerome Powell's term expires in February.
Mr. Biden has signaled he is looking for continuity in Fed policy because he is considering whether to reappoint Mr. Powell for a second four-year term or elevate governor Lael Brainard, who has strongly backed the central bank's interest rate policy over the past four years.
Instead, the president's choice might turn on politics rather than economics because Mr. Powell's candidacy has divided progressive Democrats and led to competing views inside the Biden administration.
Mr. Biden's senior advisers remain focused on securing Democratic support for their $1.85 trillion healthcare, education and climate-change package, which the House approved last week. The intraparty split over the Fed decision has complicated their political calculus as they seek to narrow Democrats' differences over the spending package, according to people familiar with the matter.
One group of Democratic lawmakers, which includes Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, has called on Mr. Biden, a fellow Democrat, to install a new Fed chair because they want the central bank to take a tougher approach on bank regulation and to use those supervisory powers more aggressively to address climate change. They are also eager to see more diversity at the senior ranks of the U.S. government.
Other Democrats have lauded Mr. Powell's response to the coronavirus pandemic and his focus on elevating the importance of tighter labor markets, which they said greatly benefits minorities and other potential workers that typically struggle to find jobs. These backers have said strong and unique bipartisan congressional support for Mr. Powell has insulated the central bank's policies against more intense partisanship across Washington.
Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) said on Sunday that it would be a mistake for Mr. Biden not to renominate Mr. Powell. "I think he would be confirmed by a large margin if the president appointed him," Mr. Tester said on NBC, arguing that Mr. Powell has a "proven track record."
White House officials said Mr. Biden will make public his decision before Thanksgiving. The announcement is expected before the president leaves for his holiday trip to Nantucket, Mass., on Tuesday. Mr. Biden is scheduled to deliver remarks about the economy that day from the White House.
Mr. Biden's advisers have been divided over the Fed chair pick, with some preferring Ms. Brainard to mollify progressives and ease their discontent as Mr. Biden's spending ambitions are narrowed by moderates' objections.
Others, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, prefer to maintain continuity at the Fed and to avoid further politicizing central-bank policy by keeping Mr. Powell.
The political implications partly explain why Mr. Biden's decision is being made later than his predecessors. Advisers have seen little reason to decide on the Fed chair since the decision could upset lawmakers no matter whom he picks and since Mr. Biden needs all Democrats to support his spending plans amid unified Republican opposition.
Brian Deese, the director of the White House National Economic Council, declined on Sunday to say whether Mr. Biden had made a final decision.
"There are multiple positions open at the Federal Reserve, which the president will have an opportunity to nominate qualified candidates for and is looking at all of those issues," Mr. Deese told Fox News when asked about the push by progressives to make the Fed more assertive on climate change.
In addition to the chair's position, Mr. Biden has one vacancy to fill on the seven-seat Fed board of governors, with two more slots he can fill by January. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, hinted last week that the White House might announce one or two other Fed appointments at the same time as the chair.
Mr. Powell, 68 years old, is a Republican and former private-equity executive who was nominated in 2011 by then-President Barack Obama to join the Fed board and tapped in 2017 by then-President Donald Trump to lead the central bank.
Ms. Brainard, 59, is a Democrat and an economist who joined the Fed in 2014 after working in the Obama Treasury Department and the Clinton White House on international economic issues.
Mr. Biden's political fortunes might be tied to how the next Fed leader responds to a period of high inflation that is lasting longer than anticipated.
Both Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have argued this year that rising prices primarily reflect supply-chain bottlenecks that will abate on their own and shouldn't require the Fed to slow down economic growth to put the brakes on inflation.
Fed officials will have to decide whether or when to raise interest rates to restrain inflation. If they move too little or too late, they risk letting inflation get worse for longer. If they move too much or too soon, they risk causing an economic downturn.
Two Fed officials said last week that the central bank will discuss at its December meeting whether to speed up plans to wind down the central bank's asset-purchase program. The central bank will buy $105 billion in Treasurys and mortgage bonds this month, and $90 billion next month. At the current pace of runoff, the Fed would end purchases by June. Officials want to be done providing stimulus with asset purchases before they consider raising rates.
Beginning in the 1980s, presidents reappointed the sitting Fed leader, often making a political calculation that continuity in the role -- particularly when the leadership was viewed as effective by Washington and Wall Street -- would serve the economy best.
Mr. Trump broke that precedent in 2017, when he tapped Mr. Powell to succeed then-Chairwoman Yellen.
Mr. Biden could continue Mr. Trump's precedent of replacing the Fed leader with a member of his own party by opting for Ms. Brainard. "This would make the Fed chair more like every cabinet position, which is presumed to turn over when the White House changes, which would change the partisan tenor of the institution," said Tom Graff, head of fixed income and portfolio manager at Brown Advisory. "Markets would react to that."
Political strategists said that Mr. Powell likely faces an easier path to Senate confirmation, despite objections from a handful of Democrats who regard him as insufficiently aggressive on climate change or bank regulation and from some Republicans who are opposed to easier monetary policy. That is because Mr. Powell is likely to attract sufficient political support from lawmakers in both parties.

Deforestation Rate
In Amazon Jumps
Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest has reached a 15-year high, newly released data show. The surge is prompting environmentalists and scientists to question the government's willingness to meet the pledge it made at the COP26 climate summit this month to end illegal woodlands destruction by 2028.
About 5,100 square miles of Brazil's Amazon -- bigger than the size of Connecticut -- was denuded in the 12 months between August 2020 and the end of July, a rise of 22% from the previous year and the most deforestation in one year since 2006, said Brazil's space research agency, INPE.
The data release incensed environmentalists. INPE uploaded its findings on deforestation onto a federal government database on Oct. 27 -- four days before the United Nations climate change conference began, an official at the agency said. The government only publicly released the data late Thursday.
Brazil's Environment Ministry denied that it delayed the release of the INPE's data.

MALAYSIA
Ex-Leader Withdraws
Free Home Request
Former Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was convicted of corruption last year for his role in one of the world's largest financial scandals, withdrew his request for a multimillion-dollar property from the Malaysian government after it sparked a clash in parliament a day earlier.
A budget hearing broke into debate on Thursday as opposition lawmakers questioned the country's finance minister over reports about the property, which Mr. Najib said he was entitled to under a remuneration law for members of parliament.
Mr. Najib said Friday that he would give up the request because he didn't want the issue to interfere with Saturday's local elections. He said he didn't know the value of the allocation, which the opposition claims is worth almost $24 million -- $14.3 million for land and about $9.5 million to build a house.
In July 2020, a court sentenced him to 12 years in prison and fined him nearly $50 million in relation to the 1Malaysia Development Bhd. scandal. Mr. Najib, still a member of parliament, denies wrongdoing. He is free on bail as he appeals his conviction.

AFRICA
Blinken Highlights
Policy for Continent
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the U.S. would treat African countries as equals rather than "subjects of geopolitics" in a speech meant to set out the Biden administration's policy toward the continent.
Mr. Blinken told an audience of young Africans and dignitaries at the Economic Community of West African States that the continent was critical to solving many of today's key global challenges, including the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, economic recovery and democratic and human rights.
"Too often, we ask our partners to help uphold and defend an international system that they don't feel fully reflects their needs and aspirations. And we're sensitive to centuries of colonialism, slavery, and exploitation have left painful legacies that endure today," Mr. Blinken said.
While avoiding direct mention of China or Russia, Mr. Blinken's speech sought to differentiate the administration's approach to Africa from that of its rivals, which the U.S. has accused of using investments on the continent to further their political aims.

Full text: Two liberal Democratic senators said Friday they would oppose a second term for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell because they want the central bank to play a more aggressive role addressing climate change.
Sens. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) issued a statement calling on President Biden to appoint a Fed chair "who will ensure the Fed . . . shares the administration's view that fighting climate change is the responsibility of every policy maker. That person is not Jerome Powell."
Mr. Biden is deciding between reappointing Mr. Powell, a Republican, when his four-year term expires in February, or promoting Fed governor Lael Brainard, a Democrat, who has largely supported Mr. Powell's approach on interest-rate policy while advocating a tougher regulatory posture.
Three Senate Democrats have publicly opposed a second term for Mr. Powell. The other is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). None of them have endorsed an alternative candidate. Mr. Powell likely faces a much more comfortable path to gaining 50 Senate votes in any confirmation process because he enjoys support from lawmakers in both parties. Ms. Brainard is more likely to be confirmed on a near party-line vote.
Other Democrats, including Montana Sen. Jon Tester, have opposed calls to replace Mr. Powell because they have said they don't want to take steps that further politicize the operations of the central bank.
Mr. Powell, 68 years old, is a former private-equity executive who was nominated in 2011 by former President Barack Obama to join the Fed board and tapped four years ago by former President Donald Trump to lead the central bank.
Ms. Brainard, 59, is an economist who joined the Fed in 2014 after working in the Obama Treasury Department and the Clinton White House on international economic issues.
Progressive Democrats have grown frustrated this year over the prospects of addressing climate change through the legislative process and have instead turned their focus to regulatory agencies to advance overhauls through the administrative process.
Environmental groups have placed more pressure on the Fed to use its powers overseeing the safety and soundness of the banking system to take steps that range from monitoring banks' resilience to climate-related weather events to more actively influencing borrowing costs for fossil-fuel-related investments.
Other Democrats have said the push for the Fed to unilaterally tackle climate risks is misguided because it could create political opposition and prompt Congress to curb its autonomy more broadly.
"It would be great to have a central bank that actively promoted clean energy . . . but this is not a power that has been given to the Fed by Congress," said Dean Baker, a co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. "While it can arguably do this with the power it has, it would be virtually certain to lose this power very quickly if it went this route."
The Fed this year has built out two committees designed to monitor climate-related risks in the biggest banks and in the financial system as a whole. But Mr. Powell has been sensitive to potential political blowback, given the U.S. political divisions over how or whether to address climate change.
"We do think we have a role in climate change," Mr. Powell said at a press conference this month. "We expect [financial institutions] . . . to understand and be in a position to manage their risks," including physical risks or so-called transition risks, or the costs associated with moving to a lower-carbon economy.
But he pushed back against calls from environmental groups for the Fed to influence the cost of borrowing for certain energy investments. "That's not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency. That's a decision for elected representatives," he said.
Ms. Brainard has detailed ways for the Fed to direct the biggest banks to manage climate-related risks as part of a broader effort to monitor potential hazards to the financial system. "It's an area where the U.S. has been behind, and we need to catch up," Ms. Brainard said in October.
Other Fed officials who have been more vocal about the need to monitor climate risks have nevertheless warned recently against asking too much of the central bank.
"I would encourage all of us not to think the Fed is the magic solution to how we're going to solve climate risk," said San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly last week.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden says he wants to save the planet and save union jobs. The electric-vehicle tax credit in his social-spending package shows how those aims can sometimes conflict.
The proposal being negotiated by House and Senate Democrats gives consumers the full $12,500 tax write-off only if they buy electric vehicles assembled by union workers using U.S.-built batteries. Automobiles produced in nonunion factories would qualify for $4,500 less.
Rep. Dan Kildee and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, Michigan Democrats, wrote the electric-vehicle tax credit after collaborating with the United Auto Workers and General Motors Co. about including an explicitly pro-union component, according to Mr. Kildee.
The labor-friendly provision has touched off a fierce lobbying battle by Tesla Inc., Toyota Motor Corp., and other nonunion auto companies that said Mr. Biden is betraying the environment to help a political ally, the United Auto Workers.
"Biden is a UAW. . .puppet," Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk wrote on Twitter, replying to a tweet about the EV tax credits. Tesla, the world's biggest electric-car maker, didn't respond to a request to comment.
Mr. Biden, a Democrat, visited a GM electric-vehicle assembly plant Wednesday in Detroit and toured the newly renovated factory with GM Chief Executive Mary Barra. He also briefly drove the GMC Hummer electric pickup truck, which is set to go on sale in coming weeks at a base price of around $100,000. "We're going to make sure the jobs of the future end up here in Michigan and not halfway around the world," he said.
The infrastructure bill Mr. Biden signed into law this month includes $7.5 billion to expand the network of electric-vehicle charging stations.
"President Biden's commitment is clear -- jobs taking on the climate crisis must also be jobs that build the middle class," a White House spokesman said.
Environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the climate-policy think tank Energy Innovation, support the pro-union approach, saying they respect that Mr. Biden is trying to balance several missions in the social-spending plan.
That has left it largely to the disadvantaged companies to make the environmental case. Georgia, Tennessee and other states with nonunion auto facilities also have joined the opposition.
"Let's not play politics with the environment," Toyota says in full-page newspaper ads.
Autos Drive America, a trade group representing foreign-based car companies, recently aired television ads saying, "Congress is at it again. They're pushing a sweetheart deal that rewards unions at the expense of the environment and consumer choice."
The UAW said in a statement that it backs Mr. Biden's approach to the electric-vehicle tax credit because it will "create and preserve tens of thousands of UAW members' jobs."
For the UAW, electric vehicles represent a challenge. Because those cars are simpler to build than ones with internal-combustion engines, fewer employees are needed and the jobs that remain could pay less, according to studies produced by the UAW.
The union has told the Biden administration that the country shouldn't sacrifice union jobs to meet its climate goals.
Mr. Biden, who attended the international climate summit in Glasgow, signed an executive order in August that set a target that half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 will be net-zero emissions. Transportation is the biggest U.S. contributor to climate change.
According to Autos Drive America, only two of more than 50 electric vehicles on the market would be eligible for the whole tax credit. Both are Chevy Bolts, made by the UAW-organized General Motors.
Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis NV also have UAW workforces but their current electric models don't qualify for the full credit.
Limiting consumer choice means fewer people will buy electric vehicles, undermining Mr. Biden's goal of cleaner transportation, said Jennifer Safavian, chief executive of Autos Drive America. "If this is really for the environment, this is not the way to do it," she said. "It's a pro-union proposal, and they are admitting that."
Mr. Kildee said the nonunion companies' claims of unfairness are disingenuous -- particularly when they come from foreign auto makers such as Toyota that are unionized in their home countries.
Joe Aldy, who served as special assistant to the president for energy and the environment under President Barack Obama, said the union provision complicates the overall goal of tackling climate change.
"In the climate context, we have an overriding objective to get out all the technology we can that enables our economy to run on zero emissions," Mr. Aldy said. "Then we layer on another objective: We want to create good-paying jobs. Then we say we want them to be union, good-paying jobs.
"As we add on these objectives, sometimes it makes it harder to satisfy all of them, and satisfy all of them quickly," he said.
The language of the proposed electric-vehicle tax credit began taking shape over the summer. In July, GM's Ms. Barra arranged a call with the Michigan delegation and stressed the importance of federal financial support for the auto maker's goal of producing all-electric vehicles by 2035.
"A lot of it was us pushing our hometown priorities," said Mr. Kildee, who was on the call. He said he told Ms. Barra it was important that new EV facilities be located where older car factories are now.

Full text: Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya's Social Capital Holdings Inc. is leading a $20 million funding round for a startup that hopes to use machine learning to address the challenge of producing electric-vehicle battery components outside China.
Mr. Palihapitiya's venture-capital firm is backing Mitra Future Technologies Inc., a Silicon Valley company aiming to more efficiently make the components needed for rechargeable batteries, the companies said. The $20 million investment is the first significant fundraising round, or Series A, for the startup, which goes by Mitra Chem.
The company didn't disclose its valuation. Other investors include Taiwanese billionaire Richard Tsai and climate-focused Earthshot Ventures.
Founded earlier this year, Mitra Chem is focused on producing vital lithium-ion battery parts such as cathodes in North America. The company initially plans to work on producing a cathode -- the side of a battery that absorbs electrons when it is generating power -- that uses more of the metal iron and less of scarce, pricey materials nickel and cobalt.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and others in the industry have touted iron-based batteries as the future because they say they are cheaper and safer.
Mitra Chem joins other startups in aiming to whittle away at China's dominance in the battery industry. The concentration of battery production in China due to the country's low costs and chemical-industry expertise is a concern for U.S. policy makers and executives aiming to accelerate domestic electric-vehicle production.
"This is a massive Achilles' heel for us as a nation," said Mitra Chem CEO Vivas Kumar, a former Tesla senior manager focused on the battery supply chain.
The company plans to acquire the materials needed for iron-based cathode production from metals producers, make components such as cathodes, then supply them to battery-cell producers.
It is also adding Mr. Palihapitiya and supply-chain executive Will Drewery to its board of directors. Mr. Drewery, a former Tesla executive, is vice president of supply chain at space-transportation startup Astra Space Inc.
Venture capitalists such as Mr. Palihapitiya are pouring billions of dollars into similar startups as part of a green-energy gold rush on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley.
A former Facebook Inc. executive, Mr. Palihapitiya is popular among individual investors and known for backing companies such as Slack Technologies Inc. in their infancy.
In recent years, the Social Capital CEO has used special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, to make big bets on early-stage companies such as personal-finance firm SoFi Technologies Inc. and space-tourism firm Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. while taking them public.
Companies working to fight climate change have also been popular for Mr. Palihapitiya, who sometimes invests in companies personally.

Full text: A 22-foot-high floodwall was supposed to protect Aqua Pennsylvania's water-treatment facility near the Schuylkill River from a 100-year storm. But when the remains of Hurricane Ida barreled through the area near Philadelphia in September, the 18-inch-thick wall proved no match for the record rains.
Waters breached the barrier and inundated the plant. Mud and debris coated offices. Employees rushed to shut down the facility. They barely got out in time, some rolling down car windows in case they got caught in the rising waters and had to leap out, said Chris Franklin, chief executive of Aqua's parent company, Essential Utilities Inc.: "We've never seen destruction like this before."
Across America, historically anomalous weather is overwhelming infrastructure and government systems designed to withstand the weather of the past, forcing cities and utilities to rethink resiliency plans.
In New York City in September, record rains dropped 3.15 inches in an hour in Central Park, overwhelming a sewer system generally built to handle 1.75 inches an hour. In Spokane, Wash., an unprecedented heat wave in June sent temperatures to 109 degrees Fahrenheit, forcing the local electric utility to turn off substation transformers that lose capacity at temperatures higher than 104. In Northern California this summer, a drought dried up reservoirs and reduced hydroelectric power the state counts on to help keep millions of people's lights on.
American cities have been battered by severe weather for generations, but recently many have had to contend with more extreme events, including some they have little experience with, local government officials said. Compounding the problem: infrastructure that has deteriorated in many places, leaving cities with weakened dams, aging pipes and strained electrical grids.
"Our cities and infrastructure . . . are not appropriate for the current situation," said Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist at Columbia University's Earth Institute who developed a climate-change adaptation plan for the New York subway system, adding that harsher weather is here to stay.
Some local governments are pursuing projects to guard a range of infrastructure, including power lines, roads and water systems, against increasing climate threats. New York City is investing more than $20 billion in adaptation efforts to address storm surge, tidal flooding, heavy rainfall and extreme heat. The city of Miami Beach, Fla., is spending roughly $1 billion on a plan to raise roads, lift sea walls and install new pump stations to deal with more-intense downpours.
While the number of weather-related disasters has increased over the past half-century, the number of related deaths has decreased because of improved early warnings and disaster management, according to an August report by the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency.
Growing populations along coasts and into fire-prone wilderness and forests exacerbate the impact of climate change in those areas, scientists say.
Using computer models and troves of data, researchers in the emerging field of attribution science increasingly are linking the types of freak events the world has experienced this year to a warming planet. While natural climate variability plays a role in severe weather, most scientists believe climate change is contributing to greater frequency and potency of such events. They are most confident in connecting climate change to heat waves and somewhat less so linking it to events like hurricanes.
"Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe," the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific panel working under the auspices of the United Nations that assesses thousands of scientific papers, said in a report in August, describing the evidence that humans have helped to heat the planet as unequivocal.
Communities face tough questions over how to pay for upgrading power grids, storm water systems and other aging infrastructure. The U.S. is making only about half of needed investments in infrastructure, and that funding gap is projected to increase to nearly $2.59 trillion over this decade, according to a report this year by the American Society of Civil Engineers.
President Biden has called for the U.S. to make large-scale investments to modernize its public works and mitigate climate-change impacts. On Monday, he signed a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package, which includes around $50 billion in funding for climate-resiliency projects.
Calculating what infrastructure is needed for a future that may be different than the past is difficult, however, as Aqua Pennsylvania learned. It completed a $1 million floodwall to protect its plant near the Schuylkill River in 2010. As the company sought approval for the project, some regulatory-commission staff questioned whether it was an excessive investment, Mr. Franklin said.
The rainfall in September was exactly the kind of event the floodwall was designed for: a 100-year-storm, or one with a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. Still, floodwaters broke through one portion and overtopped the barrier, forcing the plant to close until repairs allowed for a partial reopening. Aqua Pennsylvania said it has restored the breached section of the wall and is considering several options for future flood mitigation but hasn't announced a decision yet.
"We are seeing a steady increase in the amount and the severity of the storms and the impact that it has on customers," said CEO Michael Innocenzo of PECO, an electric and natural-gas utility based in Philadelphia, adding that he saw the trend as persistent.
Ida's remnants brought high winds and tornadoes -- a rarity in that part of the country -- that toppled 290 power poles, said Mr. Innocenzo. Flooding engulfed three electrical substations, forcing two to go offline. Six of the 10 worst storms in the utility's more than 130-year history -- based on the percentage of customer outages -- occurred in the last decade, Mr. Innocenzo said. PECO has more than doubled capital investment in infrastructure over that time to about $1.3 billion this year, driven in part by extreme-weather challenges and including beefed-up design standards for new substations, he said. The weather severity "reinforces the investments that we have been making and makes us continue to look at how we can. . .accelerate those investments."
In New York City, climate-resiliency investments have centered in large part on addressing vulnerabilities to coastal storm surge highlighted by superstorm Sandy in 2012, through initiatives such as a flood-protection project along the eastern side of lower Manhattan.
Ida exposed a different vulnerability: Severe rainfall triggered widespread flooding of streets, subways and basement apartments and prompted the first flash-flood emergency the National Weather Service ever issued in the city. "This was a totally different threat," said Robert Freudenberg, vice president of energy and environment at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit that advocates for infrastructure investments to gird communities for more-intense storms and heat. "Our storm water systems aren't equipped to handle it."
A storm-water resiliency plan that the city released in May said that scientists project intense rainfall to increase in coming decades and that modeling of both moderate and extreme events showed them overwhelming the existing drainage system.
In August, the city completed more than $230 million in drainage improvements in Staten Island, and work is continuing on a $2.2 billion plan launched in 2015 in southeastern Queens to overhaul the area's drainage system.
Consolidated Edison Inc., which provides electricity to about 3.3 million customers in the New York City region, invested heavily in its infrastructure after Sandy and then undertook a study to assess the potential effects of climate change on the system.
CEO Timothy Cawley said two findings grabbed his attention: The study anticipated significant increases in temperature and in sea level. That would almost certainly strain electrical equipment sensitive to high temperatures and render a larger part of the network susceptible to flooding. The utility has reoriented its planning to explicitly account for those contingencies.
"If we have to install a new transformer," Mr. Cawley said, an engineer "is checking to see the expected life of the asset and sea level rise," adding: "Each step we make recognizes that the climate is changing, and we've got to get ready for it."
California's drought has revealed the fragility of its interrelated power and water systems. The California Department of Water Resources, which manages much of the state's water supply, had long anticipated a challenging year, in part because the Sierra Nevada snowpack that feeds into reservoirs was below average levels in the spring.
The situation turned out to be far worse than it anticipated: The snowpack yielded only about 20% of the expected runoff, said John Yarbrough, assistant deputy director for the department's State Water Project. That forced the agency to encourage water users to conserve, find other supplies and begin considering new interconnections to bring in water in anticipation of more dry years to come. It is now working to improve its modeling capabilities and working with the Army Corps of Engineers to better use water and weather forecasts in making operational decisions at reservoirs.
"That translation from snowpack to runoff is a pretty stable relationship that we've observed back historically, until this year," Mr. Yarbrough said. "With climate change, one of the things we're worried about is seeing these stable relationships start breaking down."
The lack of water also crimped hydroelectric power production, which supplied about 16% of California's electricity in 2019, according to state data. The water level at Lake Oroville, which feeds California's largest hydroelectric plant, has lately risen to nearly 669 feet, or 29% capacity. This summer, it reached a record low since it was first filled in 1968 and went offline for the first time in August for lack of water.
That has exacerbated a tight supply on California's power grid, which has been aggressively shedding fossil-fuel electricity generation to meet state climate goals but faces challenges when the sun falls and solar power drops off. The state asked residents to conserve electricity to avoid rolling blackouts several times this summer and recently installed four temporary natural-gas generators at power plants to help alleviate the shortages.
In the Pacific Northwest, where summer weather is so mild that many homes and businesses never installed air conditioning, the June heat wave strained cities and electric utilities. Avista Corp., which provides electricity to nearly 340,000 customers in four Northwestern states, anticipated a demand surge as temperatures crested, reaching a record of 109 degrees in Spokane on June 29, said Heather Rosentrater, Avista's senior vice president of energy delivery.
Managing it proved even more difficult than expected with more people working from home and blasting their AC units, which have become more prevalent in the region in recent years. Four of the company's substation transformers sounded heat alarms, forcing it to take them offline to avoid serious damage to the equipment. About 18,000 customers experienced outages as a result of that and other equipment challenges.
Ms. Rosentrater said the company is considering upgrades to its power-delivery infrastructure and assessing whether it should build its equipment to withstand higher temperatures in anticipation of more severe heat waves in the future. "It was unprecedented," Ms. Rosentrater said. "We haven't had to take these kinds of actions before."
Weather extremes have led governments such as Minnesota's to rethink not only infrastructure, but also vital services that may become more necessary in years to come, such as wildfire protection. In Minnesota, which is experiencing a severe drought, more than 2,000 wildfires have ignited this year, significantly more than the yearly average of 1,172. The fires have so far burned more than 69,000 acres, more than five times the average annual amount, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
Bill Glesener, wildfire-operations supervisor for the department, said the agency has had to borrow personnel to assist with firefighting. The drought has caused the region's many lakes to shrink, forcing crews to rely on portable tanks and increasing the time needed to fight each fire. The agency anticipates having to shift its strategy in anticipation of longer, more-severe fire seasons that might be characterized as "fire years," Mr. Glesener said. "The weather can change on a daily basis, but the climate is there for the long term," he said. "And that's really what we're adjusting our plans for."
A February cold snap caused many of Texas' wind farms and power plants to freeze, resulting in widespread blackouts that left millions shivering and caused the deaths of more than 200 people. The state's Public Utility Commission recently approved weatherization requirements for the power market, devised with help from a state climatologist. A recent report by the climatologist found that Texas will see more extreme heat and more severe storm surges in the next 15 years as a result of climate change.
Commission Chairman Peter Lake didn't draw a connection between climate change and the state's actions, but characterized the previous lack of weatherization standards as skydiving without a backup parachute: The chance of needing one is small but carries critical consequences. "It's very difficult to predict anything, and we've seen that in spades over the last several years," Mr. Lake said. "When it comes to power, you can never guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong, but you can damn sure do a lot better than to live on the fallacy of averages."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping used a virtual meeting Monday evening to cool tensions between their nations as the leaders seek to manage issues in which they disagree and identify ways to communicate to avert conflict.
During a meeting that lasted more than three hours, both sides sought to tamp down on hostilities that have marked the relationship since Mr. Biden took office in January. The White House said the two discussed a range of topics including Afghanistan, North Korea and Iran, as well as human rights, climate change and concerns over Taiwan.
On Taiwan, perhaps the most fraught issue from Beijing's perspective, the White House said Mr. Biden "underscored that the United States remains committed to the 'one China' policy," and that "the United States strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait."
State broadcaster China Central Television said Mr. Biden offered reassurances that the U.S. would "not support 'Taiwan independence'" and that it wouldn't seek to change the Chinese system of government.
"Our responsibility as leaders of China and the United States is to ensure that the competition between our countries doesn't veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended," Mr. Biden said, speaking to his counterpart via video.
Calling the former vice president, his "old friend," Mr. Xi said he wants the U.S. and China to "coexist in peace."
"China and the United States need to increase communication and cooperation," Mr. Xi said.
The president's campaign last year espoused a tough line on China, and Mr. Biden's predecessor, President Trump, launched a trade war with China by raising tariffs on most of U.S. imports.
"China and the United States should respect each other, coexist in peace and pursue win-win cooperation," Mr. Xi said. "I stand ready to work with you, Mr. President, to build consensus, take active steps and move China-U.S. relations forward in a positive direction."
Building off a surprise joint declaration in Glasgow last week pledging cooperation on a transition to cleaner energy, Mr. Biden was expected to seek accord on issues including nuclear proliferation and health amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Trade issues, a major component of the relationship, weren't a major part of the discussion, U.S. officials said. However Mr. Biden called on China to fulfill its commitments under a trade deal that was cut by Mr. Trump, according to a White House readout.
The White House viewed Mr. Biden as entering the meeting with a strong hand. Earlier Monday, he signed a nearly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that he views as essential in keeping up with China's own domestic investments.
Mr. Xi, meanwhile, is focusing his U.S. strategy on damage control rather than resetting the relationship, the people with knowledge of Beijing's thinking said. Mr. Xi's priority is to ensure that the road is smooth, and he is willing to reopen channels of communication with Mr. Biden to prevent military conflict, they say.
"We are at a point where there is some shift under way," said Danny Russel, a former senior official in the Obama administration now with the Asia Society Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. "Both leaders are dissatisfied with the state of the relationship. They are both very mindful that some type of incident could occur that would create a problem that neither can afford right now."
Since Mr. Biden took office, the U.S. has strengthened security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, including a submarine deal signed with the U.K. and Australia in September. The deal showed that some allies, like Australia, are more firmly aligning with the U.S., officials said.

Full text: President Biden is expected to decide as soon as this week whether to appoint Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell or governor Lael Brainard to a four-year term leading the central bank beginning in February.
Because Ms. Brainard's views on inflation and interest rates have been similar this year to Mr. Powell's, policy continuity seems likely no matter who is chosen.
Mr. Biden met each candidate separately for interviews on Nov. 4, and he was joined in the Oval Office for those meetings with only one other adviser, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, according to people familiar with the matter.
Each meeting was scheduled for one hour, though Ms. Brainard's ran slightly over the allotted time, one of these people said. Some people familiar with the matter said Ms. Brainard's meeting went better than expected.
Members of Mr. Biden's economic team and several Democratic lawmakers have favored Mr. Powell for a second term. But resistance from some progressive Democrats, who want someone more committed to toughening financial regulation and addressing climate change at the Fed, has complicated the White House's calculus for months.
Mr. Powell, 68 years old, is a Republican and former private-equity executive who was nominated in 2011 by then-President Barack Obama to join the Fed board and tapped in 2017 by then-President Donald Trump to lead the central bank.
Ms. Brainard, 59, is a Democrat and an economist who joined the Fed in 2014 after working in the Obama Treasury Department and the Clinton White House on international economic issues.
Here is a look at some frequently asked questions about any policy distinctions between them:
How would they differ on monetary policy?
The two appear to be closely aligned. Ms. Brainard has argued at least as forcefully as Mr. Powell that inflationary pressures, which have been caused by pandemic-related disruptions, are likely to abate. This summer, she was an advocate for waiting longer to start winding down the Fed's bond-buying stimulus program than some of her colleagues.
Ms. Brainard was a significant contributor to the revamped policy framework that Mr. Powell unveiled in August 2020, which dropped the Fed's traditional practice of raising rates to pre-empt inflation as the labor market tightened.
Advocates for Ms. Brainard, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, praise her for at times challenging the conventional thinking in macroeconomics and the Fed. In October 2015, Ms. Brainard signaled unease with then-Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's push to raise interest rates from near zero by highlighting risks of weaker global growth and softer inflation, though she voted for the rate increase.
Before and after the pandemic prompted the Fed to cut interest rates to near zero last year, she spoke approvingly of a strategy that might provide additional stimulus once rates were pinned near zero by committing to buy Treasury securities in whatever amounts needed to peg certain yields at low levels. The Fed didn't adopt the approach.
At other junctures, however, Ms. Brainard has signaled greater vigilance than some colleagues against allowing the economy to overheat.
How might they react differently to a period of higher inflation?
It is hard to tell because the current situation is so unusual. Mr. Powell led his colleagues to start reducing asset purchases this month at a pace that, if maintained, would conclude the program by June. The Fed has said it wouldn't want to raise interest rates until after the program ends.
Mr. Powell accelerated the Fed's plans to taper the purchases, as inflation proved more stubborn than anticipated.
Ms. Brainard's recent public statements and comments from economists backing her suggest she is more concerned that the Fed will move too soon rather than too late to pull back its economic-stimulus efforts.
When the Fed was raising rates in September 2018, however, Ms. Brainard said she "would not hesitate" to accelerate the pace of increases if "underlying inflation were to move abruptly and unexpectedly higher."
Are there other policy issues where they have more concrete differences?
Regulation: The most obvious split has been on financial regulation. Since Mr. Powell became chairman in 2018, she has dissented on 23 board votes, often to protest against loosening banking rules imposed after the 2008 financial crisis.
Digital currency: Among the six sitting Fed governors, Ms. Brainard has spoken the most enthusiastically about the central bank adopting a digital dollar while raising warnings about the risks of unregulated private digital money.
In public, Mr. Powell has been more hesitant.
Climate change: Under Mr. Powell, the Fed this year has established two committees designed to evaluate the risks that climate poses to the banking sector and to the financial system as a whole. But he has been sensitive to potential political blowback.
Ms. Brainard has detailed ways for the Fed to direct the biggest banks to manage climate-related risks as part of a broader effort to monitor potential hazards to the financial system. "It's an area where the U.S. has been behind, and we need to catch up," Ms. Brainard said in October.

Full text: International carbon markets got a shot in the arm in Glasgow over the weekend after governments agreed on long-stalled rules for how countries, and companies, can trade carbon-emissions credits across borders.
Negotiations over the carbon agreement were overshadowed at the United Nations climate summit by a higher-profile deal on emissions cuts and climate-change funding. That broader deal asks its190-plus signatories next year to revisit emissions-cutting plans that fell short of what scientists have said is enough to prevent the worst possible effects of climate change. The deal, though, left big questions about how governments will follow through.
The carbon-trading agreement, while narrower in scope, provides businesses with one of the most concrete outcomes of the conference, called COP26. Governments from almost all of the world's countries endorsed on Saturday preliminary rules over how governments and companies can create, value and swap credits to drive their net emissions lower in a global trading system.
"It is unquestionably good news that an agreement has been reached that allows everyone to move forward," said Thomas Lingard, global climate and environment director at Unilever PLC.
Supporters said the broader Glasgow deal -- struck Saturday evening after two weeks of negotiations -- signals new determination among the world's governments to shift away from burning fossil fuels, the main source of greenhouse gases that scientists have said are causing the earth to warm. The agreement, though, features weaknesses that have hamstrung U.N. climate talks over the decades.
It has no enforcement mechanism, relying instead on the good faith of the world's governments to adhere to its rules as best they can. In key areas, it doesn't require nations to act but merely urges or requests them to do so, reflecting wiggle room that was needed to achieve consensus among all governments.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reflected the disappointment of many delegates in not getting more concrete commitments through a process that required signoff from almost all of the world's governments.
"The approved texts are a compromise," he said. "They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today."
The broader deal asks governments to strengthen their emissions-reduction targets by the end of next year to keep them in line with what scientists think is necessary to meet the climate target of the 2015 Paris accord: keeping global warming well under 2 degrees Celsius, and close to 1.5 degrees, compared with preindustrial-era temperatures.
Governments had failed to agree to cuts sufficient to hit that target ahead of the summit. The review next year was seen by delegates who pushed it as a way of wringing fresh cuts from some countries in the near future.
Hours after nations approved it, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry underscored the deal's fundamental weakness: He said the U.S., the world's second-largest emitter, was unlikely to speed up its own reduction plan in a year's time, arguing that it goes far enough. "The language is 'as necessary,' and I don't expect it's going to be necessary," he said.
Part of the narrower carbon-trading agreement is aimed at creating a U.N.-certified credit that can be accounted for around the world. A standardized credit should allow governments to access regulated and more informal carbon markets that already exist and are used widely by companies. A government that can't meet emissions plans it submitted to the U.N. could buy credits to make up the difference.
"The rules help to define the framework for how governments can use the private sector to support them in meeting their climate targets," said Enric Arderiu Serra, head of environmental products at trading giant Mercuria Energy Trading SA.
Uncertainties around carbon accounting have slowed the expansion of these markets, said Dirk Forrister, president of the International Emissions Trading Association, a trade group. "The Glasgow market framework can unleash a whole new wave of investment as companies leverage the trading tools," he said.
The rules are part of what has been called Article 6 of the Paris accord, signed in 2015. Ever since, governments have squabbled over them.
A deal has faltered in past summits, amid fighting about what could be considered double-counting of the same credit by countries. Another stumbling block has been whether to allow countries to use older credits, from a now-defunct earlier trading system.
A global carbon market won't happen overnight. The agreement first invites nominations for a supervisory body to oversee the marketplace. Once that body is selected, it is slated to meet at least twice next year to develop technical methodologies, registration and monitoring processes.
The current patchwork of carbon markets includes ones set up and regulated by governments, such as the European Union's Emissions Trading System and similar markets in China and California.
In these markets, heavy-emitting industries such as utilities are given limits for how much carbon they can emit. If they stay under that, they can sell the extra to others who are emitting more than their ceiling. The new rules could lead to the linking up of regional trading schemes.
Parallel to these regulated markets are more informal carbon-offset markets, where companies participate voluntarily in activities such as planting trees and restoring peatlands, or funding others to do so.
These projects generate credits that can be traded among companies to drive down their own net emissions -- something regulators, investors and consumers are increasingly calling for.
Many companies already buy carbon-offset credits, including Microsoft Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Nestle SA. These offset credits can be certified by third parties who record the projects and credits and confirm they meet certain standards.
The U.N. plan would provide a framework to harmonize all of these markets under generally accepted standards, for instance, about what sort of projects qualify for credits and how much carbon they offset. Critics of informal markets complain they aren't consistent in terms of standards.
Microsoft, noting the inconsistency of how offsets are verified, developed last year its own due-diligence process to ascertain that credits it was trading were of a certain standard.
"At its best, Article 6 has the potential to be an important driver of carbon finance, clean energy, and carbon removal," said Elizabeth Willmott, carbon program director at Microsoft.

Full text: GLASGOW -- U.S. climate envoy John Kerry helped win support at the United Nations summit for a deal this weekend that aims to accelerate emissions-cutting plans and asks countries to strengthen them again next year.
Hours later, Mr. Kerry underscored the fundamental weakness of the new agreement when he said the U.S., the world's second-largest greenhouse-gas emitter, is unlikely to speed up its own reduction plan in a year's time, arguing that it goes far enough.
"That's stretching the limits right now," he said.
The complex deal, signed by more than 190 governments Saturday evening in Glasgow after two weeks of talks, represented a heightened effort by the world's rich and poor countries alike to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in hopes of avoiding catastrophic global warming.
The provision that governments pledge bigger emissions cuts by the end of next year was an acknowledgment that recent targets set by countries fall substantially short of what is necessary to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement. It calls for countries to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels, and preferably 1.5 degrees.
But the Glasgow deal has no real enforcement mechanism and only asks for new plans "as necessary," giving countries plenty of discretion on whether to do more. Scientists say the reductions needed to avert highly destructive climate change must happen so quickly that few countries can afford to leave their targets unchanged in the coming year.
Strengthening the plans is likely to be a tall order. The policies President Biden needs to meet the current U.S. goal are coming along only slowly, and Congress has yet to approve the billions of dollars needed to help. China, the world's biggest emitter, is unlikely to change its headline targets in the coming year, officials say. Other major emitters have been similarly reluctant.
Climate Action Tracker, a scientific consortium that evaluates governments' emissions plans, says both the U.S.'s and China's plans are insufficient to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, which underpins much of what governments negotiated in Glasgow.
The need for quick follow-up sets up a year of negotiations going into the next U.N. climate summit, scheduled for November 2022 in Egypt. U.S. officials sought the accelerated timelines as a tool for keeping up pressure on China, India and some other big polluters in the developing world. Poorer nations that are seen as most vulnerable to climate change look to all the biggest polluters -- both developed and developing countries -- to cut emissions more sharply.
"Our main issue on emissions is not about the developing or developed world," said Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Fiji's climate minister. "It's: Who are the high emitters? They're the ones that need to invest."
The Glasgow agreement also pressures the U.S. to boost its funding to help developing countries respond to climate change. Developed nations agreed to at least double the amount of finance to poorer nations by 2025 to help them adapt to global warming effects. Here, too, the administration is counting on Congress to appropriate the money it needs to fulfill the Glasgow pledges.
Delegates from poorer nations left Saturday's sessions saying they will spend the next year pushing rich nations to deliver on those financial commitments, which wealthier countries have largely failed to do in prior climate deals. They are tying those financial demands to other parts of climate diplomacy, saying they won't be able to limit their emissions without those funds, delegates said.
The origins of Saturday's deal came out of contingency plans the U.S. and the European Union began pushing as the conference neared its second week. They had exhausted efforts to get a few big developing countries to come up with deeper cuts and began instead pushing for a deal to speed up timelines set under the Paris climate accord of 2015 for delivering updated plans to cut emissions.
While Paris requires updates every five years -- a task just finished in Glasgow -- the Glasgow deal asks for new targets by the end of next year to keep them in line with the temperature goals of the Paris accord. The U.N. says current plans would allow carbon dioxide emissions to rise 13% by 2030 compared with 2010. Scientists say they must fall 45% to hit the 1.5 degree target. Now countries must effectively go back to the drawing board to strengthen commitments that were already going to be difficult in some cases to meet.

Full text: GLASGOW -- The surprise announcement that the U.S. and China would cooperate on accelerating a transition to cleaner energy came after both President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping encouraged their delegates to find common ground ahead of a virtual summit, according to people familiar with the negotiation.
The announcement came as the global COP26 climate conference entered its final days, with delegates eager to show progress in the fight against global warming. Many see commitments from Messrs. Biden and Xi, leaders of the world's two largest economies and largest greenhouse-gas emitters, as necessary to get other nations to consent to common and more aggressive goals in closing agreements.
Both men have made addressing climate change a policy priority, and they have staked their credibility as international leaders on their ability to offer fixes to global challenges. But at home, Mr. Biden has struggled to push his ambitious climate agenda through Congress, and his administration is wrestling with how to curb rising gas prices without backing down from its commitment to transition away from fossil fuels.
Mr. Xi wants a less volatile relationship with Washington as he focuses on domestic politics -- specifically, claiming an unprecedented third term at a party conclave set for late 2022.
The climate agreement was, to many observers, uninspiring, but is the latest sign of a thaw in U.S.-China relations. It followed a resumption of high-level trade talks between the two nations and a recent deal by the U.S. Justice Department that led to the release of Huawei Technologies Co. finance chief Meng Wanzhou, who had been detained in Canada.
"This creates a better, more positive environment for President Biden and President Xi ahead of their virtual summit," said David Sandalow, a former U.S. Department of Energy official and founder of the U.S.-China Program at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. "Hugely difficult issues still dominate the relationship, but this underscores that the two countries can find common ground."
The virtual summit is expected to take place next week.
In their joint statement from Glasgow, the U.S. and China agreed to both do more to curtail emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
The U.S. and China said they would set up a climate working group and meet next year "to focus on the specifics of enhancing measurement and mitigation of methane, including through standards to reduce methane from the fossil and waste sectors," the statement said.
Neither China nor the U.S. further accelerated its timeline for emissions cuts compared with what each had laid out in submissions to the United Nations this year. Nor did either side promise to phase out fossil fuels, a quest for many governments here, especially the European Union.
"Both sides still fall well short of what's needed in ambition and implementation." said Li Shuo, a policy adviser at Greenpeace, though he credited the two countries for their cooperative spirit.
The U.S.-China partnership was once fundamental to creating the Paris Agreement, but relations frayed under former President Donald Trump and remained contentious as the Biden administration held to an aggressive posture.
Viewed in that light, the joint statement was "a helpful shot in the arm for the final COP26 negotiations over the coming days," said Thom Woodroofe, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.
The White House views climate as an area of potential cooperation in its otherwise prickly relationship with China, which has been characterized this year by clashes over trade, human rights and the pandemic.
The joint statement released late Wednesday followed months of negotiations between former Secretary of State John Kerry, Mr. Biden's climate envoy, and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua.
The two men have known each other for more than a decade and were instrumental in taking the Paris Agreement over the line in 2015. Their teams made formal contact within the first few weeks of the Biden administration and Messrs. Kerry and Xie have spoken almost every other week on the phone.

Full text: EMALAHLENI, South Africa -- The gleaming new chimneys and hulking generators of what will soon be the second-largest coal-fired power plant in the Southern Hemisphere are at the center of South Africa's $20 billion, 50-year bet to fuel economic growth and lift its population out of poverty.
Now, South Africa and its Kusile Power Station have also become a test case for whether rich nations can help poorer ones transition away from the dirtiest fossil fuel.
At the international climate summit in Glasgow, meeting host U.K. has called on negotiators from nearly every country to "consign coal power to history" as part of a broader ambition to cut global greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero by 2050. That, climate scientists say, is indispensable for limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial levels and containing the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
Major economies, including the U.S., the European Union and most recently China, have banned state lenders from financing overseas coal projects. Multilateral development banks and commercial lenders are following suit, making it more difficult to find funding not only for new plants but also for maintaining existing ones. The U.S. and EU are also moving to impose tariffs on imports based on the carbon dioxide emitted during their production, making goods from coal-dependent economies less competitive.
This pressure to end coal-powered electricity generation has fired tensions between developed nations, which industrialized thanks to the inexpensive and reliable energy source, and developing ones, which have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into new coal infrastructure. Global coal capacity, now responsible for close to 40% of electricity generation world-wide, has nearly doubled since the turn of the millennium, with much of the growth coming from emerging economies, including China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.
At the nexus of this standoff are countries like South Africa, which gets more than 80% of its electricity and nearly one-fifth of its liquid fuel from coal and says it lacks the money to overhaul its power system while repairing its pandemic-ravaged economy.
One of the top-10 coal producers in the world, the country has spent the equivalent of 6% of its annual gross domestic product on two huge coal-fired power plants that will only become fully operational in the coming years. It is the most coal-dependent country in the Group of 20 major economies.
It is also suffering some of the most extreme effects of climate change. Average temperatures in South Africa are 1.7 degrees Celsius higher than at the start of the 20th century, compared with around 0.9 degrees globally. Scientists say severe droughts, such as the one that saw Cape Town nearly run out of water three years ago, heat waves and flooding have already become more frequent.
South Africa's government says it is willing to help achieve the 1.5 degree target -- provided that wealthy countries, along with international development banks, come up with more than 400 billion rand ($26.6 billion) to transform its power system.
At the summit, the U.S., Germany, France, the U.K. and the EU said they would mobilize $8.5 billion over the next three to five years to help South Africa quit coal, including by replacing coal plants with renewable energy and finding new livelihoods for mining communities.
The participating governments said the financing pledge, the first of its kind globally, could become a blueprint for encouraging other coal-dependent developing countries to move away from the severely polluting fuel.
The International Energy Agency estimates that developing economies will have to retire coal plants at about half of their historic lifespan -- just 25 years -- to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The average retirement age of advanced economies' plants under the same scenario will be 40 years.
Key elements of the South Africa deal, including how much of the funding will come from governments rather than private investors and what kind of interest rates they would charge, are yet to be decided.
In his own speech at the summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called the deal an "important breakthrough" but suggested that more help was needed to decarbonize his country's economy. "Our ability to do so will be determined by the extent of support that we receive from developed economies," he said.
The reverberations from the global energy shift are felt in places like eMalahleni, a scattered industrial town of around 450,000 people whose name translates to "place of coal" from the Zulu language. Entire neighborhoods, many consisting of corrugated-iron shacks without proper access to electricity, abut open-pit coal mines and mining dumps.
Eight coal-fired power plants within a 35-mile radius of the city have been the engine of South Africa's broader mining and industrial sectors for decades. A thin layer of soot coats anything left outside and pollution can color the sky gray-brown for days.
Just off the highway connecting eMalahleni to Johannesburg, state power company Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. is building Kusile Power Station, a 4,800-megawatt steel-and-concrete behemoth expected to become fully operational in 2025. Like its near-identical sister plant Medupi Power Station -- located close to South Africa's border with Botswana and financed in part through a $3.75 billion loan from the World Bank -- Kusile's estimated lifespan is another 50 years.
Greenpeace and other environmental groups say that the Mpumalanga Highveld, the inland plateau surrounding eMalahleni, suffers some of the highest levels of air pollution on the planet. Every year, more than 2,000 South Africans die prematurely from illnesses caused or exacerbated by air pollution emissions from the coal industry, according to studies by government researchers and environmental groups.
"I have to choose between my husband's work, which puts food on the table and buys medicine for my child, and her health," said Mbali Mathebula, whose older daughter, Princess, regularly suffers asthma attacks. Her younger daughter, Asemahle, is starting to show symptoms of the disease. "It's not a choice I want to make."
Ms. Mathebula's husband, Jabu Mamayila, works at Secunda Synfuels Operations, a giant apartheid-era plant owned by Johannesburg-listed Sasol Ltd. that turns coal into liquid fuel and, according to data from the EU's satellite observation program, is the largest single emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. Sasol said it doesn't know how Secunda's emissions compare with other plants globally. It plans to cut companywide greenhouse-gas emissions by 30% by 2030, compared with 2017 levels.
For many South Africans, the region's smokestacks and mining pits have long held the promise of a better future in a country where the official unemployment rate has reached a record 34.4%. Household incomes here are 25% above the national average and nearly half of the local economy and one in four formal jobs depend directly or indirectly on the coal industry, according to Trade & Industrial Policy Strategies, a Pretoria-based research institute.
Mlungisi Paul, a 36-year-old father of three, watched his older brother build a life as a coal miner, as unions with close ties to the ruling African National Congress ensured higher wages and better job security. "I saw him doing it, so I also wanted to do it," said Mr. Paul.
For three years, Mr. Paul shoveled coal onto a conveyor belt at a local power station. Then he found a post at a nearby mine, earning a monthly salary of 9,500 rand, nearly three times the South African minimum wage. As investment in the South African coal-mining industry dropped by almost half over the past decade, Mr. Paul's contract expired and he hasn't found a job since.
"I know sometimes people strike because of the environment, but I just want to work," he said.
In contrast to other major coal-dependent developing economies -- including China and India -- South Africa has promised to slash its greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of the decade. In a new pledge submitted in September, the government said it would lower its 2030 emissions by as much as 27% compared with 2017 levels.
That plan, which has won plaudits from the U.S. and other rich countries advocating a quicker phaseout of coal, places South Africa at the beginning of a difficult path to overhaul its power system.
Modeling from Meridian Economics, a Cape Town-based consulting firm whose director is an adviser to President Ramaphosa, shows that reducing South Africa's emissions in line with the 1.5 degree target would require all of the country's power generation from coal to be shut down by around 2040.
That is around three decades before the end of the 50-year lifespan of Medupi and Kusile and, without aggressive investment into alternative energy sources now, would leave the country with fresh gaps in its already-troubled electricity supply.
Some three million households in South Africa -- a country of 60 million people -- aren't connected to the electricity grid. For more than a decade, the economy has also been plagued by rolling blackouts, sometimes leaving major cities such as Johannesburg and Cape Town without electricity for more than seven hours a day.
Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe, a former union leader who is also the chairman of the ruling ANC, has warned that abandoning coal would be "economic suicide" for South Africa. His department's own climate and energy plans still foresee the construction of new coal plants to replace old ones.
Speaking at an energy conference on Tuesday, Mr. Mantashe said the rich countries' $8.5 billion pledge was good, but shouldn't impose conditions on South Africa's energy plans. "We are a developing economy," he said. "Our biggest challenge is access to reliable, secure energy supply. We don't have that yet."
Globally, reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 will require a quadrupling of the annual pace of coal-power retirement in the decade to 2030 compared with the previous 10 years, according to the IEA. In the decade to 2040, 80% of retired capacity will have to come from developing and emerging economies, the agency says.
How rich countries support poorer ones in this effort will decide the future of regions like eMalahleni, where the South African government says it wants to preserve jobs by retrofitting coal plants with electricity generation from gas and solar panels. It also needs to rebuild transmission and distribution lines to make them compatible with renewable energy sources, according to a recent presentation by a senior official in President Ramaphosa's office.
Jesse Burton, a Cape Town-based senior associate at international climate and energy think tank E3G, says the $8.5 billion pledged in Glasgow is a promising first step toward aiding South Africa's energy transition. Whether it will be successful depends on how much of the funding is new money coming from the participating governments, how much will be in grants rather than loans and what proportion private investors are expected to contribute.
"We've seen that developed countries promise money and then don't deliver it," said Ms. Burton.
In eMalahleni, residents fighting the South African government to reduce dangerous air pollution are asking a similar question. "Canceling this whole thing of coal to go green is a good thing, but when are we starting?" said Promise Mabilo, whose 26-year-old son has battled with asthma for much of his life. "There is a lot of talking but less implementation."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping plan to hold a virtual summit on Monday, as the two leading world economies pledge to work together on climate change but differences remain over Taiwan and other fronts, people familiar with the matter said.
The leaders have spoken twice since Mr. Biden took office in January, the last time in September, though the summit is expected to resemble a more formal bilateral meeting with staff involvement.
One person closely tracking the negotiations and in contact with U.S. officials said climate, trade and nuclear nonproliferation, as well as Taiwan and cybersecurity issues, are among those that could be discussed.
The White House had yet to formally announce a date or agenda. The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment.
Messrs. Biden and Xi have expressed a desire to work together, and the U.S. and China just forged a surprise joint declaration to address climate change as part of talks in Glasgow, which raises expectations for a more cooperative tone next week.
Still, the relationship has been mostly characterized by a back-and-forth on trade, security and human rights, continuing a buildup of tensions that began under former President Donald Trump. Republicans and Democrats in Congress are increasingly critical of China, adding pressure on the Biden administration.
Tensions have grown between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, with Beijing conducting dozens of recent air missions near the island. The sorties followed a series of international maritime patrols led by an aircraft carrier from the U.K. and ships from the U.S. and other nations.
Washington is concerned over China's continued military buildup, including the testing of a hypersonic weapon and Beijing's plans to have more than 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. China also appears to have built models with the dimensions of a U.S. aircraft carrier and other warships for military training.
Beijing, meanwhile, has seen the U.S. bolster security pacts with allies in the Indo-Pacific and forge economic bonds with Asian countries. It has bristled at U.S. condemnations of the treatment of mainly Muslim Uyghurs in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. China wants the Biden administration to remove Trump-era tariffs, but the U.S. has mainly kept them in place while saying it welcomes trade talks.

Full text: Rising oil prices have handed President Biden a dilemma at a politically precarious time.
His administration's ambitious agenda to stem global warming calls for a shift away from fossil fuels. Yet Mr. Biden is urging the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production to ease shortages and lower prices.
OPEC has so far rebuffed those appeals. And with gasoline and heating-oil prices at their highest levels since 2014, Americans are expressing unease over the administration's economic policies as next year's midterm elections loom.
"High prices tend to usher out incumbent politicians faster than they usher in new technologies," said Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners LLC.
The White House has limited options for a quick fix. What's more, Mr. Biden's calls for OPEC to pump more oil have opened him to brickbats from the domestic oil industry, which says his energy policies aimed at slowing climate change will worsen shortages.
"The solution to lowering Americans' energy costs is not supporting OPEC," said Anne Bradbury, chief executive of the American Exploration and Production Council. "It's supporting America's energy workers and made-in-America oil and natural gas."
White House advisers have been debating for weeks over how to respond to rising oil and gasoline prices, according to people familiar with the situation. Gasoline prices Tuesday averaged $3.42 a gallon nationally, and $4.63 a gallon in California, according to the AAA auto club.
In a statement Wednesday, Mr. Biden took note of the rising energy costs and the impact on American households. "I have directed my National Economic Council to pursue means to try to further reduce these costs, and have asked the Federal Trade Commission to strike back at any market manipulation or price gouging in this sector," the president said.
Some senior advisers, including National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, have proposed releasing oil from the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve, these people say. Mr. Deese didn't respond to requests to comment.
White House officials also mulled a suggestion that national security adviser Jake Sullivan send out a series of rapid-fire tweets slamming OPEC for not pumping more oil, the people said, but ultimately rejected the idea. President Donald Trump used that tactic with some success to soften oil markets.
At the Glasgow climate summit last week, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry was asked how the Biden administration can call on other countries to pump more oil and phase out fossil fuels at the same time.
Mr. Kerry said the president's policy was consistent. "He's asking them to boost production in the immediate moment," Mr. Kerry said. "And as the transition cuts in, there won't be that need as you deploy the solar panels, as you deploy the transmission lines, as you build out the grid."
Oil industry leaders and others have seized on the issue, saying Mr. Biden is trying to push a transition to alternative energy when the world still depends on fossil fuels.
One of Mr. Biden's first acts in office was to revoke a permit for TC Energy Corp.'s Keystone XL pipeline, shutting down a project that would have carried oil from Canada to U.S. refiners.
This week, the White House said it was conducting environmental and market reviews that could shut down the Line 5 pipeline that carries Canadian oil and natural-gas liquids through Michigan to Ontario, over concerns that an underwater pipeline leak could hurt fisheries and threaten drinking water. The White House later backed away from the possibility it might close the line.
Public opinion polls have shown declining approval numbers for Mr. Biden, which analysts attribute to a variety of factors including rising gas prices and inflation.
Domestic oil and gas producers have yet to turn up production as they did several times during other recent price spikes.
The shale drillers responsible for the last decade's boom are now under pressure to repay debt and generate better returns for investors, giving them little incentive to spend money to pump more oil, according to Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Foreign producers are also benefiting from rising prices and fearful of oversupplying the market, giving them little incentive to cooperate.
"We must keep the price. Iraq needs the money . . . for its stability," Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said in an interview last week. He predicted oil might go as high as $120 a barrel by next summer, up from about $80 currently.
Another option, curtailing natural-gas exports, would have limited impact because export volumes are relatively small and bound by low capacity, while also irritating U.S. trading partners.
The Energy Information Administration has forecast that the average U.S. household that relies on natural gas for heating will pay 30% more for the fuel this year.
With heating oil prices also high, lawmakers have called on the Biden administration to consider tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep home heating costs in check as winter approaches. Some administration officials believe such a release could be hard to justify, according to people familiar with the matter. While oil and gasoline prices are rising, supplies are still ample, undermining the intent of the reserve as an emergency supply.

Full text: GLASGOW -- The U.S. and China jointly pledged at the United Nations climate summit to step up actions to fight climate change in the coming decade, injecting talks here with a surprise show of cooperation between the two rivals and the world's two biggest greenhouse-gas emitters.
But the two didn't endorse a proposal by the U.K., the host of the summit, floated for countries to update their emissions-cutting plans by the end of next year. That proposal was seen as a way of bridging the divide between how much governments have committed to cut and what scientists think is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
In an unusual joint statement, Washington and Beijing pledged to work together on a number of fronts, including on reducing methane emissions. China hasn't joined a U.S.-led coalition that pledged last week to reduce methane emissions.
"Every step matters right now, and we have a long journey ahead of us," U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said. The release of a joint declaration "shows that cooperation is the only choice between China and the United States," said China's special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua.
The bilateral move comes in the final stretch of the two-week climate summit here. The U.S. and China are coming under pressure from poorer countries to bring their emissions-cutting plans in line with what scientists say is needed to fulfill the Paris accord. That agreement, signed in 2015, calls for governments to strive to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees, compared with pre-industrial-era temperatures, by the end of the century. The U.N. says plans submitted under the agreement put the world on track for 2.7 degrees of warming.
"The statement is not enough to close the deal," said Bernice Lee, research director at Chatham House, a think tank in London. "The real test of Washington and Beijing is how hard they push for a 1.5-Celsius-aligned deal here in Glasgow."
The U.K.'s proposal urges the world's governments to commit by the end of 2022 to deeper cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, in what would be a major acceleration of their schedules.
The proposal, however, didn't go far enough for some nations most vulnerable to climate change.
"Urging, encouraging and inviting is not decisive language," said Aubrey Webson, a diplomat from Antigua and Barbuda who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States.
Closing the emissions gap isn't the only obstacle facing negotiators in the final days of summit talks. Developing countries are seeking strong commitments from wealthy nations to provide more funds for them to adopt renewable energy, protect themselves from the effects of climate change, such as drought and rising sea levels.
"We remain extremely concerned with the lack of progress on finance issues," said Diego Pacheco, a Bolivian negotiator and spokesman for the group of Like-Minded Developing Countries, which includes China and India. "There is no appetite in our partners, developed countries, to get engaged in a fruitful discussion regarding long-term finance."
Separate draft agreements released by the U.K. on Tuesday and Wednesday also outlined a possible deal over the rules of the Paris accord of 2015, one of the summit's key objectives. The texts, though, suggested wide differences between governments over these issues that are crucial to achieving the Paris agreement targets.
The text in one draft released by the U.K. on Wednesday calls for governments to accelerate the phaseout of fossil-fuel subsidies and coal. Such language has in the past prompted stiff objections from big fossil-fuel exporters such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, and hasn't made it into previous climate deals.
One text released on Wednesday is a draft of the summit's "cover," or headline, deal -- envisioned to be signed by more than 190 nations -- and puts on paper what was essentially a Plan B for hitting the Paris agreement climate targets, after all major emitters presented their climate plans and, according to the U.N., came up short.

Full text: The Biden administration is looking to deepen U.S. cooperation with Cairo on thorny regional security problems as well as in economic and climate areas, a step toward closer ties after years of political turmoil in Egypt and accusations of human-rights abuses.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, kicking off the first set of talks called a strategic dialogue with Egypt since 2015, listed hot spots in the Middle East and Horn of Africa where Washington is working with Cairo.
"One reason the relationship is strong is because we're not merely maintaining it, but consistently expanding the areas where we cooperate," Mr. Blinken said in remarks with his counterpart, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry.
Promising more frequent in-depth gatherings with Egypt, the top U.S. diplomat also outlined a new economic framework with the country that would complement the existing trade and investment framework and address climate change and renewable energy ahead of the next United Nations climate conference, expected to be held in Egypt in a year, a State Department spokesman said.
The business environment in Egypt has suffered under President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, who has expanded the role of the military and other security forces in the economy, squeezing out the private sector, business figures and Western officials said. Government and military spending on construction projects has produced modest growth in the broader economy, but government statistics show most Egyptians have become poorer in recent years.
Egypt's nonoil private sector contracted for the 10th month in a row in September, according to IHS Markit's purchasing managers index, a measure of business activity.
The administration's efforts to improve ties with Egypt come just eight weeks after the State Department withheld $130 million out of a total of $300 million in military aid over Egypt's human-rights record. Total U.S. aid to Egypt amounts to more than $1 billion a year, and policy experts in both parties saw the move to withhold some of the military assistance as a compromise.
The Biden administration has sought to make human rights and democracy a touchstone of its foreign policy. President Biden has criticized increasingly authoritarian regimes in Beijing and Moscow and is planning to convene a summit of democracies this year. During the presidential election, Mr. Biden vowed to cut off what he called "blank checks for Trump's favorite dictator."
That effort has at times complicated the Biden team's efforts to work more closely with partner countries to resolve regional problems, especially in the Middle East.
This summit showed how the administration has come to give priority to security and geopolitical aims over human-rights concerns in the relationship with Cairo, close observers of the talks said.
"Unfortunately the commitment to human rights hasn't escaped the rhetorical. From their perspective, Egypt serves purposes that they give priority to over everything else," said Timothy Kaldas, a policy fellow at the Washington-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.

Full text: From the Journal website's Future View column, in which students were asked what climate summits accomplish:
For Greta Thunberg, the COP26 climate summit has been a "two-week long celebration of business as usual." Politicians have bloviated about the consequences of inaction while cutting back-room deals for raw materials, even as celebrities chartered jets to speak about "multi-stakeholder decarbonization initiatives."
Ms. Thunberg's cynicism about climate theater is not misplaced. China and Russia have been notably absent. Political scientists tend to view with deep suspicion such nonbinding agreements as those reached at COP26 on deforestation. Everyone agrees it is untenable to ask developing nations to halt development for the sake of reducing global emissions.
-- Addis Goldman, University of Chicago, international relations
Climate summits could be instrumental in fighting climate change -- if they were conducted in an honest way. COP26 shows that these types of gatherings are often purely symbolic. World leaders participate to appeal to their constituents by giving the appearance of taking action and being important. Meanwhile, ambiguous, easy-to-accomplish long-term goals are set, with no accountability. If China and other world polluters actually attended, and if the meetings produced significant agreements that could be submitted as legislation and implemented quickly, we would be better off in the fight against climate change.
-- Isaac Speights, University of North Texas, psychology
The COP26 summit is a disenchanting exhibition of corporate semantics and international posturing. It is hardly surprising that a conference sponsored by multinational corporations-technology giant Microsoft and Scottish pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, for example-would eschew radicalism.
As difficult as it would be to quantify the effect of these sponsorships, we cannot suppose that such partners as the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi and the British grocery chain Sainsbury's have nothing to gain. At the least, these companies can present themselves as adjacent to climate-change activism and gain reputationally, regardless of whether they lead their respective industries in sustainable practices.
-- Luca Zislin, University of California, Berkeley, political science and English

Full text: Look out any window in most urban areas and you'll see streets lined with parked cars. Every year the arteries of the world's biggest cities become more clogged. By 2030, 60% of the world's population will live in cities, analysts estimate, creating a string of global megacities even more crowded and polluted than today. How will they organize daily life to promote safety, efficiency and the well-being of residents?
Now imagine a city without private cars. A city where transportation is emissions-free, largely self-driving and connected to the internet. A city where cars, as well as taxis, buses, trains and bicycles, are shared. Instead of parked cars and concrete, city streets might be filled with mini parks, markets and more.
Several trends are visible today that could bring about these reimagined transportation networks: the rising popularity of electric cars, a regulatory environment that is increasingly geared toward fighting climate change, and advances in technology from electric and self-driving vehicles to the spread of the Internet of Things.
Many obstacles exist. Autonomous cars are still more theory than reality today. Cities will have to pony up huge investments in new public transportation infrastructure. They will have to make technology and policy choices today to make car-free living easier for residents, including restricting private car ownership within the city, levying higher taxes on carbon emissions, making parking prohibitively expensive and shifting regulations and urban planning to favor shared, autonomous vehicles. And it isn't certain that the public will give up owning cars.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, McKinsey & Co., Deloitte, KPMG and others have outlined visions of what a city with greatly reduced personal car ownership would look like. Follow the urban dweller Bonnie as she heads home from a day at the office in 2040.
1. The Internet Of Everything
Before leaving the office, Bonnie books her commute -- a shared bicycle to an automated train to a driverless shuttle that will take her to her door -- via an app that is connected to a vast Internet of Things. Much of this technology has been available for years, but in 2040 it is ubiquitous. Buildings, vehicles and transportation infrastructure are all linked, able to share widely and easily on ultrafast wireless networks. Self-driving vehicles communicate with traffic lights, for example, easing the flow of traffic and potentially preventing jams. Bonnie and other pedestrians wear connected clothing that warns vehicles of their presence, preventing many accidents and identifying her to the transportation she uses so her digital preferences can be installed automatically. Two big trends in the 2020s and 2030s drove this shift: the digitization of everything and the drive to eliminate greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.
2. A View of the City
When she looks out her office window, Bonnie sees only a handful of cars. The din of engines and honking horns has almost disappeared: Vehicles operating within city limits are electric, and public transportation and taxis are self-driving. Years ago, Bonnie's city restricted private vehicle ownership within city limits and greatly expanded mass transit to fill the need. Where parked cars once clogged the streets, the city planted trees and built networks of hyperlocal transportation hubs.
3. Head to the Hub
Bonnie heads toward a local transportation hub, a drop-off point for several modes of transportation residents use to get around the neighborhood, including shared bicycles, electric scooters and driverless shuttles. Faster trains and robotaxis are available for longer distances.
4. The App-based Commute
When Bonnie approaches the parked bicycle, it recognizes her and unlocks. Apps connecting modes of transportation emerged more than 20 years earlier, but by 2040 they are more connected-platforms for collaboration between transportation companies and businesses offering services, such as charging vehicles on the fly, repairs, or advertising tailored toward individual passengers using augmented reality. Bonnie has chosen the premium option for her travel plan, a monthly subscription for all forms of transportation.
5. Personal Preferences
Bonnie's premium plan includes a private pod on the train. After arriving at the station and taking her seat, the train's network identifies her and adjusts the environment -- the seat, lighting and temperature -- according to her profile preferences. Screens in the pod automatically connect to her digital world, allowing her to instantly access work files or personal apps. She can check the fridge at home, order groceries online and time a delivery to arrive at her destination when she does.
6. Board the Shuttle
Bonnie gets off at the train station near her home. A self-driving shuttle is waiting to take her the last stretch of the way. Like the train, it adjusts the environment to her preferences and grants her access to her digital world. Bonnie has a conference call with a customer in her calendar. The shuttle establishes the connection at the appropriate time and Bonnie conducts her meeting. At the end of the drive, the vehicle's digital assistant asks Bonnie about several appointments in her calendar the next day and whether she needs to book a shuttle. Also, her daughter has scheduled a pod to go to her karate lesson but still needs Bonnie's permission to complete the booking.
7. Arrive Home
Bonnie's shuttle informs her smart house of her coming arrival. When she gets home, the lights are on and the temperature is just how she likes it. A drone carrying the groceries she ordered en route is waiting for her.
8. Two Visions
If cities make the kinds of choices that Bonnie's hometown did, 40% of all miles traveled by 2040 will be with shared mobility services, McKinsey predicts. If not, McKinsey says, the lack of regulation promoting emissions-free and connected transportation and inertia in consumer behavior could result in a world in which private car ownership falls only 10% by 2040. That will make it even harder to roll out technology and transport system changes and reduce emissions.

Full text: Business lobbyists are pushing to derail about $800 billion in new taxes that come with President Biden's spending bill, but along with opposition from Democrats they are facing an added challenge: division within their own ranks.
The largest Washington industry associations including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce oppose Mr. Biden's roughly $2 trillion package. But some major U.S. companies are on the sidelines, in part because they support provisions in the bill to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars to combat climate change.
Companies backing the climate measures include General Motors Co., Cummins Inc. and Carrier Global Corp. along with some Wall Street firms and Silicon Valley companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., as Facebook rebranded itself.
Cummins, which makes diesel and alternative-fuel engines and power equipment, said its support for federal spending on climate-change measures outweighs its opposition to the tax increases.
"Obviously there are elements that we dislike, but overall we support it, primarily driven by those climate-change provisions," said Jon Mills, a spokesman for the Indiana-based company.
Other executives said that while they don't support the tax increases, they won't lobby against them so as not to jeopardize the chance that the climate-change measures are enacted. That has undercut what might otherwise be solid business opposition to Mr. Biden's tax-and-spending plan.
The decision by the companies to refrain from lobbying against the broader Democratic proposal to win funding for climate measures is the latest sign of changes in American businesses.
In years past, companies typically gave priority to public policy matters that affected their bottom lines, such as opposing tax increases and new regulations. Now, more companies are wading into other issues such as community policing and funding for social services.
The bill addresses many parts of the president's agenda, including roughly $555 billion to address global warming and measures aimed at reducing income inequality and improving public education. Democrats plan to fund some of the new spending by increasing taxes on companies and wealthy individuals.
Tobacco companies and convenience stores oppose a tax increase on tobacco and vaping products that aims to raise about $9 billion over 10 years. Lobbyists for the oil industry are trying to block a tax change that would cost the industry billions by eliminating deductions they now receive for taxes paid overseas. Pharmaceutical firms are lobbying against a measure that could cost them $250 billion over a decade by lowering the costs of drugs purchased by Medicare.
Opposition to Mr. Biden's package is being led by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable.
Neil Bradley, the chamber's executive vice president and chief policy officer, acknowledged that some U.S. companies are sitting out this fight.
"Invariably, in any major piece of legislation, people make their own independent judgments, and it is not unusual for some of them to come to different conclusions," Mr. Bradley said.

Full text: GLASGOW -- After a week of climate talks here at the COP 26 summit, negotiators are grappling with a fundamental math problem: The commitments governments have collectively made to slash greenhouse gas emissions don't add up to what scientists think is needed to avoid the most destructive effects of global warming.
Addressing that shortcoming is one of the main tasks of the summit's second week. Negotiators from key governments, including the U.S. and the European Union, are no longer banking on a few developing countries to come up with deeper cuts during the summit itself, officials say. Instead, they plan to negotiate how to push governments to make new, more ambitious pledges in the near future.
Officials are discussing ways to encourage governments to revisit their emissions plans more frequently than every five years, a schedule set by the Paris climate accord of 2015. That, they hope, could create a mechanism to embolden countries to continue reducing emissions more quickly.
The challenge is that most governments, including all the world's major emitters, have recently updated their emissions plans, and are expecting to spend the next few years passing them into law. The Biden administration is waging domestic political battles to adopt its proposals. Other governments such as China have just submitted updated plans under the Paris accord after rebuffing pressure by the West to be more ambitious.
While scientists say all countries are affected by climate change, pressure to cut emissions more quickly is coming from poorer countries that are particularly vulnerable to its impacts, such as rising sea levels and drought. The Climate Vulnerable Forum, a coalition of developing countries that includes Bangladesh, Ethiopia and the Maldives, last week asked governments to re-examine their emissions plans every year.
They want to make sure the plans are in line with the Paris accord's goal: cutting emissions to levels scientists hope will limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial era temperatures by the end of the century.
The summit's first week delivered some important climate agreements, including pledges to stop deforestation and slash methane emissions. Dozens of countries said they would stop funding new coal-fired power plants, including some like Poland and Vietnam that rely heavily on coal to generate electricity.
India announced a long-awaited update to its climate-change plan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country is aiming to generate half of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 and achieve net-zero greenhouse gases by 2070, meaning its emissions would be low enough that they can be completely offset by natural and artificial means of absorbing them.
The International Energy Agency said that with India's new announcement, the world is on track for 1.8 degrees of warming by the end of the century, the first time the agency's analysis has put Earth's temperature trajectory below two degrees. But the IEA also cautioned that governments' plans don't outline enough emissions reductions by 2030 to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach.
Governments face a daunting timeline. At current emissions levels, warming above the 1.5-degree threshold will be inevitable in less than 12 years, according to the Global Carbon Project, a collective of scientists that provides climate data to the United Nations. The U.N. says annual carbon-dioxide emissions need to fall 45% by 2030 compared with 2010 to hit the target.
To bridge the gap quickly, Western officials say they are discussing the idea of a more frequent examination of Paris accord plans. That could also be paired with an annual assessment of the plans conducted by the U.N., they say.

Full text: The United Nations conference on climate change in Glasgow has been full of promises by companies to reduce their carbon emissions. How many will live up to them and how will anyone know if they are complying?
A sampling of new commitments includes United Airlines Holdings Inc., which says it will replace 5% of its jet fuel with biofuel alternatives by 2030, and more than 450 banks and other financial firms who say they are shifting their businesses toward clean energy. Dozens of other businesses talked up their climate plans.
Two-thirds of S&P 500 companies by the end of last year had set a carbon target, up from less than half at the end of 2017, and the tally is rising rapidly, according to data provider Refinitiv.
These targets have been hard to track, much less enforce. A survey of big companies published last month by Boston Consulting Group found that just 11% had met their emission-reduction goals over the past five years.
That is changing as regulators, investors and activists scrutinize corporate disclosures to make sure businesses aren't going back on their promises. Targets are becoming increasingly standard, and more businesses are aiming for them. That allows the commitments to be more easily verified.
The Securities and Exchange Commission may require companies to report progress against their goals under new climate rules it is drafting, officials have said.
Investors and activists are also ramping up their scrutiny of targets, putting pressure on high-emissions companies and their banks to set more demanding benchmarks.
Several initiatives at the past week's summit involved science-based targets -- ones in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on global warming that scientists say is needed to limit climate change.
Only around one in five S&P 500 companies have science-based targets, but this proportion will likely increase under pressure from investors, proxy advisers and regulators, Morgan Stanley analysts said last month.
The Science Based Targets initiative, which verifies this type of climate goal, also forces companies to meet their promises without climate gimmickry. The group doesn't allow companies to effectively reduce their carbon emissions by using offsets like paying for trees to be planted.
United joined a new alliance backing green tech called the First Movers Coalition. It was launched Thursday in Glasgow by U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and the World Economic Forum.
Airlines in the grouphave committed to replacing at least 5% of conventional jet fuel -- their biggest source of planet-warming emissions -- with biofuel alternatives by 2030. For United, that target is a stopover on its long-haul "100% green" ambition of having zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The 2050 target depends on the success of untested carbon-capture technologies, as well as sustainable fuels becoming commercially viable. It is also at odds with United's recent emissions history: The company's carbon footprint increased by 10%, from 38 million to 42 million tons, in the five years through 2019, its data show. A United spokeswoman said the airline holds 1 1/2 times the biofuels commitments of the rest of the world's airlines combined.
Kevin Moss of the World Resources Institute, one of the organizations behind the Science Based Targets initiative, said offsets such as funding forests were helpful for the climate, but not a substitute for cutting greenhouse gases.
"The science requires that emissions are reduced at [a certain] level," he said. "Most companies need to reduce by 90% to 95% by 2050."
ConocoPhillips was the first U.S. oil-and-gas company to commit to net-zero operational emissions by 2050, according to its website.
Shareholders this year said that wasn't good enough. They voted to require ConocoPhillips to also promise to reduce the greenhouse gases created by the use of its fuels by its customers, known as Scope 3 emissions.
That could have forced ConocoPhillips to produce less oil and gas. But the company said it isn't measuring its emissions by total carbon output. Instead it tracks the amount of carbon it emits to produce a given amount of oil or gas, known as its carbon intensity.
That made it easier for ConocoPhillips to sign a $9.5 billion deal to buy U.S. shale assets. It acknowledges the deal will increase its overall emissions, at least in the short term.
A ConocoPhillips spokesman said the newly acquired assets have some of the lowest greenhouse gas-intensity in the world. The deal is consistent with the company's strategy for meeting energy demand through the transition to a lower-carbon economy, he added.

Full text: GLASGOW -- Organizers of the COP26 United Nations climate summit welcomed one of their highest-profile critics Friday: Greta Thunberg.
Ms. Thunberg headlined an hourslong protest march and rally in Glasgow. Thousands of mostly young demonstrators marched from Kelvingrove Park to the city center. Organizers estimated the protest drew 25,000 people.
COP26 officials have called Friday the "Youth and Public Empowerment" day, clearing out much of the technical briefings and news conferences that have filled most of the summit so far. That has provided another global platform for Ms. Thunberg and a handful of other high-profile climate activists, who supporters say have used their youth and social-media savvy to help broaden support for action.
Ms. Thunberg shot to fame three years ago as a schoolgirl who cut classes to protest what she said was inaction on climate change. She moved on to bluntly dress down world leaders. More recently, she has taken aim at the U.N. climate summit process itself, accusing it of being a talking shop with few concrete accomplishments to show for itself.
On the eve of Friday's rally, Ms. Thunberg, now 18 years old, called the summit "a two week celebration of business as usual and blah blah blah" on Twitter.
"Blah, blah, blah is completely true, that is what world leaders do," said Amanda Randall, a 59-year-old artist who traveled from England to the protest march.
Many diplomats say they are making steady progress on many fronts in trying to reach deals that would lower global emissions to levels scientists hope will curb global warming. Critics say progress so far is incremental.
The U.K., the summit's host country, said it welcomes the dialogue with demonstrators.
"The U.K. is committed to hosting an inclusive COP. Ensuring that the voices of those most affected by climate change are heard is a priority," a spokeswoman for the event said.
While not part of any formal talks at the summit, Ms. Thunberg has sometimes stolen the show from world leaders, diplomats and technocrats.
Ahead of Friday's rally, she triggered an online debate about her increasingly salty language. She was asked on Twitter if she would commit to "net-zero" bad language, echoing climate-talk jargon for how countries account for their carbon emissions.
She answered with the sort of time frame most big countries have given for when they will get net carbon emissions to zero. The U.S. for example has promised to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 and reduce them by 50%-52% by 2030. Ms. Thunberg vowed to stop swearing "by 2052 with a 39, 78% reduction by 2034."
The evolution in her public persona continues to resonate with young activists who have energized the push for action on climate in recent years, according to Richard Black, a research fellow at the Grantham Institute, which studies climate change. Now "she is becoming more direct in the way she speaks," he said.
Daisy Earl, 19, came by train from Leeds. She says she is fed up by what she calls greenwashing. "It's all talk, no action, they keep making pledges but don't do anything," she said.
While Ms. Thunberg's status and influence have grown, she continues to operate largely independent of any official support infrastructure, according to people who have worked with her. She relies on a loose web of fellow activists, nongovernment agencies and scientists to help pro-bono to inform and organize her campaign.
The Fridays For Future movement she founded isn't a legal entity and depends on local volunteers to run their own campaigns in different countries. Ms. Thunberg sometimes gets logistical help from environmental groups. Members of the Global Strategic Communications Council, a network of communications professionals, help with media work.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The House passed a roughly $1 trillion public-works bill late Friday, sending to President Biden's desk a generational investment in roads, bridges and rail that had languished for several months.
Negotiated and approved by a bipartisan group of senators this summer, the bill reauthorizes existing federal infrastructure programs for five years and pours an additional $550 billion into water projects, expanding access to broadband internet and overhauling the electrical grid, among many other measures.
A major piece of Mr. Biden's economic agenda and his vision for making the U.S. more competitive internationally, its passage in the House hands him a bipartisan achievement that presidents of both parties have tried, and failed, to achieve for years. But the effort was circuitous and tortured for House Democrats, whose paper-thin majority repeatedly complicated leadership's plans for the legislation.
Democrats on Friday began planning to approve the infrastructure bill after passing the rest of the party's priorities in a separate, roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package. Progressive Democrats had demanded that the social-spending legislation first receive a vote in the House, hoping to ensure that centrists who support the public works bill would also vote for the broader education, healthcare and climate measures.
That design fell apart on Friday, though, as centrist Democrats demanded more time to analyze the cost of the social-spending bill, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) to change tack and bring up the infrastructure bill for a vote.
The sudden pivot surprised progressives, who initially signaled that they were prepared to vote against the public works bill if it came up on Friday. Mr. Biden lobbied the progressives to support the infrastructure bill and prodded the centrists to signal their public support for the education, healthcare and climate legislation.
A group of five centrists released a statement Friday night committing to supporting the social-spending bill after it received a full score from the Congressional Budget Office that was in line with White House estimates of its cost.
"We commit to voting for the Build Back Better Act, in its current form other than technical changes, as expeditiously as we receive fiscal information from the Congressional Budget Office -- but in no event later than the week of November 15th," the group said.
Mr. Biden also released a statement Friday night urging lawmakers to approve the infrastructure bill, assuring them that moderates would support the broader social-policy and climate bill. Democrats also scheduled an initial procedural vote on the broader social-spending measure for Friday night as part of the agreement.
"I am urging all members to vote for both the rule for consideration of the Build Back Better Act and final passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill tonight," Mr. Biden said, adding that was confident the House would pass the social-spending legislation during the week of Nov. 15.
The statements were ultimately enough to secure the votes of progressives, who met for hours Friday afternoon and evening to chart their next steps.
"We will deliver," said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.).
Mrs. Pelosi didn't waver in her bid to pass the infrastructure bill on Friday, promising that she could overcome the initial progressive opposition to the vote. She said the public-works measure would "create good-paying jobs across the country building the infrastructure of our country, with mass transit to help clear the air, with safer bridges for safety for the American people, for broadband to help people communicate better."
"They are very important, very important to the success of our economy," she added.
Democrats see both the infrastructure bill and the broader social-spending package as central to their efforts at fighting climate change.
The public works legislation puts $65 billion towards improving the electrical grid and energy production, $50 billion towards making infrastructure more resilient to cyberattacks and natural disasters and roughly $7.5 towards building additional charging stations for electric vehicles.
While they have applauded those measures, progressives have said they are insufficient without the tax subsidies and other measures in the social-spending bill as they pushed for a simultaneous vote on the broader bill.
But the small set of centrist Democrats stuck to their own demand that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office render an official estimate of the cost of the legislation before it comes to the House floor. CBO found this summer that the infrastructure bill -- financed by repurposing existing government funds, among other measures -- would contribute $256 billion to the deficit over a decade.
Such an analysis can take weeks, pushing back Democrats' timeline for approving legislation that is expected to also fund a universal prekindergarten program, expand healthcare subsidies and raise taxes on very high-income Americans and corporations, among other steps.
Once it passes the House, though, the social-spending bill would face changes in the Senate, where Democrats control a bare 50-50 majority. Republicans are expected to unanimously oppose it in both chambers.
"There is nothing here but partisan social spending. . . . . This bill will fundamentally change life in America for every citizen, and not in a good way," said Rep. Michael Burgess (R., Texas).
Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), a critical vote in the Senate, has opposed a paid-leave measure that House Democrats added to the bill this week and raised broader questions about its impact on the deficit and inflation.
The legislation's immigration measures could also change in the Senate. House Democrats have proposed shielding immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally from deportation for five years and provide a five-year, renewable work authorization as part of the bill. That measure could face problems in the Senate's rules.
The House's plan to raise the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction to $80,000 for nine years also faces possible revisions in the Senate due to opposition from some lawmakers.

Full text: GLASGOW -- Most of the world's developing countries have backed a demand for wealthy nations to channel at least $1.3 trillion in climate finance to them annually starting in 2030, the opening salvo in one of the most contentious negotiating topics at the COP26 climate summit.
African nations and a group called the Like-Minded Developing Countries, which includes China, India and Indonesia, said in a document they submitted to the United Nations at the summit that half the money should go toward funding renewable energy in the developing world and half toward protecting these countries from the effects of global warming.
Developed nations have long pledged to help pay for developing nations to respond to climate change. That promise was crucial to sealing the Paris accord in 2015, when the U.S., Europe and other wealthy countries agreed to provide $100 billion a year from 2020 through 2025.
The $1.3 trillion target for mobilizing funds reflects the huge investments that will be needed after that to reach the climate targets of the Paris accord, the paper says.
"The post 2025 mobilization goal must reflect the ambition, progression and the collective agreement to stay well below 2 (degrees) Celsius and aspire to stay within the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature goal," the paper says.
Developed nations didn't hit that target in 2020, falling $20 billion short, and aren't likely to meet it until 2023, climate negotiators said in a report in October. The shortfall has angered developing nations and complicated the talks in Glasgow.
Western officials say they aren't ready to set a target for climate finance post-2025, given how difficult it has been for them to hit the $100 billion target. They will only begin the talks at COP26 on a goal for post-2025.
Delegates from China, India and Africa didn't respond to requests to comment.
The European Union on Thursday said there had been a good start to climate negotiations in Glasgow. "It's a bit early to say whether we are on track for a fully successful COP but the early signs seem reasonably good," said Jacob Werksman, the EU's lead negotiator.
One of the top priorities for the meeting is finalizing the rulebook behind the 2015 Paris Agreement. Outstanding issues include defining rules for international carbon trading, whether countries should update their carbon emission reduction plans more frequently than the current five-year cycle, and rules on the reporting of those goals.
This week, some climate negotiators said they had made progress toward establishing a framework for international carbon trading, after Brazil said it was ready to make concessions, having blocked any agreement in the past.
Also on Thursday, two groups that include dozens of countries agreed to stop funding new coal-fired power plants and overseas oil and natural-gas projects.
The two agreements fit into a pattern of deals reached by subsets of like-minded countries pursuing their own, limited emissions-reducing ambitions at COP26, which they hope can pressure other countries to act more aggressively.
"These announcements are raising the bar for everyone, including India and China," said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at think tank Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.
The two deals come as a broader U.N.-backed agreement on specific, binding emissions-reductions commitments evades delegates so far. Big polluters like China, India and Russia have pledged emissions cuts, but not to the levels that Western nations, like the U.S., the U.K. and members of the EU have insisted are necessary to limit global warming.
Ending coal financing has been a key focus of the U.K. government in its role as host of the climate talks. Signatories to the coal deal have agreed to phase out unabated coal power -- meaning projects that don't have technology to capture carbon-dioxide emissions -- in major economies that have signed on in the 2030s, and for the rest in the 2040s. The U.K. government estimates the deal could result in the closure of 40 gigawatts of coal power, equivalent to over half the U.K.'s electricity-generating capacity.
But Thursday's deal falls significantly short of a global pledge. Leading coal consumers China, India and the U.S. aren't part of the 40-member group that signed the pledge. Meanwhile, a separate promise by the U.S. and the U.K. to end public funding of oil and gas investments overseas included about 20 signatories.
The largest funders of fossil-fuel development abroad, including South Korea, Japan and China, weren't part of Thursday's oil and gas agreement. Europe was split.

Full text: GLASGOW -- Climate negotiators have made progress toward a deal aimed at establishing the foundation of an international carbon-trading system, according to people familiar with those talks, putting within reach a long-stalled agreement that many businesses hope will kick-start a global carbon market.
Brazilian officials, who have made a series of demands blocking a deal in the past, say they are now ready to make big concessions. Chinese officials feel they have smoothed out any formal differences with Washington over the issue, a person familiar with the matter said. On Wednesday, China's climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, said he was hopeful countries could reach a carbon-trading deal during COP26, the United Nations climate summit taking place over the next two weeks here.
"There is an expectation among everyone that we advance on this" in Glasgow, Marcelo Donnini Freire, Brazil's deputy secretary for climate and international relations, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. "Brazil is going to take an extremely proactive and constructive position so that we can successfully advance."
A deal isn't imminent, people familiar with the talks say, and progress could unravel. The deal has been a longtime goal for climate negotiators, foundering at previous summits, including in Madrid in 2019.
It is still unclear how far Brazil is willing to go in concessions necessary for any agreement, these people say. A European Union negotiator said there are still differences needed to be worked out in the text of any deal, and negotiators aretrying to narrow them so ministers can strike an agreement during the second week of COP26 talks.
Still, Brazil's recent change of tone has some negotiators optimistic. "There is an increased willingness to move," said Espen Barth Eide, Norway's minister of climate and environment. "There's an interest in resolving this." Norway and Singapore are leading the carbon-trading talks.
Some governments have already introduced mandatory carbon markets for some industries, including in the EU, California and China. Companies have also started to use a hodgepodge of voluntary carbon markets, where they can trade so-called carbon-offset credits. Firms have rushed into those markets amid pressure from governments, investors and customers, but critics say they lack consistent standards and oversight.
Carbon-market proponents are looking to the U.N. to endorse a rulebook that would enable governments to transfer credits between each other under a globally recognized system. They are also seeking a framework for international carbon trading covering both government and private-sector activity.
Chief executives, including at energy giant Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Dove soap maker Unilever PLC, have urged governments to get a deal done. While companies don't participate in COP26 climate negotiations, many have made lobbying governments over the carbon-trading issue a priority for the summit.
"It offers companies a viable pathway to net zero," said Dirk Forrister, the International Emissions Trading Association's chief executive. Many companies, he said, will need to use carbon-offset credits to meet climate goals that regulators, investors and consumers are asking of them.
Generally speaking, carbon credits would accrue to countries or companies that finance emission-reduction projects. Countries that emit more carbon than theyagreed tounder U.N. commitmentscould buy credits to lower their net emissions,or invest in projects abroad to generate credits that can be used at home.
A U.N. deal would provide a way for big, established carbon markets like the EU's to link up with other markets. China, for instance, this year started rolling out its own domestic carbon-trading market.
Critics of a U.N.-backed framework say it could allow high emitting countries and companies to put off making deeper cuts in their own emissions, instead enabling them to transfer carbon credits among themselves.

Full text: President Biden returned home from the United Nations climate summit on Wednesday, having used the opening days of the conference in Glasgow to try to paint China and Russia as isolated holdouts to a global consensus over fighting climate change.
The president has staked his legacy at home and abroad in part on his ability to rally the international community to address climate change. But Washington and allies such as the U.K. and the European Union failed to get China, Russia and other big polluters to strengthen what the West sees as too-modest emissions-cutting commitments ahead of the summit, called COP26.
U.S. officials said they have been frustrated by China's unwillingness to offer up deeper cuts and Beijing's suggestion that climate talks be broadened to focus on other issues. That has emboldened Mr. Biden to criticize both rivals in recent days and signal the U.S. is unified with a majority of the rest of the world in addressing climate change, U.S. officials said.
U.S. officials don't expect Beijing or Moscow to move significantly during the next two weeks of talks, a senior administration official said. That, combined with the departure of heads of state from Glasgow, suggests odds -- already stacked against a breakthrough in Glasgow -- have grown even longer.
"You can't get anywhere without China, and China isn't doing anything much, infinitesimal movement," said Todd Stern, who was the U.S. special envoy for climate change under former President Barack Obama. "And their position would not be any different if the U.S. was sending them flowers."
Mr. Biden twice in three days directly criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, first for opposition to a stronger statement on climate change at the weekend's Group of 20 summit and on Tuesday for their absence in Glasgow. In Scotland, the U.S. launched several initiatives intended to show a contrast between its work and the reluctance of those rivals.
On Monday, it announced a long-term strategy with a goal to zero out greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050, 10 years earlier than Russia or China. On Tuesday, it officially launched a pledge with more than 100 other countries to cut methane emissions 30% by 2030. China and Russia weren't part of the deal. The U.S. also rejoined the High Ambition Coalition, primarily island states and Western allies that promote lofty goals to address climate change.
The negotiating team led by John Kerry, Mr. Biden's climate envoy, has continued to work diplomatically with Chinese and Russian officials.
Biden administration officials say they have sought to compartmentalize the U.S.-China relationship. They have insisted they won't grant policy concessions to Beijing on issues such as trade and human rights in exchange for progress on climate. As recently as September, Chinese officials brought up solar panel tariffs in climate talks, calling them unfair, Mr. Kerry said in a briefing to reporters that month at the end of his second visit to China as envoy. China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, said then that "cooperation on climate change cannot be divorced from the overall situation of China-U.S. relations."
Meanwhile, U.S. officials are seeking out agreements with other allies in Glasgow.
"With President Xi and Putin both skipping the COP, the administration has been pushing ahead with those on the ground and trying to maximize and celebrate progress where it's available in Glasgow," said Pete Ogden, a former top White House climate adviser during the Obama administration and currently vice president for energy, climate and the environment at the United Nations Foundation.
Chinese officials are skeptical that the U.S. will be able to deliver on its promises given its polarized domestic politics, and have criticized the West for repeatedly raising its goals while failing to meet the ones it has already set. Last year, Mr. Xi brought China's pledged date of peak emissions from "around" to "before" 2030 and said the country would reach net zero emissions before 2060, which its leaders say is realistic.
"Tackling climate change requires concrete action, not empty words. China's actions on climate change are real," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
Russia has also tied climate negotiations to wider issues. In an interview on Tuesday with the Russian state news agency, TASS, the Kremlin's special envoy to COP26, Ruslan Edelgeriyev, said his team had asked foreign colleagues bluntly about lifting Western sanctions to help speed up Russia's push to eliminate emissions.

"I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly," Mr. Biden said Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit. "The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, what value add are they providing? They've lost an ability to influence people around the world."
He said he felt the same way about Russia. "Literally, the tundra is burning," Mr. Biden said of Russian President Vladimir Putin. "He has serious climate problems and he is mum on his willingness to do anything."
Representatives for Russia and China's U.S. embassies didn't respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Biden's comments marked the second time in recent days that he had singled out Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr. Putin for not attending the conference. On Sunday, Mr. Biden blamed the two countries, along with Saudi Arabia, for standing in the way of a stronger statement on climate change at the recent summit in Rome of the Group of 20 major economies.
Climate is the latest point of friction between China and the U.S. as the two countries butt heads over trade, Taiwan and the navigation of the high seas.
Mr. Biden said he isn't worried about armed conflict with China, but expressed concerns that misunderstandings could raise tensions.
"I don't anticipate there will be a need for there to be physical conflict," he said. "But you know, you've heard me say this before, my dad had an expression. He'd say, 'The only conflict worse than one that's intended is one that's unintended.'"
Mr. Biden said he expects to speak virtually with Mr. Xi in the near future. "I want to make sure there's no misunderstanding: It's competition, not conflict," Mr. Biden said of the message he plans to deliver to the Chinese leader.
Mr. Xi isn't known to have left China since January 2020. He has kept his diplomacy virtual because of concerns about Covid-19. Mr. Putin also cited the pandemic as the reason why he didn't attend.
China, the world's No. 1 emitter of greenhouse gases, has committed to reach net-zero emissions before 2060. But its carbon emissions will continue to rise in the coming decade, peaking sometime before 2030 as it continues to burn coal. Western nations, including the U.S., have said China needs to do more.
Led by former Secretary of State John Kerry, Mr. Biden's climate envoy, the U.S. has held direct conversations with Chinese officials for months to persuade the country to do more to cut emissions. Mr. Kerry met with Chinese officials in London days before the Glasgow summit, officials said.

Full text: Most of the world's big banks, its major investors and insurers and its financial regulators have for the first time signed up to a coordinated pledge that will incorporate carbon emissions into their most fundamental decisions.
The lenders and investors say they will help fund a shift that will reduce carbon emissions by businesses and spur the growth of industries that can help limit climate change. Regulators are putting in place new rules to oversee the move.
The U.N.'s Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero says financial groups with assets of $130 trillion have committed to its program to cut emissions. That is enough scale to generate $100 trillion through 2050 to fund investments needed for new technologies and enough reach to impose pathways for corporations and financial institutions to restructure themselves, the group said.
The funding can take the form of bank loans and investments by venture capitalists, private-equity firms, mutual funds, endowments and other big investors that buy stocks and bonds. These all would be used to shift funds toward investments that help lower carbon emissions, while making a profit.
Financial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, plus the global-accounting-standards organization, have agreed to add their own oversight to the system through reviews and disclosure standards.
"We now have the essential plumbing in place to move climate change from the fringes to the forefront of finance so that every financial decision takes climate change into account," said Mark Carney, a former head of central banks in England and Canada who led the initiative for Glasgow.
Diplomats in Glasgow are wrangling over commitments by the world's governments to cut carbon emissions. That is putting the private sector ahead in addressing climate change. While the agreements announced this week are largely voluntary, they are more specific and transformative and include financial commitments that governments are reluctant to provide.
The promises represent a sharp turn in thinking at most global financial institutions. Six years ago, when world leaders gathered in Paris for a predecessor to Glasgow, financial institutions and banks weren't a serious part of the conversation.
At the start of 2020, the sum total of financial capital committed to hitting net-zero emissions was $5 trillion, compared with the $130 trillion this week.
To deliver, financial executives admit they would need more global government cohesion on regulations.
"It's going to be hard to achieve those commitments without governments in a meaningful way," said Joseph Amato, the president and chief investment officer at $400 billion investment manager Neuberger Berman, which is part of the Net-Zero group. "There's going to be a lot of local politics that are going to affect the pace."
The private-sector plans are far from concrete. That has led to questions about whether their pledges are real or will carry the weight the financial companies say they do.
Critics have questioned banks for refusing to cut off oil-and-gas producers faster, and focusing on net-reductions that allow for continued support for larger emitters.
Those in the Glasgow group -- which includes banks, insurers, investors, stock exchanges, ratings firms and index providers -- are pledging to set "science-based" targets to sharply lower emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050.
The U.N. group has limited power to enforce its rules, but regulators are moving in the same direction. A new international body is being created by the group that sets international accounting standards to develop standardized rules on how companies should disclose climate information.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to announce rules over carbon disclosure in the near future in line with plans in place in the U.K. and the European Union. Central banks from dozens of countries have said they are working on climate-related examinations of financial institutions to further pressure the industry into thinking about its risks.
The U.K. on Tuesday said it would set requirements for companies to publish net-zero transition plans, setting out how they will decarbonize through 2050.
The work isn't entirely altruistic. Massive amounts of money will be made by those who get the answers right. Critics say that by joining the group, banks can get undeserved credit for going green before they have done anything. They argue that banks that are big lenders to fossil-fuel companies should be forced to take action before they sign up.

Full text: GLASGOW -- World leaders from more than 100 countries, including the U.S., China and Brazil, agreed to a deal aimed at ending and then reversing deforestation by 2030, committing nearly $20 billion of public and private funds to protect and restore forests.
At the COP26 climate summit in Scotland on Tuesday, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the pledge a landmark agreement that includes countries accounting for 85% of the world's forest land. But details about how such a deal, which isn't legally binding, would be executed and policed haven't been worked out.
"Protecting our forests is not only the right course of action to tackle climate change but the right course for a prosperous future for us all," Mr. Johnson said.
The deal represented a bridge between the world's rich countries and poorer, developing ones. The two sides had squared off over a broader consensus over how quickly to cut emissions in an effort to stave off the worst effects of global warming.
The agreement is also a step forward from a similar pledge to save global forests made in 2014 at a summit in New York. That pledge, though, didn't include China, Brazil and Russia, which have now signed up. Getting those big, fast-growing nations aboard was vital for the process, officials said.
The funds will be used to help countries restore forests and tackle climate events, such as wildfires. They will also help indigenous people protect their land and improve data systems to track illegal logging. The signatories covered forest land stretching from Russia to the Amazon and Congo rainforests. Forests are key for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping curb global warming.
Some $12 billion of public finance for the project comes from 12 countries and will be made available between 2021 and 2025. The pledge leans heavily on the private sector. $7.2 billion of private investment in the project includes $2 billion from Amazon.com Inc.'s founder Jeff Bezos' Bezos Earth Fund.
In "too many parts of the world, nature is flipping from a carbon sink to a carbon source," Mr. Bezos said, while presenting the initiative.
Over 30 finance companies signed a pledge to not invest in commodity-driven deforestation. Signatories included big U.K. insurer Aviva PLC.
A G-20 meeting of the world's biggest economies over the weekend failed to narrow a divide between rich countries such as the U.S. and members of the European Union, which have asked heavier polluting countries, such as China and India, to accelerate their emissions cutting pledges.
The deforestation deal included both rich and poor countries, including nations such as Brazil and Indonesia, frequently the target of critics who said those governments aren't doing enough to protect their forests.
"We are committed to protecting these critical carbon sinks and our natural capital for future generations," Joko Widodo, Indonesia's president, said ahead of the Tuesday announcement.
Some expressed skepticism about the pledge, saying it would have to be properly implemented and enforced to have any real effect. "World leaders first set a 2030 goal to end deforestation in New York in 2014, but since then deforestation has accelerated across many countries," said Alison Hoare, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House think tank.
Still, the agreement was the first big win for the U.K. COP presidency, which aims to use the two-week event to push a series of side deals to curb emissions. These include reducing the use of coal, accelerating the move from combustion engine cars to electric cars, and finding more cash to give to developing nations to help them transition away from fossil fuels.

Carbon Tariffs Gain Momentum --- New proposals could reshape industries but also raise the risk of trade disputes

Full text: Governments in the U.S., Europe and other developed nations are embarking on a climate-change experiment: using tariffs on trade to cut carbon emissions. The idea has the potential to rewrite the rules of global commerce.
Policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic are looking at targeting steel, chemicals and cement. The tariffs would give a competitive advantage to manufacturers in countries where emissions are relatively low.
It's an idea that is gaining acceptance among U.S. businesses, particularly in those industries, as well as among politicians who see an opportunity to appeal to domestic manufacturers and their workers. Over the weekend, the Biden administration announced the first-ever trade agreement to incorporate such a concept. The pact with the European Union would jointly curb imports of steel that generate high levels of carbon emissions.
Carbon tariffs, also called border adjustments, are intended to plug a hole in domestic policies that discourage emissions. A country that imposes a carbon tax or some other regulation on a steel mill, for example, can raise that company's costs and prices, making them less competitive domestically.
Such a move could also encourage buyers to import less expensive steel, potentially produced with higher carbon emissions, or encourage manufacturers to shift production to countries with less regulation -- undoing the environmental benefits of the taxes and putting domestic companies at a disadvantage. Environmental economists call that leakage.
The risks of carbon tariffs are similar to those that come with regular trade barriers. A carbon tariff could push up production costs and prices, hurting businesses buying those products as well as consumers. They would hit the economies of developing countries that depend heavily on exports. And they could undermine world trade rules and trigger trade disputes. Some countries say the proposals are really protectionism in disguise.
An estimated one-quarter of global greenhouse gases are produced by goods that cross borders, according to a 2018 report by economic and environmental consulting firms KGM & Associates Pty. Ltd. and Global Efficiency Intelligence LLC. In effect, the report said, the emissions that many developed countries claim to have eliminated were "outsourced to developing countries," which generally have fewer resources to invest in cleaner and more advanced technology.
"America has an advantage from a lower carbon footprint," Jim Fitterling, chief executive of chemical giant Dow Inc., said. "We want to continue to expand that advantage and I believe a carbon border-adjustment mechanism will help."
Economists and policy makers have been exploring the idea of carbon tariffs over the past 20 years, to level the playing field for domestic companies and to encourage trading partners to toughen their own emissions rules. When Yale University economist William Nordhaus accepted the Nobel Prize for his work on the economics of climate change in 2018, he proposed a global "climate club" of low-polluting countries that would impose a 3% tariff on imports from higher-polluting non-club members.
The idea took on new life as nations looked to intensify their greenhouse-gas reduction plans ahead of the United Nations climate conference that opened Monday in Scotland.
The plan unveiled Saturday came as part of an effort to curb global overcapacity for steel and aluminum, which U.S. officials have attributed largely to China. Under the arrangement, governments can restrict imports of products made using methods that produce more carbon dioxide. The two sides didn't provide details on how and when to implement the plan, but said that they would develop it over the next two years. President Biden told reporters that the new agreement would help "restrict access to our markets for dirty steel from countries like China and counter countries that dump steel in our markets."
The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment.
Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top House Republican for trade policy, criticized the agreement as "enormously complex managed trade."
The European Union has taken the lead in carbon tariffs, unveiling its proposed plan in July. It currently has a cap-and-trade system in which domestic companies must obtain a permit to emit carbon, capped at a set amount. Permits currently change hands for around 60 euros, or $68, per metric ton of emissions.
Under its proposal, the EU would charge producers outside the area a fee similar to what domestic companies pay, based on the carbon content of their products sold in Europe. The border adjustments would initially apply to four heavily polluting sectors: steel, aluminum, cement and fertilizer. European officials hope to implement the program by 2025 as part of a broader deal to cut continental emissions 55% by 2030.
British, Japanese and Canadian governments have begun exploring similar plans. In the U.S., more than a dozen bills have been introduced in Congress since 2015, by both Democrats and Republicans, that include some kind of carbon tariff, usually linked to a carbon tax on domestic products.
"Other countries, Europe and Canada, are being very aggressive," said Rep. Scott Peters (D., Calif.), who introduced carbon tariff legislation in July. "What we don't want is for our companies to be at a competitive disadvantage."
A carbon tariff could quickly shift advantages across borders, including by significantly altering the global steel trade, the Boston Consulting Group wrote in a report about the EU's proposal last year. Chinese and Ukrainian steel made with high-polluting blast furnaces would lose market share to more efficient mills in Canada and South Korea, it said.
U.S. companies have invested heavily and taken advantage of technological improvements in recent years to reduce their carbon footprints, often driven by regulations.
The Climate Leadership Council, a business-backed group lobbying for economywide carbon pricing and border adjustments, said that products manufactured in the U.S. in major sectors such as metals, chemicals, electronics and vehicles generate 40% less carbon dioxide in their production than the global average.
It estimates that one of the largest beneficiaries of U.S. carbon tariffs would be the politically powerful steel industry. American steelmakers are more likely to use a more-efficient production method that recycles scrap metal, while many Asian producers rely on a different method that converts new iron into steel.
A carbon tariff of $43 a ton could reduce steel imports into the U.S. by half and completely eliminate purchases from the least carbon-efficient countries, including China, the Climate Leadership Council said.
Supporters say a carbon tariff could rewrite the politics of climate regulations, softening resistance from conservatives skeptical of the need and worried about the cost.
George David Banks, a veteran Republican environmental policy official who worked in the Trump White House and is now promoting carbon tariffs, said, "Once Republican voters recognize that this is the way of getting our supply chain back to the U.S., I think people are going to see the climate agenda very differently."
Carbon tariffs may also appeal to lawmakers as a way of blunting economic and security threats from China, the world's largest carbon emitter.
Among the groups that could find the idea less appealing are companies that end up paying more for carbon-intensive imports.
The Boston Consulting Group's report on the EU proposal estimates that European paper manufacturers, big importers of wood pulp, could see profits cut 65% on those imports. Importers of semi-manufactured gold -- used in jewelry, electronics, dentistry products and other goods -- could see profits fall by 10%.
Some trade experts warn that the reshuffling might not curb total global emissions. An industry trade group representing European aluminum makers said China could evade the EU's carbon tariff by exporting to Europe the 10% of its aluminum made with hydropower, while keeping metals made with coal in Asia. Russian aluminum maker Rusal PLC has announced plans to create a new low-energy subsidiary aimed at European sales, while focusing the rest of its factories for domestic demand.
Carbon tariffs are "a perfect tool in economic theory, but we are not living in an economic theoretical world, unfortunately," said Markus Zimmer, an environmental economist for Allianz SE in Germany. "Once all the politicians and the lawyers work through the regulations, you can get the opposite of what you intend."
Carbon tariffs can be a potential channel for protectionism, with governments designing them to benefit domestic industries rather than to simply level the playing field. World trade rules allow border adjustments that are intended to impose the same costs on foreign as domestic manufacturers, rather than to block import competition.
"It will be hard to avoid accusations of green protectionism, given how the starting point clearly is concern about low-cost foreign production," Michael Mehling, deputy director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the U.S.-EU steel trade agreement.
The risk is exacerbated by the lack of international consensus on quantifying the carbon embedded in goods, and whether to include the full carbon footprint, from the mining of raw material to transporting the product to final users.
Governments have submitted data on the average carbon intensity of basic products like steel and cement as part of the 190-nation Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gases. They didn't include data for individual manufacturers, so a low-carbon producer could be hit with a tariff calibrated to a higher national average.
Counting and verifying emissions at individual facilities will be difficult, and could create the potential for manipulation, said Stefan Koester, a senior analyst specializing in climate policy at Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.
Nearly every version of a carbon tariff designed by academics or lawmakers is twinned with some type of domestic carbon price. That makes it easier to make the case to trading partners that the purpose is to create a level playing field, so that producers all over the world pay the same fee.
In the U.S., carbon pricing -- whether a carbon tax or a European-style emissions-trading scheme -- remains deeply unpopular. Congressional Democrats are looking at ways to calculate "implicit costs that come from regulation" of U.S. companies and imposing an equivalent cost on foreign competitors, said Mr. Peters, the California congressman. "It's not a simple thing."
For nations, attempts to balance green pledges with a free-trade agenda haven't had much success. The World Trade Organization has repeatedly declared illegal member environmental policies, such as subsidizing domestic renewable energy production, saying those improperly discriminate against foreign competitors.
"The WTO is considered by many as an institution that not only has no solutions to offer on environmental concerns, but is part of the problem," Mr. Biden's trade representative, Katherine Tai, said in April.
"The WTO is only as decisive as its members," said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, who stressed that the group can only make a decision with a consensus among its 164 members.
In a meeting of the WTO's market access committee in November last year, officials from 19 countries raised concerns about the EU's plans for its carbon border-adjustment plan, according to meeting minutes. Russia's representative criticized "protectionist objectives," noting that the EU intends to use the tariff as a new source of budget for powering its economic recovery after the pandemic.
"Tackling climate change should . . . not become an excuse for geopolitics, attacking other countries or trade barriers," Chinese leader Xi Jinping said of Europe's tariff plans in an April call with then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, according to Chinese state media.
The WTO's legal system is crippled by a stalemate between the U.S. and other countries over the proper mission and power of its trade courts. That heightens the risk that carbon tariffs will trigger retaliation by countries imposing their own countermeasures.
"Either they find a way to deal with it collectively," said Alan Wolff, who recently retired as WTO deputy director general, "or there's going to be the world's largest trade conflict over this issue."

Full text: Global leaders at the Glasgow climate summit pledged Tuesday to sharply curtail methane emissions, with President Biden saying the U.S. would tighten regulations on oil and natural-gas production to reduce leaks of the potent greenhouse gas.
The effort spotlighted growing concerns about the environmental harms of methane, a byproduct of drilling, livestock and landfills that traps about 85 times as much heat as carbon dioxide.
"One of the most important things we can do in this decisive decade . . . is to reduce our methane emissions as quickly as possible," Mr. Biden said at a summit event marking progress on the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative led by the U.S. and the European Union to cut methane emissions by 30% globally by 2030.
More than 100 countries have signed the pledge. Summit participants including the U.S., China and Brazil also committed Tuesday to ending and then reversing deforestation by 2030, promising nearly $20 billion of public and private funds to protect and restore forests.
Under the newly proposed U.S. methane regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency would seek for the first time to regulate methane at existing oil and gas wells nationwide, a move smaller producers fought for years. About a million new and existing wells would be under the stricter requirements.
EPA Administrator Michael Regan called the methane reduction plan "a very bold and aggressive step towards tackling climate pollution."
"The timing is critical here," he said in a phone interview. "World leaders are gathering in Glasgow, and they're looking to the United States for leadership."
The rules would mandate what the EPA calls "a comprehensive monitoring program to require companies to find and fix leaks" across operations including wells, pipes and storage tanks. The agency's plan includes provisions to encourage the use of new technology such as drones for more effective monitoring.
It would also prohibit venting off gas at oil wells, which producers sometimes do when oil is much more valuable than gas. The EPA would require producers to put that gas in a pipeline to be sold when possible to keep natural gas from being wasted. In 2030 alone, that would save $690 million worth of gas that might otherwise be wasted, the agency said.
The combined measures would reduce methane emissions from oil wells, storage tanks and other facilities covered by the regulations by an estimated 74% by 2030, compared with emissions from those sources in 2005, the EPA said. The agency said it aims to complete the regulations next year, following a 60-day public comment period and a review by other agencies that could lead to changes.
Complying with the new rules would cost the oil-and-gas industry an estimated $1.5 billion by 2026, the year it is fully implemented, the EPA said, an estimate that includes capital expenses and operating and maintenance costs, minus projected revenue from gas that would otherwise not be captured.
By 2032, those costs would decline to about $1 billion, the EPA said. The EPA said the benefits would outweigh the costs by reducing harmful health effects from methane and property damage from severe weather linked to global warming.
The rules face pushback from some Republican lawmakers who said consumers could end up footing the bill.
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.) said Tuesday that her staff would review the rules to ensure they "are justified and cost-effective, especially with the cost of gasoline and natural gas already surging this year."
"These costs on families hit home and they are not sustainable. It should be a top concern of President Biden who is instead in Europe promoting his agenda to shut down American energy," said Ms. McMorris Rodgers, who sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, in a joint statement with Reps. David McKinley (R., W.Va.) and Fred Upton (R., Mich.).
The rules have been a flashpoint within the industry, often pitting global oil giants against smaller domestic rivals.
Big oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP PLC have supported more federal regulation in recent years, under pressure from investors concerned about climate change.
The American Petroleum Institute, the oil-and-gas industry's dominant trade group, said Tuesday that it supports expanding regulations to include older wells and facilities but that it is still reviewing specifics.
"We will continue working with the agency to help shape a final rule that is effective, feasible and designed to encourage further innovation," said Frank Macchiarola, the group's senior vice president for policy, economics and regulatory affairs.
A smaller industry trade group, the Independent Petroleum Association of America, previously raised concerns about the plan, saying rules that effectively require advanced technologies like optical leak-detection systems would be too costly and complicated for low-production oil and gas wells.
The group said Tuesday that it was reviewing the proposed rule but was "encouraged by its initial analysis of EPA's proposed regulations -- the agency has tried to be responsive to our concerns for improved cost-effective monitoring technology and recognizing the importance of addressing small business challenges."
Mr. Regan said technology is advancing so quickly that even some smaller producers would likely be able to comply without financial harm. He said the agency should proceed with the rules because of the broad threats climate change poses for society, citing extreme weather events and disasters.
"The cost of inaction is far more severe and pressing," he said. "We believe that when you look at cost, you have to look at costs across the board."
The tougher measures have broad support from environmental groups, though some say the proposal contains loopholes that could let methane escape from operations.
Lauren Pagel, policy director at the environmental group Earthworks, said the rules would allow wells that emit less than three tons of methane a year to skip leak monitoring and detection if they pass a one-time inspection, potentially leaving the well unwatched if equipment breaks after that point.
"If no one is looking, you're never going to find the equipment that malfunctions," she said. "We know even the best equipment fails. All wells need detection."
About 30% of U.S. methane emissions come from the oil-and-gas industry, according to a White House estimate. The EPA's proposed rules don't affect methane emissions from agricultural livestock, such as dairy cattle and pigs, which contribute an estimated one-third of all methane emissions. Senior administration officials said the Agriculture Department would look to address that problem through other means, such as creating incentives for to farmers to capture emissions.

Full text: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday will propose a broad expansion and strengthening of rules to limit methane emissions from oil and natural gas production, in what President Biden has deemed a critical initiative to limit one of the most potent greenhouse gases.
The EPA said it would for the first time propose controlling methane at existing wells nationwide, a move smaller producers have fought for years. It would put roughly one million new and existing wells under EPA methane regulation, with more stringent requirements for new wells in addition to the first-time regulations for old ones.
The rules would require what the EPA calls "a comprehensive monitoring program to require companies to find and fix leaks" applying across operations, including wells, pipes and storage tanks. It includes provisions to encourage the use of new technology such as drones for more effective monitoring.
It would prohibit venting off gas at oil wells, which producers sometimes do when oil is much more valuable than gas.

The combined measures would reduce methane emissions from oil wells, storage tanks and other facilities covered by the regulations by an estimated 74% by 2030 compared with emissions from those sources in 2005, the EPA said.
The announcement comes during the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow, where Mr. Biden is seeking to assert U.S. leadership on global warming, in the wake of former President Donald Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement.
"There is no doubt that this proposal is taking a very bold and aggressive step towards tackling climate pollution," EPA Administrator Michael Regan said. "The timing is critical here . . . world leaders are gathering in Glasgow and they're looking to the United States for leadership."

Full text: GLASGOW -- President Biden told world leaders at the COP26 summit here that the coming decade would be decisive in the fight against climate change.
Hours later, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a slower than expected deadline for slashing his country's emissions, saying India would take as long as 2070 to reduce its net greenhouse gases to zero.
The gap highlights a fundamental divide between developing and developed nations, days after leaders of the Group of 20 major economies made little progress hammering out specific climate goals many had hoped would ease discussions in Scotland.
Speaking to leaders and government officials from most of the world's nations, Mr. Biden warned that "none of us can escape the worst that is yet to come if we fail to seize this moment." But he said there is still time to improve the trajectory.
Developed and developing nations are arguing over which countries should shoulder more of the burden for further emissions reductions, with the goal of keeping the climate targets of the 2015 Paris accord within reach. That deal committed countries to cutting emissions to levels scientists hope would limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, and close in on 1.5 degrees Celsius, over pre-industrial era temperature.
A key point in the debate is how quickly to achieve net-zero greenhouse gases, meaning emissions have been slashed so low that they can be completely offset by natural and artificial means of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The U.S. and Europe have pledged to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. The G-20 economies, including India, agreed on Sunday on the "key relevance" of reaching net-zero emissions by or around midcentury.
U.K. officials, who are hosting the summit, said India's timeline was disappointing and not consistent with hitting the targets of the Paris accord. China's climate plan targets net-zero before 2060, which Western officials say is also too late.
Some international climate officials and environmentalists were encouraged by other aspects of India's pledges -- including a 2030 target for renewable energy capacity.
Disappointment among industrialized countries over India's ambitions come as negotiators from developing countries worry about the U.S. commitment to fighting climate change over the long term. The U.S. has twice backed out of U.N. climate-change deals -- first the Kyoto Protocol under President George W. Bush and then the Paris agreement of 2015 under President Donald Trump.
After signing the U.S. back up to the Paris deal, Mr. Biden is struggling to pass his own climate plans through Congress.
President Biden in a keynote speech here sought to address those concerns.
"We'll demonstrate to the world that the United States is not only back at the table, but will hopefully lead by the power of our example," Mr. Biden said to delegates in Glasgow. "I know it hasn't been the case, and that's why my administration has been working overtime to show that our climate commitment is action, not words."
The president said the U.S. would make a series of announcements during the summit centered on oil and gas, agriculture and deforestation.
The White House released a report on Monday laying out a long-term strategy for meeting the president's goal of reducing U.S. emissions in half by 2030 and to net zero by 2050.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as Mr. Biden flew from Italy to Scotland, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said there had been progress at the G-20 but cited China as a "significant outlier."
"The U.S. is stepping up to do its part," Mr. Sullivan said. "Key U.S. allies: Japan, Korea, the European Union, Canada, others are stepping up to do their part. And now the question is, 'Will some of the remaining countries step up to do theirs?'"
In his written speech delivered to COP26 on Monday, China's president, Xi Jinping, rebuffed criticism that his country wasn't promising enough. He said governments should make realistic environmental pledges.
The U.N. says governments' current emissions-reduction plans put the world on track for 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming, and that some of the biggest economies, including the U.S., haven't put in place the policies needed to meet their targets.
Developing countries argue that developed nations -- in particular the U.S. -- are responsible for most of the carbon-dioxide emissions, which accumulate in the atmosphere and cause warming over decades. They want the U.S., Europe, Japan and a few other nations to cut their emissions faster.

Full text: ROME -- The world's leading economies made no major progress on Sunday over how to cut greenhouse gas emissions, showing how difficult it will be to achieve a breakthrough at United Nations climate talks in Glasgow over the next two weeks.
During a two-day summit in Rome, leaders of the Group of 20 major economies, which includes the U.S., India and China, struggled to find a consensus on how best to adhere to the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The agreement aims to achieve net zero emissions by midcentury, meaning that enough greenhouse gases are removed from the atmosphere to match any new emissions.
Leaders agreed to stop financing new coal-fired power plants overseas but otherwise hammered out few specifics on how to limit a rise in global temperatures or a timeline for doing so.
The G-20 economies account for around 75% of global emissions. Their summit in Rome comes ahead of U.N. climate negotiations known as COP26 in Glasgow that began Sunday evening and last for two weeks.
"I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled -- but at least they are not buried," U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday.
President Biden in his closing news conference touted the G-20's efforts to address climate change but singled out Russia, China and Saudi Arabia as standing in the way of a stronger statement on the issue.
"I think you're going to see we made significant progress and more has to be done, but it's going to require us to continue to focus on what China's not doing, what Russia's not doing and what Saudi Arabia is not doing," Mr. Biden said.
The standoff leaves the world's biggest economies with a daunting task going into the negotiations. They must come to an agreement over how developed and developing nations are going to divide the burden of limiting emissions to achieve the climate targets of the Paris accord.
The U.S. and Europe are pushing China, India and other big developing economies to commit to earlier reductions. Developing countries counter that wealthy nations should do more and are demanding a big increase in financial support from the developed world.
The G-20 includes some of the world's biggest polluters and fossil-fuel producers, and countries with disparate levels of development, making consensus difficult. The Rome summit's final communique included no new commitments to phase out coal use domestically or fossil-fuel subsidies. The U.K. government, which is hosting COP26, has said it wants to use the U.N. summit to "consign coal to history."
G-20 leaders agreed to halt public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, albeit only plants that aren't outfitted with technology to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions. The G-20 nations also for the first time pledged "to reduce G-20 methane emissions significantly," the communique said.
"These commitments, as welcome as they are, are drops in a rapidly warming ocean," said U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose government is hosting the COP26 conference in Scotland. "We have had a reasonable G-20 but there is a huge way yet to go."
The G-20 communique reaffirmed leading economies' commitment to the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to limit the rise in average world temperatures to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial levels. For the first time, the G-20 said the 1.5 degrees target should be kept within reach and that member countries would commit to taking further action this decade. They provided little detail on how they wanted to achieve this goal. The U.N. said the world's current emissions-reduction policies would allow 2.7 degrees of warming.
The G-20 summit couldn't agree on a deadline for reaching net zero emissions. Mr. Guterres has previously called carbon neutrality by 2050 "the world's most urgent mission."
China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is aiming for net zero before 2060. India and Russia haven't committed to the midcentury deadline. The G-20 communique said members would strive to achieve carbon neutrality "by or around mid century." A previous draft version of the communique had set a deadline at 2050.
"If Glasgow decides the same thing as G-20, it will be a failure," said Li Shuo, a Beijing-based policy analyst for Greenpeace.
Stoking tensions among the G-20, rich nations have so far failed to meet a pledge to grant $100 billion a year to developing countries to help finance their shift away from fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change. Currently, that $100 billion target will be met in 2023, rather than by 2020 as pledged, U.K. authorities recently said.
Mr. Johnson said the key element in unblocking the climate negotiations in Glasgow would be money. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India had urged G-20 leaders to give 1% of gross domestic product to developing nations to ease their transition away from fossil fuels, according to Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson said that "was unlikely in the short term," but said he hoped to see more private investors at COP26 commit to helping poorer nations with the transition.
While leaders such as departing Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said the final communique was "a good signal for Glasgow," others such as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada expressed disappointment that the statement wasn't more ambitious.
"There's no question that Canada and along with a number of other countries would have liked stronger language and stronger commitments on the fight against climate change," Mr. Trudeau said. He added he would have liked to have seen a firmer commitment to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and stronger language about moving off coal at a faster pace.
Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy, who led the G-20 summit, deemed the meeting a success. "Until today, we didn't share ambitions; today we share all objectives and all ambitions. Now we need to share the speed of action," he said.
President Xi Jinping of China told the G-20 summit on Sunday in a video address that developed countries should fulfill their promises on providing climate finance to developing countries.
Meanwhile, the U.S. and the European Union reached a deal to ease U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that were imposed under the Trump administration. G-20 leaders also gave their seal of approval to an agreement to set a minimum global corporate tax rate.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Democrats in Washington and Virginia are growing anxious as the neck-and-neck Virginia governor race looms Tuesday without a resolution to the negotiations over President Biden's spending plans.
Democrats on Sunday sought to move beyond disappointment over the state of Mr. Biden's social-spending plan, from which several popular provisions, such as one lowering prescription drug prices, have been discarded amid a long and messy intraparty debate. Party leaders cast the investments as historic and said the public would rally around them once they become law, an acknowledgment of the toll the debate has had.
Mr. Biden, who left for a key trip to Europe without a House vote on the roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill or a final deal on a broader package of social-spending and climate measures, was confronted Sunday with new polling. NBC News released a survey showing Mr. Biden's national approval rating at 42%, down 7 percentage points since August.
Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, who is running against Republican Glenn Youngkin, sought to play down those concerns despite having banked on passage of the infrastructure bill to lift his prospects with voters on Tuesday. "When I travel around Virginia, they're not asking about what's going on in Washington," he said on NBC.
It is increasingly unlikely the infrastructure bill will be approved before Election Day as negotiations continued over the weekend on the larger spending plan, which includes programs to address child and elder care, education and climate change. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), an influential progressive, said Sunday the House shouldn't vote on infrastructure until Democratic senators have agreed to the contents of the larger bill, which currently amounts to about $1.85 trillion.
Speaking at a news conference in Rome after the G-20 meeting of leaders of the world's major economies, Mr. Biden expressed confidence that the social-spending package Democrats are considering, which would include $555 billion in climate-related provisions meant to encourage a shift to low-carbon energy sources, will be approved by Congress.
"It's gonna pass, in my view. But we'll see," he said.
Two key centrist senators hadn't explicitly endorsed the package as of Sunday and Mr. Sanders and others said they would continue to try to add items, which could complicate the timeline. "We're working today. We're going to work tomorrow to strengthen that bill," Mr. Sanders said on Sunday.
Top Democrats are hoping to move both pieces of legislation through the House this week.
Should Mr. Youngkin prevail in a state where voters favored Mr. Biden over former President Donald Trump by 10 percentage points in last November's election, it could rattle vulnerable congressional Democrats up for re-election next year. Mr. Youngkin, a businessman and private-equity investor who has kept a distance from the former president, is focusing heavily on schooling issues, playing up parental rights over curriculum and school mask and vaccination mandates.
"We're going to get a majority back, and part of it is exactly what's happened with Glenn Youngkin's race," Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said on Fox News.
Mr. McAuliffe's candidacy is testing Democratic enthusiasm as Mr. Biden's approval ratings have sunk to the low-40% range in Virginia, several polls show, with the president being so far unable to steer his proposals through a Congress that his party controls with narrow margins.
On a national level, the NBC poll showed Democrats trailing Republicans on questions of who better handles the economy and immigration and sliding on issues such as education and the Covid-19 pandemic. Much of that slide has come from within the Democratic base, suggesting a damping of enthusiasm among the party's voters headed into Tuesday's election.
Other polls show Democratic voters -- both moderates and progressives -- have largely rallied around the push to increase government spending and say they worry lawmakers will fail to come to an agreement. Democrats have very narrow control of Congress, and the party can't afford a single defection in the 50-50 Senate.

EXCHANGE --- Who Pays for Climate Change? --- An ex-central banker is leaning on big banks to commit to the U.N.'s green protocols. It can be a tough sell.

Full text: Diplomats heading to the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow next week know their governments can raise only a fraction of the trillions needed to cut carbon emissions and transition the energy market to renewables. They asked Mark Carney to come up with the rest.
Mr. Carney, the former head of central banks in Canada and the U.K., beseeched, cajoled and browbeat the world's top financiers to pay the bill. When that failed, powerful allies flexed their muscles.
"The world is watching," he said in an interview. "I am going to be judged. Everyone is going to be judged."
Can he pull it off? The answer will help determine one of the biggest open questions of the coming decades: Who pays for climate change? There is a general agreement among businesses, investors and the U.S. government that the country should become carbon neutral in the coming 30 years while limiting the climate costs already incurred. The challenge, however, is figuring out how to split the price of making that happen.
Mr. Carney's appeal to the global finance community is a crucial piece of the puzzle. Analysts say as much as $150 trillion is likely needed over the next three decades to fund renewable energy projects, upgrade electric grids, mothball fossil-fuel plants, seed new agricultural technologies, and pay for damages tied to climate change.
The Glasgow summit, the successor to the Paris conference that produced the 2015 climate accords, offers another forum to wrestle with these issues. This time, nations are under pressure to lay out clear plans to cut carbon emissions this decade and become carbon neutral by 2050. The aim is to limit global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels, and preferably 1.5 degrees, thresholds above which many climate scientists warn of catastrophic and irreversible harm.
As the U.N.'s point man on climate-change finance, Mr. Carney had some early successes. He got commitments last spring from Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. to shift their money to businesses that reduce global carbon emissions. Big insurers and asset managers, too, signed on in large numbers.
The rest of Wall Street was a tougher sell. He encountered resistance at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where Mr. Carney spent 13 years. The major Canadian banks dragged their feet, too, another awkward setback for Mr. Carney, a native son who harbors political ambitions in the country. Most big banks from China, India, Japan and Australia haven't joined.
What he wanted the banks to do specifically was agree to steps outlined in a 14-page protocol written by the environmental arm of the United Nations. That would mean setting targets for less lending and investment in enterprises that produce carbon emissions; devoting more support to new, environmentally sustainable technologies; and publishing their progress on these targets each year. Banks would be under pressure to either push clients away from carbon emissions or drop those that don't comply.
Some of the biggest concerns from the banks were potential legal risks, the feasibility of measuring their total exposure to carbon emissions and how annual progress reports could be received by shareholders. Banks were particularly worried about getting lending and investment portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier. If a bank failed to reach net zero, would shareholders sue? Bank chief executives also fretted that climate promises might harm their successors if targets weren't met.
Supporters of Mr. Carney, such as the White House and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, put the screws to fellow financiers in ways that some found irritating. Large shareholders that belonged to his alliance prodded holdout banks. During the U.N. General Assembly meeting in late September, Mr. Carney walked through gridlocked traffic to lobby Goldman's CEO, David Solomon -- a stark reversal of roles from the days when Mr. Carney, the central banker, set the rules and Wall Street obeyed.
He appealed to their vanity. Banks that didn't commit by Oct. 15 wouldn't have their logos on Glasgow press materials. Their executives would miss out on prime speaking slots at the conference, Mr. Carney's staff warned.
One of Mr. Carney's biggest challenges would be convincing JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, boss of the largest bank in the U.S. by assets. Mr. Dimon privately criticized Mr. Carney's effort as overly vague, people familiar with the matter said. He also worried that it would conflict with potential new regulations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, these people said.
Mr. Carney, 56, is the product of a remote town in Canada's Northwest Territories called Fort Smith, where the average January high is 0 degrees Fahrenheit and the motto inscribed on the town flag is "perseverance." His parents -- who moved to Edmonton, Alberta, while he was still young -- were teachers and volunteers in local community, church and school programs. He said they encouraged him to "give and serve."
Mr. Carney did well enough in school to attend Harvard University, where he studied economics and economic history and paid for schooling with a grant and student loans. He later got a master's degree and Ph.D. from the University of Oxford, in economics.
He joined Goldman because, he said, his brother had worked there and "I had an enormous sum of money in student loans" that needed to be paid off. It also allowed him to see the world; he helped countries such as South Africa, Japan and Russia dig their way out of economic crises in the 1990s. The work helped him understand, he said, the impact one could have in government and influenced his decision to leave so he could help set monetary policy and regulate banks. He was governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and then governor of the Bank of England for seven years.
During his stay at the Bank of England he usually ran twice a week to his office -- roughly 9 kilometers from his West Hampstead home -- and did so without any security or bodyguards. "It was the best way to be on the streets and not get recognized," he said. "Surprisingly therapeutic."
He said he still jogs twice a week along the Ottawa River with friends who have been running with him for about 20 years. Except for winter months, his run ends with a plunge in a pond near his home in Rockcliffe Park, an affluent Ottawa neighborhood with heritage homes, foreign embassies and private schools. He said he also goes to Catholic church at least once a week, meditates and is a fan of Benedictine monk Laurence Freeman, the director of the World Community of Christian Meditation. His taste in music ranges from Nick Cave to Taylor Swift, whom he saw in concert while in the U.K.
Mr. Carney became increasingly critical of the financial industry in recent years. This spring he published a book titled "Value(s): Building a Better World for All" that he wrote during the pandemic. In it Mr. Carney, who experienced the aftershocks of the 2008-09 financial crisis in Canada and England, said he "worked to heal the malignant culture at the heart of financial capitalism."
His climate work began with what he assumed would be a short assignment. After leaving the Bank of England in 2020, he took on what he thought was a six-month job as U.N. special envoy on climate action and finance, a way to burnish his credentials with a private sector he hoped to re-enter. That six-month gig is now going on two years.
He launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero this spring. That set him off on a global recruiting effort to get financial companies to agree to set meaningful targets for reducing loans and investments to businesses that, directly or indirectly, are big emitters of greenhouse gases.
The campaign offered a new set of challenges for banks. Many had already backed away from the dirtiest investments, such as directly financing coal-fired power plants or new mines in ecologically sensitive spots. But the guidelines set by the U.N.'s environment arm would require that financial institutions first set public targets for shifting clients away from carbon emissions and then calculate the emissions produced by any investment long after the check was written -- a task made more complicated by the range of industries banks typically support.
A bond of bundled car loans, for example, would have to measure the gas burned by those vehicles. A letter of credit guaranteeing safe passage of an oil tanker would have to account for the carbon released when that crude is refined. It is not yet known how this tracking will work exactly and whether it might raise costs for banks or borrowers.
After an initial wave of bank sign-ups in the spring, Mr. Carney's recruiting campaign stalled. By early September, 28 of the world's largest 50 banks by assets had not joined, leaving just a month to deliver on his mandate before diplomats descended on Glasgow.
He tried to act like the regulator he once was, scolding banks in an August tweet: "If you're not part of the solution, you are the problem." He appealed to their greed, calling the fight against climate change "the biggest commercial opportunity in the world."
Neither strategy worked. His campaign struck many executives at holdout firms as both arrogant and toothless, likely to mire their firms in paperwork for decades and expose them to potential lawsuits from shareholders claiming they weren't doing enough. Similar blowback surfaced recently after banks signed a pledge not to fund oil drilling in the Arctic. Some investors and environmentalists say that pledge contains loopholes, and money has continued to flow from big banks to companies active in areas of Norway, Russia, Canada and Alaska rich in oil and gas.
Maggie Peloso, a climate lawyer advising several banks belonging to the alliance, said banks had legitimate reasons to be wary of agreeing to Mr. Carney's global agenda because local regulations are simultaneously shifting in countries where these institutions operate. "It's like trying to build the plane while you are flying it," she said.
Some resented being chided by one of their own. Evan Siddall, a former colleague at Goldman Sachs and the Bank of Canada, said Mr. Carney can get testy when people don't live up to his expectations. "He has a hubris and impatience that limits his ability to manage people," said Mr. Siddall, now the CEO of Alberta Investment Management Corp., a pension and government fund manager.
Mr. Carney said that while he is "not perfect" as a manager, he holds people to high standards in public service or in a crisis such as climate change because "there is very little margin for error."
Another move that attracted scrutiny was a more lucrative job Mr. Carney started last year. In August 2020, he became a vice chairman at Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which specializes in real-estate, infrastructure and renewable power investments. He now oversees investments designed to help with the transition to clean energy and runs a $7 billion fund chasing "positive social and environmental outcomes."
His dual role, as both green investor and an architect of a new global climate finance regime, has opened him up to questions about potential conflict of interest. In his U.N. role, he is pushing banks and investors to stop funding fossil-fuel producers and the like. At Brookfield, he's investing in companies that will benefit from a decline in those industries. Mr. Carney said the criticism of his job at Brookfield "doesn't make sense" because the company is a founding member of his alliance and has made the same commitment to reducing investments linked to carbon emissions.
He's also been criticized by some environmental groups for making it too easy for financial firms to appear eco-friendly while doing little of substance. "If there's one advantage of being a central-bank governor for 14 years," Mr. Carney said, "it's that you get used to being criticized on both sides."
As the Glasgow conference got closer, Mr. Carney increased pressure on the recalcitrant banks.
He and his political and industry allies pushed their big shareholders, who are under pressure from their own clients to use their financial firepower to combat climate change. Some major investors -- including Fidelity Investments and Canada's two largest pension funds -- have in recent weeks pressed some holdouts to the U.N. effort about either joining Mr. Carney's alliance or doing more to fight carbon emissions, people familiar with the matter said.
He turned to government officials to twist arms. U.S. banks that hadn't signed on to the U.N. alliance weren't invited to President Biden's climate summit this spring, people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Carney's pressure started to pay off. In September, the U.K. prime minister came to New York and pressed Wall Street executives to do more on climate change. Mr. Carney also has a role as the prime minister's finance adviser for the climate conference. Mr. Johnson, as the host of the Glasgow conference, has tried to become the most environmentally conscious leader of a major economy.
A turning point came at a breakfast hosted by Mr. Johnson at a British diplomat's luxury Manhattan condo. As the event broke up, Daniel Pinto, a top executive at JPMorgan, pulled Mr. Carney aside. The bank -- named the world's largest lender to fossil-fuel companies in a report this year from several environmental advocacy groups -- was a high-profile holdout to the U.N. alliance even though it had already announced a pledge to align with the Paris climate agreement and work toward global net-zero emissions by 2050.
The bank's position was becoming harder to defend in the face of growing pressure from shareholders and governments. Investors had waged a vote-out campaign in 2020 against a longtime JPMorgan board member, former Exxon Mobil Corp. chief Lee Raymond, who stepped down at the end of that year. And months of internal work had convinced JPMorgan executives that Mr. Carney's goals were both achievable and profitable. The bank was in, Mr. Pinto told Mr. Carney.
A JPMorgan spokesman said Mr. Dimon supports Mr. Carney's alliance "and what it is aiming to achieve."
The five big Canadian banks -- major sources of fossil-fuel financing, given that country's rich energy reserves and expertise in drilling -- signed up next, along with Wells Fargo. Goldman Sachs was last in among the big U.S. banks. As of Friday, 34 of the world's biggest 50 banks had joined Mr. Carney's alliance.
Giant banks from China and India, two of the world's biggest carbon emitters, haven't signed up, and neither have most big banks from Japan and Australia. The Glasgow conference starts Monday and Mr. Carney said he is campaigning to the end.
"We have this massive problem, we have left it very late," Mr. Carney said.

Full text: ROME -- Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies are split over phasing out coal and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, officials said, throwing into doubt whether ambitious climate-change targets can be hit.
The gathering of world leaders in Rome this weekend is expected to set the tone for talks at the nearly two-week United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, slated to follow immediately afterward.
G-20 nations, including the U.S., China, Russia, India and Saudi Arabia, will attempt to forge a common position on how best to adhere to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which asks countries to start reducing their emissions as soon as possible and achieve a climate-neutral world by midcentury.
Officials said forging consensus on policies to achieve this remains difficult given the G-20's competing interests and that few concrete proposals are likely to come out of the summit.
Recent energy crises have also spurred leaders to rethink their stance on fossil fuels. In China, a coal supply shortage has led to major revisions of the country's carbon road map, elevating the importance of energy security and creating wiggle room for adding more coal plants, a person familiar with the discussions said.
Without a positive signal from G-20 leaders, agreement at COP26 -- as the Glasgow climate summit is known -- will be even harder to achieve, climate activists fear.
The G-20 and COP26 could be "mutually reinforcing or mutually weakening," said one senior official involved in the talks.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi told Italy's Parliament this month that his country, which holds the G-20 presidency this year, hoped to achieve consensus among the group's leaders before the Glasgow conference.
"The climate crisis can only be managed if all major global players decide to act in an incisive, coordinated and simultaneous manner." Mr. Draghi said, noting that G-20 members account for about three-quarters of the world's carbon emissions.
The issue of coal will be a litmus test of G-20 leaders' political resolve. The group includes several heavy users and producers of the fossil fuel, including China, the U.S. and Australia. In July, G-20 environment ministers meeting in Naples couldn't agree to set dates for phasing out the use of coal and ending the building of new coal-fired power stations.
Coal-rich countries such as China, India and Australia emerged as vocal opponents of such targets, said people familiar with the talks, adding that Turkey, Russia and Saudi Arabia were also part of the camp.
Some countries fear that an agreement to phase out coal would quickly lead to pressure to wind down the use of other fossil fuels such as gas or oil, said Chris Littlecott, an associate director at climate consulting firm E3G.
A surge in fossil-fuel prices as economies reopened after lockdowns has led several countries, including China and the U.K., to lean on coal to power their industries and electricity supply.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said in April that China would begin "phasing down" its coal consumption in 2026. But neither China nor India, the second-most populous country in the world, is willing to commit to an end date or use the phrase "phase out" in relation to coal.
The action plan on how China plans to reach its carbon-dioxide peak before 2030, which was released by the State Council on Tuesday, said new constructions of coal plants needed to adhere to international energy efficiency standards. An earlier version of the plan made no mention of new coal-fired power plants, said the person familiar with the discussions, adding that a few renewable-energy targets had also been dropped from the final version, while a greater emphasis was placed on energy security.
Coal powers around 56% of China's industry-heavy economy and is regarded as vital for the country's energy security. It is unlikely China will even start considering this politically sensitive question until after the twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress in fall 2022, the person said.
China released its updated climate targets on Thursday, reiterating numbers said last year by Mr. Xi. China stuck to a pledge to start reducing its carbon emissions "before 2030," despite international pressure to begin earlier, and said it would achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.
China has signaled it is potentially more open to committing to ending overseas financing for coal use. "If they were to move on one issue, that would be the most likely," said Mr. Littlecott.
Mr. Xi said China would stop building overseas coal projects at the U.N. General Assembly in September. China had been the main holdout during the G-20 talks on the issue this summer, people said.
Developing countries such as China and India have said that it is more important to focus on implementing existing pledges first and providing financial support for poorer countries in their fight against climate change.
The G-20 summit will be the first in-person gathering of the leaders of the world's richest nations since the Covid-19 pandemic started, including President Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At least four G-20 leaders aren't expected to travel to Rome, including Mr. Xi and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Mr. Xi is expected to participate via a video link.

Oil Giants Strike Gusher Of Cash as Demand Rises

Full text: Big oil companies are generating their strongest cash flows in years and heeding investor calls to return it to shareholders instead of using it to drill.
The two largest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., reported on Friday their most profitable quarterly earnings since before the onset of the global pandemic.
Exxon reported earnings of $6.8 billion, its best quarterly performance since 2017, and said it would launch a $10 billion share buyback program starting next year. Chevron reported $6 billion in net income, its best quarter since 2013, and said it generated $6.7 billion in free cash flow, its most ever.
The industry is reaping the rewards of resurgent commodity prices -- U.S. crude has topped $80 a barrel this month for the first time since 2014 -- as the economy emerges from the stagnation brought on by Covid-19 and the shutdowns used to fight it. Global energy demand is rebounding faster than anticipated, and world-wide oil production, while still rising, is struggling to catch up with the surge in consumption.
Investors and analysts are watching closely to see if the oil industry will succumb to the temptation of plowing more money into growing production amid higher oil prices and increased demand, shrugging off austerity measures implemented during the pandemic.
After years of dismal returns, investors have sought pledges from producers that they will moderate growth and focus on shareholder payouts.
Some investors want companies to diversify and pivot to renewable energy as many countries transition to cleaner power sources because of concerns about climate change.
So far, most companies are sticking to smaller budgets and pledging to return more cash to shareholders.
Exxon raised its quarterly dividend on Wednesday by 1 cent, its first such increase since 2019, and said Friday it generated $12 billion in cash from operations.
Chevron said Friday that its year-to-date capital spending is down 22% and it paid dividends of $2.6 billion, reduced debt by $5.6 billion, and repurchased $625 million of shares during the quarter.
"Free cash flow more than covered the dividend and $4 billion of additional debt reduction," said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. "With the progress made in restoring the strength of our balance sheet, this week we announced a dividend increase maintaining 39 consecutive years of annual dividend growth."
Shares of Chevron rose 1.2% Friday, while Exxon shares were nearly flat at Friday's market close.
European energy companies are also raking in cash but say they will continue to use more of it to fund renewable-energy projects and investor payouts than growing oil and gas production.
TotalEnergies SE reported $4.6 billion in profit Thursday and said that strong cash generation from fossil fuels is enabling it to invest in growing its renewable-energy and electricity businesses. Royal Dutch Shell PLC, which is facing calls by activist investor Third Point LLC to split into two companies, reported a loss of $447 million Thursday, after writing off $5.2 billion linked to commodity derivatives. But the Anglo-Dutch giant said it produced $16 billion in free cash flow, its most ever, and would distribute $7 billion to shareholders from the $9.5 billion sale of its shale assets in the Permian Basin to ConocoPhillips in September. BP PLC reports earnings next week.
Though oil prices are up around 60% on the year, 50 of the largest oil companies have increased their annual budgets by only 1%, according to Raymond James. The companies initially budgeted $271 billion and that has only ticked up to $275 billion, the financial firm said in a note to investors.
Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of Adams Funds, said that in past oil-price surges Western oil companies have ramped up drilling, outspending their cash flows in pursuit of higher valuations to the detriment of returns. But even before the pandemic, investors began fleeing the sector and conveying to oil executives and boards that the only way to entice them back was to moderate growth and offer fat payouts, according to Mr. Stoeckle. The current price cycle is the first test of that capital discipline.
While most producers appear to be abiding by investors' wishes for now, questions linger for some about how they will spend their money beyond that. Unlike their European peers, U.S. oil companies are largely not diversifying into renewable energy.
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth has repeatedly said that Chevron won't invest in wind or solar power generation because he doesn't think it can make a larger return in those businesses. Instead, Chevron will return cash to investors and "let them plant trees" if they choose to, he said in a television interview in September.
Both Chevron and Exxon created low-carbon business units this year that will primarily focus onbiofuels, hydrogen production, carbon capture and other technologies. Chevron tripled its planned investment in its unit in September, saying it would spend $10 billion through 2028. Exxon increased its low-carbon spending Friday, saying it would invest $15 billion on such projects from 2022 through 2027.
But the increased green investment still represents a fraction of what the companies are spending on oil and gas projects, and it is unclear how profitable the units will be for the foreseeable future. Many of the technologies they are investing in will need further government subsidies to be economically viable.
Not everyone thinks tighter budgets are a good thing. During a contentious congressional hearing Thursday, some Republican lawmakers urged Messrs. Wirth and Woods and executives from Shell and BP to increase their oil production to alleviate high prices. Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform convened the hearing after accusing the oil industry of waging a campaign to spread disinformation about fossil fuels' role in causing global warming.
Exxon has said it would keep production roughly flat. On Friday, it said quarterly production increased 4% from the same period last year.
Chevron is increasing production, modestly. Pierre Breber, its chief financial officer, said in an interview that the company's production was up 7% in the quarter compared with the same period last year and will increase 3% annually through 2025. But he said Chevron is unlikely to commission any mega-oil projects that take years to come online and years more to pay out. Instead it is planning to drill more shale wells in the U.S., which produce quickly but decline rapidly.
"This is a sector that is working hard to attract investors," Mr. Breber said. "We really believe the winning combination for investors is the traditional business that's high return, low growth, low carbon combined with faster growing new energy businesses."

Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform accused the oil industry of waging a yearslong campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming and lobbying against policies central to President Biden's $1.85 trillion social-policy and climate framework.
All four companies said that they have long acknowledged the threat of climate change and are cutting their carbon emissions to minimize their contributions to it.
"At Chevron, we have been very clear where we stand," Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said. "We accept the scientific consensus: Climate change is real, and the use of fossil fuels contributes to it."
Democrats on the House committee said the companies publicly support climate-friendly policies and investments but privately work to derail regulations that would cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), chairman of the Subcommittee on the Environment, said that the American Petroleum Institute -- the industry's main lobbying group, which is funded by the companies -- is currently lobbying against Democrat-supported policies that he said would reduce emissions, including subsidies for electric vehicles and a methane tax.
"You're funding these groups, and they're really having an impact," Mr. Khanna told the executives. "Could you tell them to knock it off for the sake of the planet?"
API president Mike Sommers responded to allegations the group was lobbying against Democrat-backed climate change policies by saying the group supports market adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy, but not through government subsidies. He said renewable energy will be unable to replace fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.
"One area where experts agree is that oil and natural gas will continue to be the leading energy sources for decades to come, and it's important that we take action to reduce emissions while providing that energy," Mr. Sommers said.
The wide-ranging framework for social-spending legislation detailed by Mr. Biden includes expanded tax credits for electric vehicles, but a methane tax was dropped after opposition from some lawmakers. The executives said they didn't always agree with every policy position taken by the industry's trade groups.
At the end of the roughly six-hour hearing, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D., N.Y.), the committee's chairwoman, said she would subpoena the companies to compel documents requested by Democrats that she said the companies hadn't provided.
Republican committee members, at times, came to the companies' defense and used the hearing as an opportunity to criticize Biden administration policies they said are causing soaring energy prices. Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) said the companies should increase their production to alleviate energy shortages.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden's wide-ranging framework for social-spending legislation includes about $555 billion for climate-related provisions, a proposal that the White House said will help the U.S. meet its pledge to halve domestic greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of the decade.
Democrats haven't formally signed off on the framework, and lawmakers expect that it could change as they hammer out the details of the measure. It nonetheless gave Mr. Biden something to tout at the international climate summit in Glasgow that begins on Sunday.
The president and his senior aides have been working behind the scenes for weeks to nail down a package of climate measures ahead of the summit, eager to show skeptical world leaders that the U.S. is serious about meeting its commitments to slash emissions. Mr. Biden has pledged to cut U.S. emissions 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030.
"This framework makes the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis that has ever, ever happened -- beyond any other advanced nation in the world," Mr. Biden said in a speech at the White House on Thursday.
The climate provisions in the legislation alone likely wouldn't be enough to meet the target, according to outside analysts. White House officials are planning a series of climate regulations to help achieve the remaining reductions, including methane rules for oil and gas production and more stringent emissions limits on vehicles.
During a closed-door meeting with House Democrats on Thursday, Mr. Biden said the legislation was a test of the U.S. political system.
"The rest of the world wonders whether we can function," he said, according to a person familiar with his remarks.
Later in the meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said, "When the president gets off that plane we want him to have a vote of confidence from this Congress," according to the person.
The White House said the $555 billion for climate-related provisions is the largest such investment in history.
The climate measures include:
-- $320 billion in 10-year expanded tax credits for utility- and residential-scale renewable energy development, improved electric transmission and storage, electric vehicles and clean energy manufacturing;
-- $105 billion to boost resilience to the effects of climate change, such as wildfires and droughts;
-- $110 billion to grow U.S. supply chains for renewable energy technology;
-- $20 billion to motivate the government to purchase cutting-edge energy technologies.
The package also sets aside an unspecified amount of money for a Civilian Climate Corps, with the aim of hiring 300,000 workers for projects such as planting trees and cleaning streams.
The agreement doesn't include a $150 billion program opposed by Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) aimed at pushing utilities to generate more electricity from clean sources. Lawmakers said at least some of the money from that program -- which one outside analysis said would have helped Mr. Biden meet up to one-third of his emissions-reduction goal -- had been redeployed to achieve greenhouse-gas reductions through alternative means.
The White House didn't detail all of the climate provisions and Democrats were waiting to hear whether the framework also includes fossil fuel-related measures meant to appease Mr. Manchin.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Progressive lawmakers again flexed their muscles on Democrats' agenda, blocking party leaders' planned vote on infrastructure even as they endorsed President Biden's new framework for a sprawling social-spending and climate plan.
Liberal lawmakers have held up the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package for months as leverage to ensure a separate, now-$1.85 trillion social-spending and climate package also advanced. On Thursday, neither a new White House framework laying out details of the spending plan nor a pitch from Mr. Biden himself could persuade them to back a quick vote on the stalled public-works bill.
"We intend to vote for both bills when the Build Back Better Act is ready," said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, using the Democrats' preferred name for their social-spending and climate package.
The caucus formally endorsed the framework, which includes funding for child-care subsidies, universal prekindergarten, tax breaks for families, in-home care for elderly and disabled Americans, as well as tax credits aimed at combating climate change. But members worried the bill wasn't set in stone and expressed unease over where Democratic senators stood, leading them to reject calls from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) for a quick vote.
Roughly 30 members of the caucus are committed to opposing the infrastructure bill until there is a clear agreement on the social and climate bill, according to aides. Those lawmakers want a commitment that all 50 Democratic senators in the evenly split chamber support the framework, and they want the House to vote on the two bills together.
Rep. Juan Vargas (D., Calif.) left a meeting of the progressive caucus saying he's a "no" until he has more guarantees on the social-spending package. "I don't trust what the senators are going to do," he said.
Passing the infrastructure package, which includes about $550 billion in new spending, would show momentum for Mr. Biden's agenda.
Progressives said they were concerned that Mr. Biden's framework failed to gain a robust endorsement from Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, two centrists who have fought to trim the overall cost of the bill as well as cut many programs sought by progressives.
Both Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema praised the progress in the talks, but neither offered an explicit endorsement of the framework. Democrats are advancing the social-spending and climate plan through the Senate using a process called reconciliation, which enables the party to pass the bill with just a simple majority in the face of united GOP opposition.
"I think everyone is very clear that the biggest problem we have here is Manchin and Sinema," said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D., Ariz.). "They don't trust them, we need to hear from them that they're actually in agreement with the president's framework."
Thursday's tensions marked the latest turn in the tug of war between the party's centrist and progressive wings to advance the two packages. While the infrastructure bill waits for a vote, Democrats have struggled to put together an outline on the parallel bill, with complex negotiations on the price tag and tax plans making for slow progress.
Centrist Democrats and others who had pushed to pass the infrastructure bill worried that by blocking the vote, the progressives had put the bill at risk of never passing, and may have put the fragile House majority at risk by denying Congress a bipartisan victory.
"I am hopeful that, ultimately, common sense will prevail and a small faction of the party will join the broader effort to help pass President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, get shovels in the ground, and people to work," said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D., N.J.).
Democrats can afford to lose only three votes in the closely divided House, meaning progressives can easily sink a bill if they remain opposed. While some House Republicans have indicated they could support the bill, which drew the support of 19 GOP senators, they likely would withhold their votes until Democrats had enough votes to pass it on their own.
Mrs. Pelosi, who previously called off a promised vote on infrastructure in the face of progressive opposition, tried to rally House Democrats in their morning meeting with Mr. Biden, telling lawmakers that "in order for us to have success, we must succeed today." She also tried to respond to demands from members for legislative text, posting a version of the bill and encouraging members to read its more than 2,400 pages.
"For those who said 'I want to see text,' the text is there," she said, "for you to review, for you to complain about."
But as progressives remained unmoved, the party on Thursday again put off a vote, instead opting for a short-term extension of highway funding.
Progressives say they have already had to sacrifice some priorities they originally sought, such as free community college and 12 weeks of paid family leave, as the social-spending plan's price tag was winnowed from $3.5 trillion. They also wanted to give Medicare broad powers to negotiate on drug prices and expand the program to cover vision, dental and hearing coverage.
Asked about progressives' concerns on Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mr. Biden was working to get both packages passed, but would leave the sequence or timing to Congress. She also questioned whether any Democrats would vote against the infrastructure bill.

Full text: President Biden will push allies to do more to confront climate change and seek progress on a global minimum tax during a foreign trip that follows a bumpy stretch on the world stage and a late sprint to advance his agenda at home.
Following a celebratory trip overseas in June aimed at strengthening U.S. alliances, Mr. Biden's five-day tour to Italy and Scotland will include efforts to ease recent tensions. His administration is coping with frustration over the U.S. exit from Afghanistan and a diplomatic dust-up with France after it was cut out of a deal to supply nuclear submarines to Australia.
In the weeks leading up to the Group of 20 nations meeting in Rome and the Glasgow climate summit, Mr. Biden has worked to win agreement with congressional Democrats on a social-policy and climate bill and a separate infrastructure package. The administration also hopes to show it can still meet goals to cut emissions, despite setbacks in Congress.
Mr. Biden's priorities for the trip include working with allies on climate change, energy prices, supply-chain issues and a new global minimum tax.
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan played down any tensions, saying the U.S. and Europe are "aligned and united on the major elements of the global agenda." Mr. Sullivan said the president would make gains abroad even if the fate of much of his domestic agenda remained unresolved, saying the other leaders understand the process takes time.
The leaders of China and Russia aren't expected at either gathering. Mr. Biden's foreign policy has focused on countering the economic rise of China.
Mr. Biden first heads to Italy, where the second Roman Catholic president is set to go to Vatican City for an audience Friday with Pope Francis. They are expected to discuss issues including climate, Covid-19 and poverty. The visit comes amid controversy among U.S. bishops over Mr. Biden's support for abortion rights.
Also on Friday, Mr. Biden will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron. France was furious at being cut out of the Australia deal.
Unknown are what steps France now seeks from the Biden administration. At a minimum, Mr. Macron wants backing from the U.S. for his vision of strategic autonomy, in which the European Union would build out its own defense capability and rely less on support from the U.S. Mr. Macron's idea is controversial in Europe, and the U.S. historically has been skeptical of Europe developing a defense capability independent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Mr. Biden will meet with other leaders during both summits. Mr. Sullivan said he expects a meeting between Mr. Biden and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who this week backed off a threat to expel the U.S. ambassador and the top envoys of nine other Western countries who called for the release of a jailed philanthropist. In recent years, American-Turkish relations have cratered over clashing interests over the war in Syria, human-rights issues within Turkey and Ankara's purchases of Russian arms systems.
Mr. Sullivan said Mr. Biden also would attend a meeting of allies on how to bring Iran back into compliance with the nuclear accord.
At the G-20, an important issue for the U.S. is an agreement among nearly 140 countries to overhaul global tax rules, which is expected to receive backing from leaders.
The reform sets out a global minimum corporate tax of 15%, targeted at preventing companies from exploiting low-tax jurisdictions. The Biden administration has pushed for the move, arguing that the floor set by the global minimum tax was a victory for the U.S. and its ability to raise money from companies.
Mr. Biden is to attend the climate summit in Glasgow on Monday and Tuesday, and is expected to give an address while there.
The president is hoping to stress that the U.S. is serious about climate-change efforts, even if he is struggling to pass his agenda in Congress.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Pushing to reach a deal after months of talks, the White House released a $1.85 trillion social-spending and climate framework for a still-developing proposal, but it fell short of convincing progressives to quickly approve a parallel infrastructure bill.
President Biden met with House Democrats in the morning to pitch them on the new framework, a far slimmer piece of legislation than the $3.5 trillion the party had originally outlined. Democrats have been rushing to complete negotiations on the bill so that they can also move forward with the public works legislation, which passed the Senate over the summer but has languished in the House.
Party leaders initially signaled they wanted to hold a vote on the infrastructure bill later Thursday, but abandoned that plan in the evening in the face of progressive opposition, instead approving a short-term patch for transportation programs that were expiring at the end of the month. Progressives endorsed Mr. Biden's framework but said they still needed to see more detail of the social-policy and climate bill before they could support the infrastructure legislation.
The developments frustrated Democrats' hopes for a high-profile policy win as Mr. Biden headed to Europe. The White House released the framework just hours before the president boarded Air Force One for Rome, where he is set to meet with Group of 20 leaders before he attends the Glasgow, Scotland, climate summit. The White House is eager to notch wins on two central pillars of the president's agenda to firm up his sagging poll numbers and bolster Democrats' case with voters, with a test coming next week in gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey.
In a televised midday speech, Mr. Biden said: "No one got everything they wanted, including me, but that's what compromise is."
The White House framework released Thursday called for major funding for child-care subsidies, universal prekindergarten, tax breaks for families, in-home care for elderly and disabled people, as well as tax credits aimed at combating climate change. Several party priorities were absent, including a national paid leave program, while the fate of others, including a push to allow the government to negotiate drug prices, remained uncertain.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) had pressed for an immediate vote on the infrastructure bill following the release of the framework, even as many progressive lawmakers indicated they weren't ready to support it. A person familiar with the vote counting said there were about 30 progressives who still wanted Democrats to provide more clarity on the social-policy and climate bill before moving forward with a vote on the infrastructure bill. Vice President Kamala Harris was calling some lawmakers to try to persuade them to back the measure.
Wrangling all factions of the party behind a particular set of ideas has proven challenging, especially as congressional leaders and the administration have jettisoned some of progressives' favored proposals in the face of objections from moderates.
Mr. Biden headed to Italy on Thursday to begin a series of international meetings, and Mrs. Pelosi told Democrats during the morning meeting that they should pass the infrastructure slice of Mr. Biden's agenda by the time he lands.
"The president has asked for our vote today," Mrs. Pelosi told Democrats, according to the person familiar with the meeting.
But progressives, who for months have blocked the infrastructure bill as leverage to keep the social-spending bill on track, made clear they weren't yet ready to drop their opposition. Their demand forced Democrats to delay a vote on the public works bill for the second time in two months, though progressives said they hoped to move the bills in the House next week.
"There are too many no votes for the [infrastructure] to pass today," said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.), the chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
Progressives said they needed more certainty about the social-spending bill's contents and its fate in the Senate. But Ms. Jayapal said progressives would back off their insistence that the Senate pass the social bill before the House could move on infrastructure.
"We're going to trust the president on the Senate vote," Ms. Jayapal said. "But we do need the text and we do need the votes on both bills in the House at the same time."
House Democrats released a text of the social-policy and climate legislation, beginning the process for formally considering it, though Mrs. Pelosi acknowledged she would likely amend it. "There's some clarifications that will come forth because it's always moving a bit," she said.
Many of the changes Democrats have made to the bill have been the product of negotiations with two key holdouts in the Senate: Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.).
Neither Mr. Manchin nor Ms. Sinema explicitly endorsed the new framework.
"This is all in the hands of the House right now, this is. I have worked in good faith and I look forward to continuing working in good faith," Mr. Manchin said. Ms. Sinema said in a statement that Democrats had "made significant progress on the proposed budget reconciliation package."
Those statements did little to ease the concerns of House Democrats who worry about the pair further paring back the framework or ultimately opposing it entirely. "It's about the substance, and basically it's trust of Manchin and Sinema, that's the problem," said Rep. Steve Cohen (D., Tenn.).
The infrastructure bill, which showers funding on highways, rail and water systems, would reauthorize a series of transportation programs that are set to expire Sunday. The reauthorization legislation, which the Senate quickly adopted, will extend the programs through Dec. 3, when Congress will face several other major deadlines on government funding and the debt limit.
Democrats have been honing their mammoth spending legislation for weeks, seeking to both slim the package as well as find revenue to pay for new programs.
The plan includes a one-year extension of the expanded child tax credit through 2022, plus a provision making that break permanently available to low-income families that don't pay income taxes. It funds six years of universal prekindergarten, six years of child-care subsidies, and $150 billion to support long-term care for elderly and disabled Americans.
The framework also sets aside $555 billion for climate-related provisions, including $320 billion in 10-year expanded tax credits for renewable energy, transmission, electric vehicles and clean energy manufacturing.
A central challenge in the talks has been crafting ways to raise revenue for the package after Ms. Sinema objected to many of the tax increases.
A new surtax in the White House framework will be 5% on adjusted gross income above $10 million and a further 3% on adjusted gross income over $25 million, senior administration officials said. Those levies would hit high-income people but wouldn't address billionaires who are seeing their wealth increase without reporting much taxable income.
The plan will also include a 15% minimum tax on profitable corporations, higher taxes on U.S. companies' foreign income and money to increase the Internal Revenue Service enforcement staff. A 1% excise tax on corporate stock buybacks is part of the plan.
The tax plans do focus on high-income households and corporations, but other revenue-raising ideas proposed by the administration appear to lack enough support for now. Those include a tax on billionaires' unrealized capital gains, a rule requiring banks to report account flows to the IRS and higher corporate tax rates. Democrats said they would continue to seek changes.
The framework didn't include a popular provision to allow Medicare to negotiate with drugmakers to lower the cost of prescription drugs, which a senior White House official said reflected Mr. Biden's assessment of what could pass Congress. But lawmakers said the proposal could still make it into the final bill.

Full text: Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC has taken a large stake in Royal Dutch Shell PLC and is urging the oil giant to separate into two companies to retain and attract investors as many flee stocks seen as environmentally unfriendly.
The activist is the latest to pressure a major oil company to change its strategic direction, as the firms face calls to reduce fossil-fuel investments and pivot to renewable energy amid concerns about climate change. Upstart hedge fund Engine No. 1 waged a successful campaign to win seats on the board of Exxon Mobil Corp. in May.
Third Point's stake is worth well over $500 million, making the hedge fund one of Shell's largest investors, people familiar with the matter said.
In a letter to its investors Wednesday that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal, the activist said Shell should consider creating two stand-alone companies: one with legacy businesses such as refining that would provide steady cash flow and another that houses renewables and other units requiring substantial investment. It reasons that doing so would clarify the company's strategy and appeal to different sets of investors who have been making competing demands of the Anglo-Dutch company.
Among the major oil companies, Shell has been faster-moving than peers such as Exxon when it comes to remaking its business and reducing emissions. It isn't clear whether Shell will be receptive to the idea of separating into two companies. Third Point said in the letter the two sides have been in early discussions.
Shell has a market value of nearly $200 billion, according to S&P Capital IQ. Third Point, which says in the letter that Shell is trading at a discount to its peers despite having a better collection of businesses, estimates that a new company including Shell's liquefied natural gas, renewables and marketing businesses could have the same enterprise value as the company in its current form.
Shell said Wednesday that it "regularly reviews and evaluates the company's strategy" and that it welcomes open dialogue with all shareholders, including Third Point. Shell also said its strategy had been endorsed by the majority of its shareholders in a vote earlier this year. Shell is set to report its third-quarter earnings Thursday.
The role of climate change in investment decisions has taken center stage this year, as many institutional investors pare holdings in pollution-heavy industries and activists urge companies to remake themselves faster.
In May, a Dutch court ruled that Shell must cut its emissions by 45% by 2030. Shell has said it plans to appeal the decision.
Earlier this year, the company laid out plans to accelerate its shift to low-carbon energy by reducing its oil production and investing more in areas including biofuels and electric-vehicle-charging infrastructure. Shell agreed to sell its assets in the Permian Basin to ConocoPhillips in September for $9.5 billion.
The pivot to low-carbon energy is seen as challenging because it requires investment in areas in which oil companies don't necessarily have competitive advantages and with potentially lower returns.
Shell's new strategy has failed to excite investors who have said the uncertainties around the energy transition make it difficult to predict future profits. Though Shell stock has risen more than 30% this year, it is little changed over the past two decades. The shares rose nearly 2% after the Journal reported on Third Point's stake.
Analysts said shareholders could be receptive to splitting the company.
"Investors have generally pushed back against the hybrid model and are looking for ways to see these companies crystallize value" by carving out lower-carbon businesses, said Christyan Malek, an analyst at JP Morgan.
Some European oil companies are already considering splitting out their lower-carbon operations to offer investors more focus, including Italy's Eni SpA and Spain's Repsol SA.
Others in the industry, including Shell, have argued that their legacy fossil-fuel businesses are key to funding shareholder payouts and investments in lower-carbon energy.
"At first sight I don't think splitting Shell will help in the fight against the climate crisis because we think it's better to generate as much cash as possible from existing businesses and invest this in renewable energy," said Mark van Baal of Follow This, a group of more than 7,000 shareholders in oil companies including Shell. The group has pushed Shell to accelerate its shift to lower-carbon energy.
Political pressure on oil companies is also increasing. Executives from top oil companies including Shell and Exxon are set to be questioned by a congressional committee in Washington on Thursday about whether they knew about the role of fossil fuels in global warming.
The oil industry was hard hit during the pandemic by the fall in demand for gasoline for cars and jet fuel for planes, with some companies resorting to dividend cuts. Shell reduced its dividend by two-thirds in April 2020, the first cut since World War II. This year, oil prices have rallied as demand has recovered amid a pickup in economic activity. That has buoyed profits at Shell in recent quarters.
New York-based Third Point has more than $19 billion under management. While it is well-known for activism campaigns, including one at Intel Corp., the firm also makes typical hedge-fund and friendly investments. Intel tapped VMware Inc.'s Pat Gelsinger as its new chief executive earlier this year a few weeks after Third Point urged the chip-making giant to make changes, a move the hedge fund applauded.
Third Point's flagship fund is up about 30% so far this year, according to the letter.

Full text: HERNANDARIAS, Paraguay -- Most years, when rains are normal, four Olympic swimming pools worth of water passes each second through the mammoth Itaipu Dam, churning out electricity for both Paraguay and Brazil and allowing ships and barges to export grains as far away as China.
Since 2019, however, rainfall levels have dropped sharply -- not just here, but in much of the heart of South America -- and left a vast swath baking in drought. Dozens of hydroelectric dams in Brazil have sputtered, driving up energy prices there. And the river transport of soybeans, the regional cash cow, has been severely hampered in the grain hub of Rosario, Argentina.
But it is Paraguay, a landlocked country of seven million encircled by giant neighbors and dependent on two large rivers, that has been hardest hit, say government officials, climate scientists and the business people who depend on the waterways. The dry season occurs annually, but this region hasn't suffered through a drought this extreme since the 1940s, they say.
With world leaders preparing for the global climate conference that begins on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland, Paraguay offers one look at what changing weather patterns may mean, long term, to those countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
This California-size country of grain fields, cattle pastures and groves of fruit is powered by its two rivers, the Parana and the Paraguay, together measuring 4,657 miles. The rivers provide drinking water for cities and serve as arteries connecting Paraguay to the outside world -- the highways by which agricultural exports help feed 80 million people abroad while permitting imports of fuel, machinery, chemicals and fertilizers.
"It's been 25 years since we produced such little energy," said Hugo Zarate, the superintendent of operations at Itaipu, the world's second-biggest dam in electricity production after China's Three Gorges Dam. "This drought prolonged itself all of 2020, and we thought in 2021 we'd do better. But the drought got worse, and the water flow decreased even more."
The consequences for Paraguay, which uses its rivers for 96% of its commerce, is seen at the private grain silos and loading port on the Parana River run by the agro-industry giant, Trociuk Industries.
Earlier this month, the water level was so low the giant barge convoys in a country with the third-largest barge fleet couldn't haul grain for export. Instead, the grain was loaded on trucks that had to take two-lane roads to the deeper Paraguay River, where barges were loading at 50% capacity.
The cost is huge -- and unsustainable. While a truck can carry 30 tons of grain, a barge can carry up to 2,000 tons. And the convoy of barges that normally ply the rivers here can haul 30,000 tons, a job that would take 350 trucks.
At the Itaipu dam on the Parana, water flow has been down since 2019 by more than 30%. And revenue for Paraguay from the dam is projected to tumble 40% this year to $365 million, 2.8% of the government's budget, about half of what it was in 2016. This year, the dam -- run jointly by Brazil and Paraguay -- is expected to generate 65,000 gigawatt-hours, down from the record of 103,000 GW hours in 2016.
The drop has strained Brazil's energy grid, which depends on Itaipu for 11% of its power. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, asked Brazilians to avoid using elevators and otherwise cut back on power use. "Help us," he said last month on his Facebook page.
While droughts can happen regularly and be caused by complex circumstances, one factor in the long dry spells might be found hundreds of miles away in the Amazon. Some climate scientists say evidence appears to show that deforestation in the world's largest rainforest is altering weather patterns, with the dry season growing hotter and drier as rain levels fall below normal in the rainy season.
An area about the size of Missouri has been deforested in the Brazilian Amazon since 2004. Farmland has replaced the trees that Lonnie Thompson, a climatologist who studies hydrology in Latin America, says produce much of the rainwater through evaporation.
Dr. Norman Breuer, a Paraguayan scientist who studies the impact of climate on agriculture, said that while it is probable that climate change may be leading to longer, drier droughts, he said it can't be determined with certainty until there is a long trend line of intense dry seasons to examine. But he said it is clear, for now, that the La Nina weather phenomenon signals more drought for this coming year.

Full text: Starting in late September, China's top leadership began holding a series of emergency meetings.
An energy crisis had started to engulf the country, propelled by high coal prices. And it wasn't affecting just factories. Social media showed cars driving on pitch dark roads, people eating dinner by cellphone light and families stuck in elevators that had shut off.
Fears of a prolonged energy shortage and a winter of discontent were growing.
The scramble by Chinese leaders to address the crisis during the past month coincided with Beijing's preparations for a United Nations climate summit in Scotland, highlighting China's challenge balancing international pressure to speed up its shift away from fossil fuels and the need to keep the supply of energy stable at home.
Major climate declarations Beijing had planned ahead of the summit were delayed as leaders worried about laying out ambitious climate plans to a global audience, while the country tries to ensure there is enough coal to heat households and keep factories going, say people familiar with the discussions.
China published part of its road map for how to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and reach carbon neutrality before 2060 on Sunday, less than a week before the Glasgow summit. China's climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, had told his European counterparts the road map would be unveiled in early October, according to people familiar with the talks.
Eager to appear a major player in the battle against climate change, China often times its climate pledges around international gatherings. President Xi Jinping said at a summit in the spring that China would start reducing its coal consumption after 2025. At last year's U.N. General Assembly, Mr. Xi changed the date for when China's carbon emissions will peak from "around" to "before" 2030. Some advanced economies have been asking China to move the date forward even further.
The 16-page document unveiled Sunday mostly reaffirms already announced commitments. But a target for oil consumption to plateau between 2026 and 2030 indicates that China's carbon emissions are set to peak close to 2025 levels, say analysts.
On Tuesday, China's State Council released an action plan with more specific targets for reaching peak emissions before 2030. China still hasn't formally submitted its updated emissions-reduction targets to the United Nations, a step it had been expected to make ahead of the Glasgow summit. Alok Sharma, the U.K. climate envoy who is organizing the summit, has said that responses from the world's biggest economies will be crucial for its success.
Last week, Mr. Xie, China's climate envoy, said China is working for COP26's success.
Energy-sector experts say China's electricity crunch, its worst in two decades, is mainly the product of a fundamental mishandling of the energy markets by China's leaders.
While coal prices are set by the market, electricity prices are regulated by the central government. So when faced with skyrocketing global coal prices, power companies were unable to pass along the higher costs to consumers.
On Sept. 24, a benchmark price for thermal coal reached 1,079 yuan, equivalent to $169, almost double the price from the 580 yuan in early March.
According to people familiar with recent deliberations, government agencies and state-owned companies have blamed the crisis partly on policies advocated by Premier Li Keqiang to control the price of electricity. The State Council and the National Commission for Development and Reform didn't respond to requests to comment.
President Xi came down on the side of easing price controls, according to two people familiar with the debates. On Oct. 12, China said it would allow the price of coal-fired electricity to fluctuate within a 20% range, up from the 10% range earlier, and to float freely for heavy users.
With winter approaching, when temperatures in the northeast can sink well below minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, the National Development and Reform Commission said on Oct. 19 that it would use all necessary means stipulated by China's Price Law, which lets the government limit profit and prices for key goods, to roll back record-high coal prices. It has ordered all coal mines to operate at full capacity and issued approvals for new mines.
Climate and energy experts see China's increase of coal production as a temporary measure and many remain confident in Beijing's commitment to its climate goals, though they say the crisis has laid bare some of the challenges.

Full text: SYDNEY -- Australia formally adopted a plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 days before the start of a United Nations climate summit, ending its status as an outlier among developed nations, many of which already had set such a target.
But Prime Minister Scott Morrison disappointed environmental groups by not committing to a more ambitious emissions-reduction goal for 2030. Many scientists say stronger action is needed to reduce emissions this decade if nations are to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the goal in the Paris climate accord.
The announcement Tuesday caps years of internal debate about whether Australia, one of the world's biggest coal exporters and greenhouse-gas emitters per capita, should adopt the target. Mr. Morrison has spent the past few weeks negotiating a climate deal with members of his center-right governing coalition who represent regional areas, where many coal mines and gas fields are located.
The prime minister once brandished a lump of coal in Parliament and his party scrapped a carbon tax in 2014. However, pressure has been building both at home and abroad for Mr. Morrison to change tack. Officials from the U.S. and the U.K. have said they expected him to do more to reduce emissions.
Mr. Morrison likely will face an election next year in which climate policy could be a major issue, particularly after the devastating 2019-20 wildfires, which scientists linked in part to climate change. He has a slim majority in Australia's lower house of Parliament, where governments are formed, so the loss of just a couple of seats could affect the result.
Australia has become steadily hotter during the past century, with most warming occurring since 1950, says the nation's Bureau of Meteorology. The mean temperature from 2011 to 2020 was the highest on record, at nearly a full degree Celsius above average, bureau data show.

Full text: Wealthy governments won't fulfill a pledge to provide $100 billion a year to help developing countries fight climate change until at least 2023, according to a new report from climate negotiators, a setback that comes days before a United Nations climate summit in Scotland.
The pledge was a key part of the 2015 Paris climate accord, helping to persuade developing nations to sign the deal and commit to limit their own emissions. Rich nations said they would funnel $100 billion a year from 2020 to 2025 to poorer countries to help them transition to greener energy and adapt to the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and drought.
The report, published Monday by the U.K., which is hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow that begins Sunday, said donor nations likely fell about $20 billion short of hitting the target in 2020, largely due to a shortfall of private financing. The report said modeling by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of wealthy countries, showed the $100 billion target could be achieved by 2023.
The shortfall is raising tensions between developed and developing nations as they plan to meet to debate how to keep the climate targets of the Paris agreement within reach. The deal calls for countries to keep global warming well below 2 degrees centigrade by the end of the century compared with the preindustrial era, and strive to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. A U.N. report last month found that emissions-reduction plans submitted under the Paris deal would limit warming to around 2.7 degrees.
U.K. COP26 President Alok Sharma said missing the target is "extremely unfortunate," but that he remains confident that developed nations could hand half a trillion dollars to poor countries by 2025. "What we have tried to do here . . . is give confidence about what will come in future years," he said.
For decades, Western countries responsible for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions have pledged to pay poorer nations to help them with what is expected to be a very expensive global-energy transition. Developing nations say the funding is essential for them to agree to deeper emission cuts at the Glasgow summit. Negotiators saw providing clarity around the $100 billion a year pledge as a way to build trust ahead of the talks.
Based on recent estimates from the OECD, climate finance provided and mobilized by developed countries increased from $58.5 billion in 2016 to $79.6 billion in 2019. For the third year straight the amount raised by rich countries seems to have plateaued around the $80 billion mark.
"This $100 billion per year is not really happening as it's supposed to," Nirmala Sitharaman, India's finance minister, said recently. "We need to remind everyone that it has to happen."
Developed-nation officials acknowledge that the cost of the developing nations' response to climate change ultimately would require far more than $100 billion. In Glasgow, they will be negotiating over how much of the bill rich nations should be on the hook to supply from their government budgets and mobilize from private investors. Western officials are counting on the private sector to pick up much of the tab.
"We do need to see the private sector step up," said Canadian Environmental Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, who co-wrote the report. "We need to see trillions of dollars mobilized for this, not a hundred billion."
Diplomats including U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and U.K. COP President Mr. Sharma have crisscrossed the globe trying to get nations to raise their financial pledges. The Biden administration has pledged to double climate funding to developing countries to $11.4 billion annually by 2024, subject to approval by Congress, which would make the U.S. by far the biggest single benefactor.
Mr. Sharma commissioned the report from Mr. Wilkinson and Jochen Flasbarth, state secretary at Germany's Environment Ministry. The report concluded that, based on private submissions made to the OECD, public and private funding for the plan would comfortably exceed $100 billion by 2025.
Most of the existing shortfall is due to be made up by public money. So far pension funds, insurance companies and other major institutional investors have proved uncomfortable funding renewable-energy projects in countries they perceive to be higher risk.
Officials said there was internal debate about how conservatively to treat projections on private financing. An earlier draft of the report estimated the $100 billion target would be reached in 2022 based on more aggressive predictions about private investors' risk appetite, officials say.

Full text: RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia pledged to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2060 ahead of a United Nations climate summit, as one of the world's top oil producers resists calls to cut investment in new oil-and-gas development.
The kingdom plans to cut carbon emissions by over 270 million tons a year, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in a prerecorded address to a climate forum in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia is set to invest more than $186 billion to achieve that goal, he said. Bahrain joined Saudi Arabia on Sunday in aiming to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2060.
John Kerry, President Biden's special envoy for climate change, traveled to Saudi Arabia over the weekend for private meetings. He is to speak on Monday alongside Crown Prince Mohammed at the Riyadh summit gathering of Middle East heads of state to discuss strategies to meet the impact of climate change in the region, including cutting emissions.
The Saudi target is less ambitious than those of the International Energy Agency, a group representing industrialized energy consumers, and the U.K.-led COP26 climate-talks presidency, which are both recommending reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
It also doesn't include emissions from the massive amounts of oil Saudi Arabia exports around the world for energy use by countries like China and India. The kingdom pumps about one in 10 barrels of oil consumed each day in the world.
"The world's largest oil exporter becoming a net-zero economy, the optics of it look strange," said Ben Cahill, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "These two things are not mutually exclusive: You can both decarbonize your oil and gas production and reduce economywide carbon emissions, and still be a really large oil and gas exporter."
The Saudi economy remains heavily dependent on revenue from oil and gas sales, despite an aggressive public campaign to diversify away from fossil fuel. More recently, Riyadh has redoubled its commitment to those exports, investing to produce even more crude.
Saudi Arabia is also pushing fellow oil producers to present a united front and oppose rising calls for a reduction in fossil-fuel investment ahead of the COP26 summit that kicks off Oct. 31 in Glasgow, Scotland.
Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has argued that the IEA's 2050 target would reduce supply before global demand drops significantly, risking an oil-price superspike and unfairly burdening economies that are overly dependent on importing or exporting oil and gas.
Oil-producing countries have emerged as a formidable group that is resisting what they describe as an unrealistic push by rich nations to limit fossil-fuel investment as a way of lowering greenhouse-gas emissions.
Saudi Arabia has said it is committed to investing in its oil fields to expand production and has no plans to curb such spending, people familiar with its position said.
Prince Abdulaziz said Saturday Saudi Arabia may hit the target before 2060 but it chose that year because U.N. experts expect most climate technologies won't mature before 2040.
"We need to have that time and that space to allow us to do this properly," Prince Abdulaziz said. "The 2060 (target) will enable us to have a smooth and viable transition without risking economic or social impacts."
Robin Mills, chief executive of Dubai-based consulting firm Qamar Energy, said the 2060 target was reasonable for Saudi Arabia given the challenge it faces as one of the world's top oil exporters. "It gives them the moral upper ground: We are now part of the solution, not the problem," he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The White House, its climate agenda mired in congressional wrangling, is hoping to show world leaders at the Glasgow climate summit that the U.S. can still meet President Biden's pledge to dramatically reduce emissions despite recent legislative setbacks.
The Biden administration plan includes a series of executive actions it says will make significant progress toward meeting the president's pledge to cut U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030.
These include tougher methane rules for oil and gas production that are expected to be announced ahead of the summit, followed by more-stringent emissions limits on vehicles later this year.
U.S. greenhouse emissions have already fallen roughly 20% from 2005 levels, according to analysts. But emissions are expected to tick up as the global economy reopens after the height of the coronavirus pandemic.
The goal for White House officials is to convince world leaders that the U.S. is making concrete progress on further reductions. Climate negotiators from nearly every country will gather for two weeks in Scotland starting on Oct. 31 to hammer out a new agreement aimed at cutting emissions.
During a CNN town hall on Thursday night, Mr. Biden called climate change an "existential threat to humanity." But analysts and even White House allies agree the administration needs action from Congress to fund the deep changes to the economy required to meet Mr. Biden's goals.
That effort has been complicated by opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), an influential coal-state Democrat who is pushing to scale back climate-related measures. Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders in Congress have proposed spending hundreds of billions of dollars on measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions as part of a plan that was originally pegged at $3.5 trillion but is now likely to be closer to $2 trillion.
Gina McCarthy, Mr. Biden's national climate adviser, said the White House is still optimistic that Congress will include significant funding for programs to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, despite likely cuts -- including a $150 billion program aimed at pushing utilities to shift to cleaner sources of fuel.
"The conversations between the president and Congress are beginning to really accelerate," Ms. McCarthy said. But even if congressional action stalls, she said, "we will already have identified a number of ways in which we can underpin that [climate commitment] and show the rest of the world that we're getting back in a leadership position."
Mr. Biden's aides are working on a new U.S. climate strategy that will outline options for meeting the target, but it may not be released publicly in time for the Glasgow summit.
U.S. officials believe there are multiple pathways for meeting the target, but expect to rely at least in part on the remaining climate measures in the scaled-back legislation, like renewable-energy tax credits.
Earlier this year, the administration formed a task force of senior agency officials charged with coming up with dozens of actions across the federal government intended to address the effects of climate change. The product of their work, the national climate strategy, will be released by the end of the year.
The administration is also working on a longer-term climate strategy, according to officials, that will lay out a road map for getting to the net zero U.S. emissions by 2050 that Mr. Biden has proposed.
Beyond congressional action, Environmental Protection Agency regulations are at the core of the administration's near-term effort to meet the target. Officials expect to propose new requirements for oil-and-gas companies to control their methane emissions before Mr. Biden leaves for Glasgow.
Higher efficiency standards for passenger cars and trucks and heavy-duty vehicles would play an even bigger role and could arrive in new proposals before year's end.
White House officials have been calling businesses in recent days to seek support for their efforts amid the move in Congress to shrink the spending proposal.
Energy companies and manufacturers have been among those that have been in touch with the administration, the people said. The administration reached out to Carrier Global Corp. and Siemens AG, among others, according to one of the people.
Some companies have been hesitant to accept the cost of Mr. Biden's congressional agenda.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has promised to "do everything we can to prevent this tax-raising, job killing" bill.
A group of 15 companies, including PepsiCo Inc. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, sent a letter this week to congressional leaders saying they support the bill's climate provisions but are concerned about how the bill raises money, requesting a discussion of "alternative options."

Full text: Bitcoin mining has earned a bad reputation for guzzling electricity in the pursuit of profit. Now bitcoin miners are trying to go green, to a point.
Companies that mine bitcoin are aiming to power their computers with renewable energy or sign up for data centers that rely on the sun or wind. Falling prices for renewables and rising prices for bitcoin make it possible to still earn a profit.
But much of bitcoin mining still relies on fossil fuels, including coal, the cheapest and dirtiest power source. "Crypto has a carbon-intensity problem," said Paolo Natali, principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute's Climate Intelligence program.
That problem led to the creation of the Crypto Climate Accord in April, a voluntary framework that asks cryptocurrency firms to reduce net carbon emissions from electricity to zero by 2030. Some 180 companies have signed up, Mr. Natali said.
The miners say they are thinking about the environment, but they have other incentives to reduce their carbon emissions: Investors, who increasingly are making carbon emissions part of their research, are pressing them to do better.
Legislators in New York state are considering a bill banning the use of fossil fuels to mine bitcoin and are calling for miners to document their carbon footprints. The Securities and Exchange Commission also is considering measures requiring publicly traded companies to disclose climate data.
Many of the most lucrative cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, use an energy-intensive process called proof of work to validate transactions. That requires significant computing power, which requires lots of electricity.
The lower the price of electricity, the bigger the profit. The cheapest sources are sometimes the dirtiest, leading some miners to restart previously decommissioned coal-fired plants. In places with abundant renewable resources, mixing green power with coal, natural gas or other sources can give miners an edge.
"If you are mining crypto, you care about the cost of electricity and you don't have the luxury to care about the climate so much," said Alex de Vries, an economist who created the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index.
Gryphon Digital Mining joined the Crypto Climate Accord in May and says it has achieved net-zero carbon emissions. It got there by launching a 21-megawatt facility powered by hydroelectric power and signing up with a digital hosting company that gets more than half of its power from renewable sources. It fills the gap by buying carbon offset credits, the same way an airline passenger can offset the carbon emissions.
"It's because we wanted to be corporate good stewards of the world," said Gryphon Chief Executive Rob Chang.
About 76% of firms mining proof-of-work cryptocurrencies combine green and fossil-fuel power sources, but less than 40% of the total energy used to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies comes from renewable sources, according to a survey of 280 crypto firms by the University of Cambridge's Centre for Alternative Finance.
Still, the renewable energy used by crypto miners could force utilities to generate additional power using fossil fuels, Mr. de Vries said.
Bitcoin miners in El Salvador harness green energy from a volcanic region to power operations. Despite having an abundance of renewable resources, the Central American nation imported nearly 20% of the fuel used to generate electricity in 2019, according to the International Trade Administration.
"If you put green energy into bitcoin miners you need to up your fossil-fuel imports," Mr. de Vries said. "You're just displacing the problem."
Cryptocurrency mining has increased in the U.S. and Canada after China banned transactions with bitcoin and its ilk. The U.S. and Canada accounted for 45% of global bitcoin-mining activity in August, up from 12% in January, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. Bitcoin-mining activity declined 20% during that period after miners based in China were shut down.
Some of the crypto world's most important companies are now focusing on carbon emissions. A spokesman for publicly traded digital coin exchange Coinbase said the company is now focusing on environmental issues and will announce actions addressing climate change in the coming weeks.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Rising global temperatures pose a growing risk to U.S. national security, as nations battle over who will pay for climate change's costs, maneuver for advantage in a melting Arctic, and grapple with effects such as drought and migration, a new U.S. intelligence report said.
The National Intelligence Estimate is the first of its kind to look at the link between climate change and national security. It projects that nations will fail to meet their pledges to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius, with that mark being passed around 2030.
Instead, the report portrays climate change as a new geopolitical battleground.
Poor nations disproportionately affected will demand help from wealthier ones, it said. China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, the fourth-largest, will struggle to wean themselves from burning coal. Some countries could unilaterally deploy geoengineering technologies to cool their climates, sparking conflict.
As countries grapple with rising temperatures, "We think the risk of geopolitical tensions will rise over the coming years," said a U.S. intelligence official involved in drafting the report.
The report was ordered by President Biden in January and was produced by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The declassified version released Thursday projects trends to the year 2040, and is based on "the broad consensus of scientific studies, modeling and forecasts" from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. National Climate Assessment and U.S. government agencies.
"We are aware of, but in this estimate do not rely on, the small minority scientific perspectives on climate change ranging from those who consider it nonexistent to those who view it as a near-term existential threat to humanity," the document says.
The intelligence assessment comes ahead of an international conference on global warming that begins in Glasgow, Scotland, on Oct. 31.
"Global momentum is growing for more ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reductions, but current policies and pledges are insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement goals," the report says, referring to accords reached in 2015.
"Countries are arguing about who should act sooner and competing to control the growing clean energy transition," it adds.
Mr. Biden has pledged to make climate change a more central feature in U.S. foreign policy. His administration on Thursday also released a Pentagon report on the strategic risks posed by climate change, and said it was creating an interagency working group to mitigate the impacts of climate change on human migration.
The intelligence report says that two regions -- the Pacific islands and central Africa -- are especially vulnerable to the effects of rising temperatures, as are 11 countries outside those regions. They are Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia, Haiti, North Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Myanmar.

Full text: Democrats in Washington remain divided over the scope of President Biden's expansive domestic policy agenda. But their voters -- both moderate and progressive -- have largely rallied around the push to increase government spending and say they worry lawmakers won't reach an agreement.
Negotiations gained momentum this week after Mr. Biden in meetings with Democratic lawmakers identified programs that would likely be cut or shortened in the final bill to trim costs. Party leaders said they could have a framework for a deal by week's end, though many provisions -- and how to pay for them -- remain under discussion.
Several recent polls, bolstered by interviews with more than 50 Democratic voters across six swing states in recent weeks, indicate broad party support for legislation to expand social safety net programs and pass measures aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change.
Democratic leaders have proposed paying for well over a trillion dollars in expanded government services, in part, by higher taxes. Top Democrats acknowledge that would have been considered too liberal a few years ago but say that it now has broad party support. At least one Democrat in the Senate has voiced opposition to the idea.
Most of the Democratic voters interviewed said they believed that if their elected leaders didn't act on the most ambitious legislation possible, the party risked losing congressional seats in next year's midterm elections and the White House in 2024.
A CNN poll released last week found that 75% of Democrats preferred a bill that included all of the social safety net and climate-change provisions proposed by Mr. Biden. Another 20% of respondents backed a scaled-back bill that costs less. A Pew Research Center poll released in September similarly found that among those who identify as Democrats or lean Democratic, 75% said they favored Mr. Biden's $3.5 trillion proposal.
When Republicans and independents were included, the CNN poll found that 41% of Americans supported a package with all the proposed provisions; another 30% supported a scaled-down bill. The same Pew survey found 49% of Americans supported the original $3.5 trillion package.
Many of the Democratic voters interviewed also said they were frustrated with the Biden administration and congressional Democrats over issues including voting rules and immigration. Yet, they said, the social policy and climate package, and a separate infrastructure proposal, were unifying priorities.
"The Democrats have the majority right now, why don't they pull the trigger?" said Andre Edmonds, a 35-year-old welder in West Palm Beach, Fla. "If they don't get it done, Donald Trump is gonna be president." Former President Trump hasn't said he will run again but has indicated he is considering a 2024 bid.
Democratic lawmakers and Mr. Biden's aides say they have a narrow window to pass major initiatives before lawmakers turn their attention to campaigns for next year's midterm election. Failure could depress turnout, they say, possibly costing the party its narrow majorities in the House and Senate.
Depending on its final contours, the package could include expanded paid family and medical leave, prekindergarten for every 3- and 4-year-old and an expansion of Medicare benefits.
Democrats would address climate change with provisions intended to substantially reduce carbon emissions. The proposal has become tied to a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package that passed the Senate. House progressives have said they won't vote for it until there is agreement on the larger legislation. A tug of war over the bottom line has slowed negotiations.
This summer, the president and Democratic leaders settled on a $3.5 trillion package, saying it would be paid for by taxes and other sources of revenue and offsets. Progressive Democratic lawmakers, who typically represent safe seats and seldom worry about courting swing voters, had said anything lower meant important programs would be lost or trimmed. They have since said they were willing to negotiate. Mr. Biden has floated a roughly $2 trillion package as a compromise.
Moderate lawmakers, many of whom represent competitive states or districts, have concerns about cost. Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona wouldn't support the initial price tag. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Ms. Sinema has pushed back on raising taxes to pay for the legislation.
Most Democratic voters say they are ready to move forward. The voters interviewed were from different age groups and racial and ethnic backgrounds, and their views span the Democratic Party's ideological spectrum. They live in swing states that will help determine next year which party holds power in the Senate: Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire and Florida. Most of the voter interviews were conducted in person, including at an Italian festival in Scranton, Pa., a Democratic event in Phoenix, and a food hall in downtown Durham, N.C. Journal reporters asked passersby about their views. Others were identified through WSJ/NBC polling and reached by phone.
Tom Dunn, a 52-year-old firefighter and lobbyist for related issues, said he supported Mr. Biden's agenda, no matter the price tag. The proposals, he said, were "a once-in-a-generation push to have federal funding for certain activities and priorities that benefit the entire country."
Mr. Dunn, of Reno, Nev., left the Republican Party in 2018 and identified himself as a moderate Democrat. He said the climate-change provisions would mitigate the growing frequency of catastrophic wildfires. He supports the proposed tax increases, saying those who make the most "have the ability of giving a little more," a sentiment shared by others interviewed.
Mr. Biden is at the center of a party that has shifted leftward with ambitious goals to match. He is seen as more moderate than such liberals as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), and more progressive than Sens. Sinema and Manchin.
Mr. Dunn said he was frustrated with Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema, a view repeated by others. The two centrist senators are negotiating with Mr. Biden and top Democrats over what they will support. Representatives for Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema declined requests for comment.
Senate Democrats hope to pass the legislation through reconciliation with 50 votes and a tiebreaker by Vice President Kamala Harris. With no GOP backers, they can't afford to lose a single senator on their side of the aisle.
"I am so frustrated with them," Elizabeth Beaty, a 63-year-old retiree of Scottsdale, Ariz., said of the two senators. "Actually, frustrated is not a strong enough word."
Ms. Sinema hasn't publicly detailed what she wants to keep in the package. Mr. Manchin has said it should be closer to $1.5 trillion.
Opponents say the legislation is too expensive, and many don't agree with the idea of raising taxes to pay for it. Another criticism is that the social policy proposals would give the government too much control over the lives of Americans. Some who oppose the package say the proposed climate measures would harm the oil-and-gas industry and cost jobs.
Republicans say Mr. Biden's proposed package shows that the Democratic Party's left flank has taken over. "This is the most extreme agenda since I've been up here," said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), who served with Mr. Biden in the Senate. "He was always somebody you could do business with, always trying to find common ground. I don't see that guy at all."
The Democratic voters interviewed said they weren't too concerned about the cost. "As a working mom for a time when my son was younger, it was challenging. To have more services provided to our women -- to anybody really -- it's gonna put them back in the workforce," said Kim Eiden, 53, a self-described moderate from Scranton, Pa.
Lisa McMurtray, 21, a student in Orlando, Fla., said congressional negotiations should move faster.
Another supporter of the package, Michael Burgess, 27, a high-school teacher in Raleigh, N.C., said he didn't have a hard limit on how much the government should spend. After all, he said, the budget hasn't been balanced for a long time.
Over the past several years, many Democrats have coalesced around increased government spending and taxing the wealthy and corporations to pay for programs.
Democratic lawmakers have already used their narrow majorities to pass a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package early in the president's tenure.
Mr. Biden's overall approval rating has since fallen. The Fivethirtyeight.com aggregate of public polling this week put his average approval rating at 45%, a 5-point drop since mid-August. Surveys show that Mr. Biden's numbers have fallen among independents but remain strong among Democrats.
Matt Munsey, chairman of the Northampton County Democratic Party in Pennsylvania, said local Democratic support of Mr. Biden's proposals goes up when voters learn more details and that it would raise taxes on the wealthy to help pay for new programs.
"People like what they're hearing," he said, "and just want to see something get done."

Full text: A research group backed by some of the world's biggest investment firms plans to help investors make sense of businesses' climate-change plans by assessing data from 10,000 companies and making the results public.
The Transition Pathway Initiative said it plans to open a research center next year at the London School of Economics, called the TPI Global Climate Transition Centre, that will publish the assessments.
The initiative marks a major expansion of TPI's work, pointing to investor appetite for standards and data that let them compare companies by their environmental performance. TPI currently scores about 400 companies on their management of climate change.
The group said it is supported by more than 100 investment firms representing a total of $40 trillion in assets. BlackRock Inc., the world's largest money manager, said it joined the list of TPI backers, which include abrdn PLC, BNP Paribas Asset Management and Legal & General Investment Management.
"There's a whole variety of ways companies set net-zero targets and commitments and it's very hard to assess those in a consistent way," said David Harris, head of sustainable finance products at London Stock Exchange Group PLC, which also works with TPI.

Full text: At a July global climate gathering in London, South African environment minister Barbara Creecy presented the world's wealthiest countries with a bill: more than $750 billion annually to pay for poorer nations to shift away from fossil fuels and protect themselves from global warming.
The number was met with silence from U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry, according to Zaheer Fakir, an adviser to Ms. Creecy. Other Western officials said they weren't ready to discuss such a huge sum.
For decades, Western countries responsible for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions have pledged to pay to bring poorer nations along with them in what is expected to be a very expensive global energy transition. But they have yet to fully deliver on that promise. Now the price of the developing world's cooperation is going up.
At the end of the month, negotiators from nearly every country will meet in Glasgow, Scotland, for a two-week climate summit, the first major gathering since governments signed the Paris accord in 2015. The goal is to strike a deal to keep the climate targets of the Paris agreement within reach.
Without poorer countries on board, the world stands little chance of preventing catastrophic climate change, say many climate scientists. Emissions in the U.S. and Europe are falling as both regions push to adopt renewable energy and phase out coal-fired electricity. But emissions in the developing world are expected to rise sharply in the coming decades as billions rise out of poverty -- unless those economies can shift onto a lower-carbon path.
Before signing on, poorer countries are demanding a big increase in funding from the developed world to adopt cleaner technologies and adapt to the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels and more powerful storms.
Bangladesh says it needs cyclone-resistant housing. Kenya wants its countryside dotted with solar farms instead of coal or natural gas-fired plants. India says its climate-change plan alone will cost more than $2.5 trillion through 2030.
"We cannot be talking about ambition on the one hand, and yet you show no ambition on finance," said Mr. Fakir who is coordinating climate finance policies for the Group of 77, a coalition of developing nations.
Developed nations say it is unrealistic to put them on the hook for such a large sum without also getting middle-income countries -- China in particular -- to provide funds. In Paris in 2015, the U.S., Europe and a few other wealthy nations committed to funding poorer countries to the tune of $100 billion a year from 2020 through 2025. They have so far fallen short.
Developing-world negotiators say the money isn't financial aid. Rather, they say wealthy countries have a responsibility to pay under the U.N. climate treaties because most of the Earth's warming since the industrial era is the result of emissions from the rich world. Moreover, poor nations now face the task of raising living standards without burning fossil fuels unchecked as rich nations did for almost two centuries.
"If you're going to ask a much poorer country to forgo that option, then there is a moral claim that they need support to go on a lower emissions development pathway," said Joe Thwaites, a climate-finance expert at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank.
Even developed countries are struggling with the transition to renewables. A surge in demand for power from nations recovering from the pandemic has forced governments to lean on fossil fuels; though investment in renewables has increased, it accounts for only about a quarter of the world's power.
Western officials say the Glasgow negotiations need to focus first on how to raise enough money to meet the Paris goal. Then they are planning to begin talks on a finance goal for after 2025. That sum is expected to be too large to pay from government budgets alone, officials say. Instead they are counting on private investors to pick up most of the bill.
"There isn't enough official development funds in the system to close the gap of climate finance," said Gustavo Alberto Fonseca, director of programs at the U.N.'s Global Environment Facility, which funds climate infrastructure in the developing world. "There has to be a market-based solution."
Developing nations want a big portion of the money to come as government grants, not private loans that would saddle them with debt. They're demanding control over how the money is spent, wary of dictates from wealthy governments and financiers in the U.S. and Europe.
The developing world also questions whether the U.S. is committed to delivering its portion of the funds over the long haul. The Biden administration has pledged to double climate funding to developing countries to $11.4 billion annually by 2024, which would make the U.S. by far the biggest single benefactor. President Donald Trump reneged on previous promises the Obama administration made to finance the Green Climate Fund, the U.N.'s main vehicle for delivering money to the developing world, saying the fund "was costing the United States a vast fortune."
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of wealthy countries, says the developed world had accounted for $80 billion in climate financing to poor countries in 2019, the most recent year for which data are available. It is unlikely that they reached the $100 billion target in 2020, officials say.
Private-sector investors haven't piled into investment projects as expected. Only $14 billion of the $80 billion came from the private sector, according to the OECD. That's because pension funds, insurance companies and other major institutional investors are uncomfortable funding renewable-energy projects in countries they perceive to be higher risk.
Officials say private investors are ill-suited for underwriting other pressing needs: projects that help developing nations adapt to the effects of climate change. Seawalls that protect against rising sea levels and programs to teach farmers to grow drought-resistant crops don't generate revenue to compensate investors, unlike a solar farm that sells electricity onto the grid.
To entice private investors, wealthy governments are putting taxpayer money on the line, accepting first losses on projects that don't work out. BlackRock Inc, the giant investment manager, has launched a $250 million facility alongside the development agencies of France, Germany and other countries to provide climate financing to the developing world.
"If we just had institutional capital alone, we might be much more constrained in where we could go," said Jim Barry, BlackRock's chief investment officer for alternative investments.
Climate funding is channeled through more than two dozen different agencies, each with their own rules and requirements. Some of the requirements -- such as one demonstrating that a climate project advances gender equality -- reflect the prerogatives of wealthy nations. Others are designed to give developing countries more say over how the funds are spent.
"Sometimes I argue it's not worth pursuing some little amount of money, because the energy, time and resources for developing a proposal are not worth it," said Mizan Khan, a climate negotiator for Bangladesh, one of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
The Green Climate Fund is the cornerstone of the U.N.'s strategy for channeling funds to the developing world. Launched in 2015, the fund can dole out grants or enlist private investors. By taking on the riskiest slice of financing on climate-change projects, the fund aims to leverage huge sums of private capital with a relatively small contribution of its own funds.
The GCF helped launch renewable energy in Egypt by financing a huge solar farm in Benban, 400 miles south of Cairo, and wind turbines on the Gulf of Suez. The GCF gave a $15 million grant for technical consulting for the Egyptian electricity sector and lent $150 million for the project in 2017, when Egypt's political turmoil meant foreign capital was only available at high interest rates. Other investors put $850 million into the project. Since then, investors have flooded into Egyptian solar projects, driving down the price of solar power sharply.
Efforts to scale up the GCF's financial firepower, however, have been beset with disputes between wealthy and developing countries as well as frequent leadership changes.
"The work environment in the fund is very adversarial," said Wael Aboulmagd, a senior Egyptian diplomat who is on the fund's board.
At a July 2018 meeting, board members spent days arguing over new policies sought by wealthy countries, such as an update to the fund's stance on gender equality and allowing the board to make decisions without unanimity. Developing-world officials feared rich nations, which were due to pledge more money, were using the moment as leverage to impose their priorities.
The executive director unexpectedly resigned, citing personal reasons. By the end, the bickering left no time for the board to approve funding proposals.
"After this meeting, I cannot see how I can come home and defend why we should put more money into this fund," said Lars Roth, a Swedish representative on the board.
One project that had already been approved, the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund Next, aimed to use $250 million in capital from the GCF to raise another $500 million from private-sector investors. The money was to be seeded into an array of subsidiary funds with more leverage, bringing the project's total investment firepower to $30 billion, to pay for renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects in dozens of countries across the developing world, from Belize to Uganda. It was the Green Climate Fund's most ambitious attempt yet to amplify its money with private-sector finance.
In June 2020 the project was canceled. Under GCF rules, sponsors had asked developing-world governments to preapprove a series of hypothetical projects that could be used to raise money. That provoked resistance from India, Rwanda and others that wanted more control over specific projects.
Yannick Glemarec, the GCF's executive director, said the project was a great idea but beyond the fund's capacity when it was proposed. "We had to start everything from scratch," he said, adding that cooperation between developed and developing nations "is a challenge at times, but I wouldn't swap the legitimacy this gives GCF for any other model."
As Glasgow approaches, wealthy countries are drafting a new plan to hit the Paris agreement's finance target.
"We should be focused on delivering the $100 billion before we start talking about huge numbers," said an adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron.
The developing world disagrees. When Ms. Creecy, the South African minister, demanded $750 billion in annual finance, she wanted to start a discussion that poorer nations felt developed countries were avoiding, said Mr. Fakir.
The figure is based on a formula the Global Environment Facility, a U.N. fund, has used to finance projects in the developing world for decades. The facility typically requires recipient countries and private investors to put up $12 for every dollar provided by the fund. So South African officials simply took the amount of public funds provided directly by developed countries in 2019 -- around $62 billion, according to the OECD -- and multiplied by a factor of 12. Then they rounded up.
In September, African nations used the South African methodology to settle on an even bigger finance demand to be presented in Glasgow: $1.3 trillion annually by 2030.
Alok Sharma, the U.K. climate minister who is leading Glasgow negotiations, said he is focused on pressuring wealthy countries to deliver on the $100 billion target and to provide more money as grants rather than loans. "Every nation has taken a huge hit to their public finances because of Covid," he said. "If you're going to ladle more debt on developing nations, that's not going to be particularly helpful."

Full text: An energy price shock is serving as a reminder of the world's continued dependency on fossil fuels -- even amid efforts to shift to renewable sources of energy.
Demand for oil, coal and natural gas has skyrocketed world-wide in recent weeks as unusual weather conditions and resurgent economies emerging from the pandemic combine to create energy shortages from China to Brazil to the U.K.
The situation has laid bare the fragility of global supplies as countries drive to pivot from fossil fuels to cleaner sources of energy, a shift many investors and governments are trying to accelerate amid concerns about climate change.
The transition figures to be challenging for years to come, energy executives and analysts say, due to a stark reality: While fossil fuel investment is falling, fossil fuels account for most energy -- and green energy spending isn't growing fast enough to fill the gap.
Demand for power remains robust even as supply chains begin to strain. In some cases, supplies of renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power have fallen short of forecasts, further boosting demand for fossil fuels.
The International Energy Agency, a group that advises countries on energy policies, this month projected global oil demand will reach about 99.6 million barrels a day next year, near pre-pandemic levels. It forecasts that coal demand is set to exceed 2019 levels this year and rise somewhat until 2025, though how quickly it falls from there will depend on government actions to phase out the fuel.
"A lot less product is available to meet this now rapid growth we're seeing," Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Darren Woods said in virtual remarks at a conference in Russia Wednesday. "If we don't balance the demand equation and only address the supply, it will lead to additional volatility."
The world's oil production is still rising, but struggling to catch up with a surge in consumption from countries recovering from the pandemic, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Global oil and gas exploration spending, excluding shale, averaged about $100 billion a year from 2010 to 2015, but dropped to an average of around $50 billion in the years that followed after a crash in crude prices, according to Rystad Energy.
Total global oil and gas investment this year will be down about 26% from pre-pandemic levels to $356 billion, the IEA said Wednesday. That is about where it would need to remain for the next decade, before declining further, to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, according to the IEA. The international pact seeks to limit global temperature increases to no more than two degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels, and preferably 1.5 degrees.
To meet global energy demand, as well as climate aspirations, investments in clean energy would need to grow from around $1.1 trillion this year to $3.4 trillion a year until 2030, the Paris-based agency found. Investment would advance technology, transmission and storage, among other things.
"The world isn't investing enough to meet its future energy needs, and uncertainties over policies and demand trajectories create a strong risk of a volatile period ahead for energy markets," the IEA report said. It added that ramping up renewables would require greatly enhanced spending in other sectors, such as mining, to produce and refine the raw materials needed for wind turbines, solar arrays and utility-scale battery storage.
The development of wind and solar farms and other renewable power sources has accelerated within the past two decades as the technologies have dropped in costs due to economies of scale, becoming more competitive with fossil-fuel based electricity generation. Global renewable energy capacity, excluding hydropower and pumped storage, topped 1.5 million megawatts last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, up from less than 55,000 megawatts in 2000.
Greener sources have gained market share in the U.S. and Europe, aided by government subsidies and other policies aimed at reducing the use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. In 2019, before the onset of the pandemic, the U.S. consumed more renewable energy than coal for the first time since 1885.
That growth is expected to continue. The world added 280,000 megawatts of renewable electricity last year, up 45% from the prior year, according to the IEA. The agency called that growth rate "the new normal" and expects similar amounts to be added this year and next year.
Still, fossil fuels make up the majority of power generation globally. Renewables accounted for 26% of global electricity generation in 2019, according to IRENA.
World leaders set to gather for a major climate change conference in Glasgow in two weeks are aiming to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But they are still grappling with core questions that have complicated such negotiations for decades, including whether richer countries will pay to help poorer countries make the shift.
Supply-chain issues also constrain how quickly the world can increase wind and solar power. Most solar arrays are currently produced with energy from coal-fired power plants in China, which supplies more than three fourths of the world's polysilicon. Some Western governments and companies are attempting to shift solar manufacturing away from coal, but that threatens to drive up costs.
In addition to greening the power grid, many countries are advancing policies to speed a shift to electric vehicles. That is poised to reduce the amount of oil used in transportation, which currently makes up around 60% of oil demand according to the IEA. But while nearly all major auto makers including General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG are betting big on EV production, and sales are gaining traction, adoption is expected to be gradual.
In Europe, which experienced a decline in power generation partly due to an unusual slowdown in offshore wind speeds, natural-gas prices have almost tripled in three months, leading some fertilizer makers to halt production because they can no longer produce it economically. In China, electricity shortfalls caused by high coal prices led local officials to curtail hours at some factories, affecting production of semiconductors and other key exports.
The U.S. has been less affected than other countries, but it too has seen higher prices, and concerns about further increases in winter are mounting. On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration warned that the nearly half of American households that primarily warm their homes with natural gas will spend an average of 30% more on their bills compared with last year.
Prices of Brent crude, the global benchmark, topped $85 a barrel Friday, their highest level in three years. Traders are betting prices will continue to rise, stoking the options market.
One factor weighing on crude is that gas and coal shortages are pressuring some power plant operators and manufacturers to burn oil instead.
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, said this month that it plans to increase its oil production capacity from 12 million to 13 million barrels a day by 2027. Rival Abu Dhabi National Oil, the main oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, said it would be spending $122 billion in part to boost its oil production capacity to five million barrels a day by the end of the decade, from about four million a day today.
Overall, OPEC estimates the world is projected to require $11.8 trillion in oil-and-gas investment through 2045 to meet growing demand. In a report released last month, it predicted its members' oil will constitute 39% of global crude consumption in 2045, up from about 33% now.
"We are witnessing strains and conflicts related to energy affordability, energy security and reducing emissions," said Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC's secretary-general, in an interview last month.
Governments trying to fast-track a transition to cleaner sources of energy are finding that it requires vast amounts of investment, and can meet unexpected obstacles. In the U.S., California is in the midst of retiring numerous fossil-fuel power plants to help decarbonize its power grid by 2045, as a state law requires.
The California Public Utilities Commission has ordered utilities to buy an unprecedented amount of renewable energy, battery storage and other carbon-free resources to fill the gap and keep up with growth in coming years: more than 14,000 megawatts, or roughly a third of the state's forecast for peak summer demand.
While the companies are on track thus far, the California Energy Commission and the state's grid operator recently expressed concern that the purchases may not be enough to prevent electricity shortages in the coming summers. The state is also planning to retire its last nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon, which generates nearly 10% of the electricity in the state, by 2025.
California has narrowly avoided rolling blackouts this year, amid wildfires that have disrupted power transmission and a severe drought that has reduced hydroelectric production throughout the West, including from the Hoover Dam.
The state's power grid operator has called on residents to conserve power several times this summer and took emergency measures to buy additional supplies to reduce the risk of blackouts. The state also recently added four temporary natural-gas generators at power plants to help alleviate the shortage.
After years of losing money on America's shale oil boom, which produced ample supplies but few profits, investors and Wall Street financiers alike are clamoring for companies to limit investment in future projects and return cash to them instead.
That push has stunted growth in all but one of the oil fields that fueled the shale boom. Companies like Continental Resources Inc. in North Dakota's Bakken field and EOG Resources Inc. in South Texas' Eagle Ford shale kicked off the boom back when oil often fetched more than $100 a barrel. But producers in those regions have drilled up some of the most prolific land and are running into limitations juicing as much oil from new wells in maturing fields. This year, oil output for almost all of the 20 largest producers in both the Eagle Ford and Bakken has stayed below pre-pandemic levels, according to data from ShaleProfile, an industry analytics platform.
"We're starting the long, long goodbye," Bob Fryklund, a strategist at IHS Markit, said of the Bakken and Eagle Ford plays.
The only place in the contiguous U.S. that shale companies are growing is the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico. But even there, production has yet to fully recover, and the companies dispatching more drilling rigs are typically smaller, private operators that don't have the muscle to lift output significantly. Larger, publicly traded producers have restrained Permian activity, and only eight of the 20 top producers had output above March 2020 levels as of July, the latest ShaleProfile data show.
"We'll be lucky to grow 5% a year over the next several years in the Lower 48 [U.S. states]," Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., the largest producer in the Permian, told investors in August.
Alaskan oil production is also in sharp retreat. Many of the largest Western oil companies have pulled back from Alaska, including BP PLC, which sold its North Slope properties to closely held Hilcorp Energy in 2020 for $5.6 billion.
Last year, production in Alaska fell to an average of 448,000 barrels a day, a 20-year-low, according to the EIA. Though vast reserves of untapped oil and gas remain in the state, a combination of forces are constraining investment. One of the most significant is a lack of financing. Under pressure from environmental groups, the six largest U.S. banks have pledged in recent years not to finance additional Arctic drilling.
Wildcatter Bill Armstrong, founder of Armstrong Oil & Gas Inc., which made one the largest oil finds in U.S. history in the North Slope in 2013, argues that as long as crude demand remains strong, investors' pullback from Alaska will only result in development in countries with less stringent regulations.
Mr. Armstrong sold his interest in the find, known as the Pikka unit, to Oil Search Ltd. for $850 million. The company, which agreed to merge with Australia's Santos Ltd. in August, has said it had trouble lining up bank financing and is years away from production.
"It's just been sitting there," Mr. Armstrong said of the discovery. "It's like its own OPEC country once it gets online. But we kind of need it now."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Democrats still tussling over how to scale back their ambitions to expand the country's social benefits and overhaul its climate-change policy face dwindling time to reach an agreement as both the House and Senate return to Washington this week.
One major element related to climate change -- a $150 billion program aimed at pushing utilities to draw more power from clean-energy sources -- could be cut from the bill, according to people familiar with the negotiations, as it has drawn objections from the centrist Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
Mired in internal policy disagreements, Democrats early this month passed a short-term extension of highway funding until the end of October, setting up a new deadline for much of President Biden's legislative agenda. While passing Democrats' marquee package -- a broad expansion of healthcare, education and climate programs, among other things -- won't be feasible by month's end, the timing has renewed pressure on Democrats to reach a rough consensus regarding its parameters.
Liberal Democrats have linked passage of a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package that has already cleared the Senate to the social-policy and climate package still under discussion in both chambers and at the White House.
The process of whittling down a package that Democratic leaders had initially pegged at roughly $3.5 trillion to a sum that centrist Democrats can support has stretched on as lawmakers debate which programs could be dropped, pared back or shortened in duration.
"I'm convinced we're going to get it done," Mr. Biden said during a speech in Hartford, Conn., on Friday. "We're not going to get $3.5 trillion. We'll get less than that, but we're going to get it. And we're going to come back and get the rest."
The proposed benefits for families with children, including subsidized child care, an extension of an expanded child tax credit and universal prekindergarten for 3- and 4-year-old children, are tangled up in the broader fight within Congress. In his remarks Friday, Mr. Biden also expressed doubts about whether the final package would include all of the funding he wanted for community colleges.
Democrats plan to advance the social-policy package through a process that allows them to skirt GOP opposition in the Senate and pass it with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes most bills need. In the evenly divided Senate, that has given the centrist Sens. Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona leverage to insist on less spending and other policy changes.
Mr. Manchin's objections to a central plank of the package's climate plan remain a major point of contention. Last month he said he would insist on preserving fossil-fuel subsidies and avoiding penalties for coal, gas and oil. Crucially, he has opposed a centerpiece of the package's climate measures, the clean-electricity performance program. As drafted in the House, it would provide grants to utilities that increase the amount of clean electricity they generate by at least 4% a year, while penalizing utilities that don't meet that standard.
Asked on CNN on Sunday about Mr. Manchin's objections, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the Biden administration remains committed to climate action. "Exactly what legislative form that takes is what's being negotiated right now," Mr. Buttigieg said.
Concerns from Ms. Sinema, Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.) and a handful of centrist House Democrats have complicated one of the package's most-popular provisions: allowing Medicare to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of prescription drugs.
The push is central to the package overall because it raises hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government that lawmakers hope to tap to pay for other healthcare programs. Paring it back could force Democrats to scale down some of their other plans to broaden Medicaid coverage, extend beefed-up Affordable Care Act subsidies and expand Medicare benefits to include dental, hearing and vision.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Calling climate change a systemic risk to the financial system, the White House released a report Friday outlining its strategy for new rules that could affect investment disclosures, insurance policies and home loans.
The report outlines administration goals, including forcing financial firms to more directly address the risks of climate change, creating new protections for savings and pension plans, and making climate change more a factor in federal budgeting and procurement.
Among the measures highlighted by the report was a proposal by the Labor Department on Wednesday to reverse a Trump administration rule that would have made it harder for workplace 401(k) plans to offer investments based on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, metrics.
"U.S. financial markets and institutions face systemic risks from climate change," the report said, saying the U.S. needs "a road map for measuring, disclosing, managing, and mitigating climate-related financial risk across the economy."
The report, ordered by President Biden, largely summarizes initiatives already under way by U.S. financial regulators and ties them into a set of core goals. The administration is attempting to show progress in fighting climate change before Mr. Biden heads to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12.
Larger efforts are stalled in Congress. Among other disagreements, Democrats there continue to haggle over whether to include a carbon tax in the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill.
Many economists and business executives say a carbon tax would be more effective than financial regulation at engineering a shift away from fossil fuels. But Mr. Biden and other Democrats have adopted priorities from environmentalists who have said the government should push Wall Street firms to take action on climate change and more directly account for it in their operations.
Opponents, including many Republicans, say that fighting climate change falls largely outside the scope of financial regulation.
White House officials say their efforts face a lengthy road ahead. However, they are also making the case that consumers need to be protected from wildfires, floods and other events linked to extreme weather that could threaten U.S. assets and investments, including $12 trillion in private retirement savings and pension accounts.
"This road map isn't about protecting our financial system. It's about protecting people, their paychecks and their prosperity," Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate adviser, said in a call with reporters.
The report comes as part of a White House effort to review climate risks both inside and outside government. In May, Mr. Biden told administration leaders to assess what financial risks climate change posed to federal programs and the stability of the U.S. government and what new steps they might need to take to protect the financial system and its consumers.
Major U.S. law firms said the process is laying a foundation for climate change-related regulations that the administration would apply to banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions.
Friday's report explains many of the efforts that are under way. Those include the consideration of new rules to expand access to insurance and of standards for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other agencies for factoring climate risks into loans they underwrite.

Full text: The world's governments are unlikely to prevent dangerous climate change even if the lofty pledges lawmakers and business have laid out in recent months are successfully implemented, the International Energy Agency said.
Whether lawmakers continue with policy measures already in place or follow through on their latest promises, rising temperatures will exceed the limit global leaders committed to in the Paris Agreement of keeping overall global temperatures to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the IEA said.
A month after President Biden said the U.S. and European Union would work to slash global methane emissions -- and weeks before delegates from around the world convene for United Nations-led climate negotiations in Glasgow -- the IEA laid out several long-term energy scenarios. The agency estimated the pledges announced by governments cover less than a fifth of the emissions the world must cut by 2030 if it is to remain capable of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
"Reaching that path requires investment in clean-energy projects and infrastructure to more than triple over the next decade," said Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA.
Efforts to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels haven't been without success, the IEA said. It said China's recent decision to end its support for foreign coal-fired power plants might prevent the emission of as much as 20 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide -- roughly the same amount that would be saved by the European Union hitting its target of net-zero emissions by 2050.
Even so, politicians and business leaders aren't investing enough in energy supply, said the IEA.
Relatively low natural-gas inventories and low wind levels in Europe have coincided with the post-pandemic economic recovery, a coal shortage in China and the prospect of a cold Northern Hemisphere winter to send fossil-fuel prices soaring. Brent crude oil prices have risen around 60% this year, while European benchmark gas prices are up more than 150% from their level three months ago.

Full text: LONDON -- The U.K. called on countries including India and China to update their plans to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, ratcheting up pressure on a handful of states as preparations for a United Nations climate summit in Glasgow accelerate.
With less than three weeks to go before the start of the high-profile conference -- and uncertainty about how committed several key participants are to a meaningful deal -- the stakes are growing for London, Washington and Brussels.
A key foundation of the talks, aimed at limiting global warming, is individual countries' own technical plans to cut emissions. Several major economies including the U.K., the U.S. and the EU recently have updated their plans to pivot from fossil fuels. Some major polluters, including China and India, haven't yet made public their own fresh commitments.
Other countries, such as Australia, Indonesia and South Africa, have updated climate targets or are considering revisions, though some environmental groups are concerned policy makers aren't moving fast enough. In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has moved to give priority to fossil fuel on the national grid over renewable energy sources, which environmentalists say will hurt Mexico's emission-reduction goals.
Alok Sharma, the U.K. climate envoy who is organizing the summit that is known as COP26, has in recent months tried to publicly cajole participants to work to bridge still-large gaps in positions ahead of the two-week meeting.
On many issues the parties "are still some way off consensus," Mr. Sharma said Tuesday. "It will be a challenging task to get us over the line."
Mr. Sharma said responses from the world's biggest economies "will quite simply be make or break" for the success of the summit, citing specifically the Group of 20 industrialized countries, which includes China and India. Those still holding out "must deliver," he said.
China and India are among those that have yet to set out their latest plans. In China, the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter but also the world's most populous country, President Xi Jinping pledged to bring the country's carbon peak from "around" to "before" 2030, and for China to achieve net-zero emissions before 2060. China hasn't officially presented plans to the U.N.
A spokesman for India's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change declined to comment. A senior Indian government official said India was on track to meet its climate goals, and has an ambitious renewable-energy goals.
The Glasgow summit is aimed at sustaining momentum for the Paris agreement, an accord struck in 2015 that calls for governments to limit the rise in global temperatures to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial days. A recent U.N. report said the Earth is expected to be about 2.7 degrees Celsius warmer by the end of this century, due in part, most scientists agree, to so-called greenhouse-gas emissions from industrial activities such as burning fossil fuels.

Full text: LONDON -- A United Nations committee said it couldn't rule on a complaint filed by young climate activists, including Greta Thunberg, which alleged five nations were violating children's rights by failing to adequately fight climate change.
In 2019, Ms. Thunberg and 14 other children sent a complaint to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child stating that France, Brazil, Argentina, Germany and Turkey weren't doing enough to combat climate change or upholding their obligations under international human-rights law.
On Monday, the U.N. committee said the 15 children should file their claims via national courts first.
The law firms representing the activists, Hausfeld and Earthjustice, called the decision "stunning."
The authors of the complaint had argued that the five nations' failed to keep their promise in the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
The activists' lawyers wrote in 2019 to the U.N. committee that the nations were violating the Convention on the Rights of the Child by denying their right to life, health and culture.

Full text: KAJAKI, Afghanistan -- Afghan farmer Niamatullah survived nearly two decades of conflict, growing beans, wheat and corn in Helmand province as war raged around him. When he finally decided to uproot his family and flee last month, it was because of the weather.
One of the worst droughts in decades in Afghanistan parched the fields of the 38-year-old, who goes by a single name, leaving his crops withered and worthless. He felt he had no choice but to pack his 15-member extended family into a rented truck and head out to search for day labor somewhere less desperate.
"Our children are crying because there is nothing to eat," Niamatullah said.
This year's deep drought is compounding the economic crisis that deepened when the Taliban overthrew the previous Afghan government, prompting the U.S. and others to freeze some $9 billion in Afghan central-bank assets and spurring a large number of the country's professionals to leave.
Now the scarcity of water is slashing farmers' incomes and driving up food bills for people in cities. The United Nations estimates that the drought is threatening the livelihood of up to nine million Afghans and affecting 25 of the country's 34 provinces.
Tough conditions have already put 14 million people -- more than one-third of the Afghan population -- in a food-security crisis, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Afghanistan's current harvest is expected to be 15% below average due to the drought, the FAO said.
"This is the worst drought in 35-36 years," said Richard Trenchard, the country director for FAO in Afghanistan. "Many public institutions, which provide a public safety net, have ceased to function," after the Taliban takeover, he said. "Farmers have very little to fall back on."
Afghanistan is heavily reliant on livelihoods sensitive to fluctuations in weather, such as rain-fed agriculture and cattle farming. Impoverished villagers often lack the capital and technology to switch to more modern and resilient farming methods. Climate change stands to increase the burden.
Around 12% of Afghanistan's land is suitable for agriculture, but around 80% of the population relies on farming for survival, said Samim Hoshmand, a former top climate negotiator under Afghanistan's National Environment Protection Agency.
"If the drought continues, and political instability continues, the future will be a disaster," Mr. Hoshmand said.
Afghanistan's new Taliban government has presented no plan for how to create jobs or provide support for a population that is sinking deeper into poverty. Anger over economic hardship could boil over into unrest, Afghan farmers said.
"We will wait for six months. If things don't get better, we will stand against the Taliban," said Mohammad Amir, a 45-year-old farmer from Dasht-e-Top, an arid plain in Wardak province west of Kabul. The area used to be famous for its sweet, crisp apples -- but has dried up. A wide riverbed running along the highway bears no trace of water. Farmers said they haven't seen snow in 20 years.
Drought affects more than just agriculture. The Kajaki Dam in Helmand was built in the 1950s as part of a U.S. initiative modeled on the Tennessee Valley Authority to counter Soviet influence in Afghanistan through development work.
The Helmand Valley Authority, as it was called, was intended to boost irrigation and agricultural land development along the Helmand and Arghandab rivers. The U.S. later turned Kajaki into a hydroelectric power station in the 1970s, a project that was suspended with the Soviet invasion of 1979.
In 2004, the U.S. restarted the project and refurbished two turbines in a bid to bring power to southern Afghanistan and edge out the Taliban with the allure of government-backed development. In 2008, thousands of mostly British troops hauled pieces for a third, 220-ton turbine on trucks across some of the most dangerous terrain in the country, but the equipment sat unassembled for a decade until it was finally installed in 2019.
Now, due to low water levels, Kajaki produces 6 megawatts of electricity, far short of its capacity of 51 megawatts, according to Tufan Ozcag, program manager of the Turkish 77 Insaat construction company, which leads refurbishment at Kajaki.
Water scarcity has in the past led to conflict with neighboring Iran, which receives water from the Helmand River after it flows through the sluices at Kajaki and across the border.
Climate change could "reduce the flow of critical fresh water across Afghanistan's borders, potentially raising tensions with its neighbors," said Oli Brown, senior research associate with Adelphi, a Berlin-based environmental think tank, and author of a climate risk brief on Afghanistan. It could also accelerate migration, he said, "and it could encourage farmers in some areas to grow poppy." Opium poppies require less water to cultivate than most other crops and can be more lucrative.
In Wardak province's Dasht-e-Top, farmers complained they don't have wells, and only a few prosperous farmers can afford solar panels to power irrigation.
On one of those solar-panel powered farms, Rahima Wardak's son now picks tomatoes for $3 a day, which constitutes the family's only income. Ms. Wardak, in her 50s, said she and her husband used to grow potatoes, onions and carrots on their own land, but their fields are now dried up.
"How can our sons be farmers? They will have to find something else to do," said Mohammad Omar Jalalzai, Ms. Wardak's 70-year-old husband, as he stood among his withering apricot trees.

Corrections & Amplifications

The 77 Insaat construction company is building a new 100-megawatt power plant in Kajaki, Afghanistan, to expand the current 50-megawatt facility. A Page One article on Monday about drought in Afghanistan described the company's work at Kajaki as solely refurbishment. Separately, a third turbine was installed at Kajaki hydroelectric power station in 2016. The article incorrectly said 2019.

Full text: Bernie Sanders has pushed Congress for decades to expand the social safety net and fight climate change, with limited success. Now, with Democrats on the brink of finalizing such a package, the Vermont senator must decide how much is enough.
The party is in negotiations over winnowing down a $3.5 trillion education, healthcare, child-care and climate plan, after Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona balked at the initial price tag. They are negotiating with the White House and Democratic leadership to find a compromise on which programs to fund and for how long, a process that has prompted increasing frustration from Mr. Sanders.
Last week, the self-described Democratic socialist held two media events and stepped up his criticism of Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema. He told reporters that the centrists needed to be clear about what they wanted -- and that the entire party shouldn't have to move all the way to them.
"I am delighted that the Democratic caucus and the president are prepared to think big and not small," Mr. Sanders said in an interview. Of the centrists, he said:"They have a right to fight for their ideas, they have a right to get concessions for their ideas, as does every other member of the caucus, but it does seem to me to be basically unfair and undemocratic for two people to say it's my way or the highway."
Mr. Manchin has said he would like to see the package cost $1.5 trillion, while Ms. Sinema hasn't shared any number publicly. President Biden has begun floating a roughly $2 trillion level as a compromise.
Democrats are using a special budget maneuver to pass the legislation without any Republican support, but they need all 50 lawmakers to remain on board. Much of the party's focus has been on winning over Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema, but Mr. Sanders must also decide what he is willing to accept and how hard he will push for it. So far, he says that number is still $3.5 trillion.
As Mr. Sanders says he is holding firm, other liberals are acknowledging the need to accept less. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) who chairs a group of House progressives, told Mr. Biden a package needed to be at least $2.5 trillion.
"At some point, all 50 of us are going to have to vote on the bill," said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D., Hawaii).
Mr. Sanders, an independent, was once on the fringe of the Democratic caucus. But his two runs for president popularized within the party a larger role for government in the economy, paid for by higher taxes on wealthy households and big business. While some signature goals, such as a Medicare for All healthcare system, remain sidelined, the current Democratic proposal has embraced or moved toward other of his ideas, including free preschool and subsidized child care, more-affordable housing and provisions to mitigate climate change.
To fund the programs, Democrats say they plan to raise taxes on corporations, investors and high-income business owners, with the size of the tax increases potentially being scaled back if the spending plans are narrowed. Mr. Sanders and Democrats have said they expect new revenue to cover the full price of the package.
No Republicans are expected to vote for the package, whatever its eventual size.
"This is a 50-50 body," said Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) on the Senate floor. "And yet Democrats have interpreted this incredibly close election as a mandate to radically transform this country," calling their spending plan the "Bernie Sanders socialist budget."
Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), a liberal who is close to Mr. Sanders, said Messrs. Sanders and Manchin need to engage in direct talks. If they can agree, Mr. Khanna said, the rest of the Democratic Party will follow.
"He's the standard bearer of the progressive movement. Once he signs off on something, every progressive in the House will vote for it," Mr. Khanna said about Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Sanders has declined to say if he has been talking to Mr. Manchin or Ms. Sinema. When he was asked by a reporter Friday if it made sense to just get in a room with the centrists to hash out a deal, he quipped: "It's not a movie."
A spokesman for Ms. Sinema declined a request for comment.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Manchin pointed the Journal to a statement Mr. Manchin had made last week after Mr. Sanders criticized him in a news conference.
"As he and I have discussed, Sen. Sanders believes America should be moving towards an entitlement society while I believe we should have a compassionate and rewarding society," Mr. Manchin said in his statement.

Full text: A top Federal Reserve official said financial regulators should direct the biggest U.S. banks to take new steps to manage climate-related risks as part of a broader effort to monitor potential hazards posed to the financial system.
Fed governor Lael Brainard detailed how the central bank is preparing to beef up its assessment of growing threats from climate-related events, including natural disasters and wildfires, which could deliver unexpected shocks to the economy and markets.
"Ultimately, I anticipate it will be helpful to provide supervisory guidance for large banking institutions in their efforts to appropriately measure, monitor and manage material climate-related risks," she said in virtual remarks at a conference Thursday on banking supervision hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Ms. Brainard's remarks are notable in part because she is seen as a potential candidate to become the Fed's vice chairman of bank supervision. Ms. Brainard is also a potential candidate to succeed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
"Climate change could have profound consequences for the level, trend growth and variability of economic activity over time," Ms. Brainard said. The pandemic "is a stark reminder that extreme events can materialize with little warning and trigger severe losses and market disruptions," she said.
Ms. Brainard said the Fed is examining ways to incorporate so-called scenario analysis to account for both the physical risks of climate change and the costs associated with any transition to a lower-carbon-footprint economy. Natural disasters and government policy actions "could quickly alter perceptions of future risk or reveal new information about the value of assets," she said.

Full text: Alphabet Inc.'s Google will no longer allow digital ads bought on its platform to appear next to online content that denies climate change, a ban that will also apply to YouTube, the company's giant online-video service.
The ban applies to "content that contradicts the well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change," Google, the world's largest digital-ad company by revenue, said in a blog post Thursday. It also applies to any content denying that human activity or greenhouse-gas emissions contribute to climate change.
Google's move aims to cut off a major source of income for providers of climate-change misinformation. Google's $147 billion in ad revenue comes from selling ad space in its own products, such as YouTube, as well as from brokering ad sales on thousands of sites across the web.
A spokesman for Google said the company would use a "combination of automated tools and human review" to enforce its policy.
Google is the leading provider of tools used in the many steps of purchasing and selling online ads -- whether they are meant to run on Google's own platforms or sites around the web. Google is expected to take 29% of global digital-ad spending in 2021, according to research firm eMarketer.
For several years, Google has prohibited advertising on certain content that is deemed misleading to the public or unattractive to advertisers, including civic disinformation, disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic and some content featuring minors.
Critics have said Google's enforcement has been lax and ineffective at restraining the spread of disinformation.

Full text: YAKUTSK, Russia -- Thawing earth once thought to be permanently frozen is springing to life and threatening a crucial chunk of Russia's economy.
The melting of the thick layer of the earth known as permafrost is a result of climate change, according to scientists and research from Russia's government. Two-thirds of the country sits on such soil, including much of its oil and gas infrastructure. Since 1976, Russia's average temperature has risen 0.92 degree Fahrenheit per decade, or 2 1/2 times the global pace, government data shows.
Mines and plants are experiencing increasing corrosion leaks and cracks, stemming in large part from defrosting ground. In the pipeline industry, braces and other mechanisms, previously anchored into permafrost, often corrode, twist and bend when the earth below changes, according to ecologists and other researchers. Companies are pouring millions of dollars into reinforcing buildings, monitoring soil temperatures and installing high-tech cooling systems.
The phenomenon was a contributor to the largest ever spill in the polar Arctic in spring 2020, when damage to a diesel fuel storage tank in remote Siberia caused 20,000 tons of fuel to leak.
After the spill, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a national state of emergency and the country's prosecutor general ordered regional prosecutors to inspect all hazardous facilities built on permafrost. Russia's Investigative Committee, the nation's main investigations agency, later blamed the incident on negligence and poor maintenance. Officials at the Norilsk Nickel mining company that operates the installation -- along with some government scientists and elected officials -- said thawing permafrost caused the failure of posts supporting the basement where the storage tank laid.
"In the near past, everybody believed that permafrost would have an impact on infrastructure by the end of the century. Now we know we don't have much time," said Vladimir Romanovsky, professor of geophysics at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. "Oil, gas, villages -- it's all on the line."
Russian economic officials and scientists estimate that thawing permafrost could affect more than a fifth of Russian infrastructure. The economy stands to lose more than $68 billion by 2050, a government minister said in May. The government says that 40% of buildings and infrastructure facilities in permafrost-covered areas have already been damaged.
Aging Russian buildings and equipment, much dating to the Cold War, don't help matters. "We must be prepared for this," said Mr. Putin during a nationwide address in June. Last month, he ordered the creation of a national permafrost monitoring system to analyze data from 140 stations.
In Yakutsk, capital of the Northeast region of Yakutia, residents describe water pipes that regularly burst, creating fissures and holes in buildings. Roads buckle as moisture seeps in from below, leading to cracks in the asphalt. Trains run at slower speeds because of deformed tracks, local engineers said. Flooding was behind the resettlement of at least one waterlogged village from the basin of the remote Kolyma River.
Across the countryside, the effect of permafrost is plain to see. Thawing ice has transformed farmland into swamps and rivers swell in springtime with up to 30% more runoff compared with the 1980s, local scientists said. In villages, locals who previously stored meat and other perishables in cellars dug deep into the ground now must use ordinary deep freezers because of waterlogged subsoil.
For funerals, residents for centuries had to dig to approximately 5 feet underground, and then burn wood to heat the soil to suitable softness required to bury the dead. These days, there is no need for the second step, said local ecologist Valentina Dmitriyeva.
Permafrost, so named because it is a permanently frozen thick layer under the earth's surface, consists of soil, rock or sediment that usually remains below freezing for more than two years. It can be found near dry land and under the ocean floor, anywhere from an inch to several miles beneath the surface. It is most common in historically frigid places such as Russia, the Alps and China's mountainous regions.
The softening of the soil is both a result of global warming, and emits gases that contribute to it, according to the U.S. Environment Protection Agency. As permafrost thaws, the remains of plants and other organic material decompose, releasing methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the EPA says, exacerbating the matter.
In some areas, thawing ground can give way to craters. Scientists say the likely reason is the steady buildup of underground gases able to burst through soft upper permafrost layers.
In Alaska, the top layer of permafrost at the northern sensor site of Deadhorse has warmed by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit per decade since the late 1970s, according to U.S. statistics. Foundations of Alaskan homes have been unsettled while highways and railroad tracks require repair due to cracking, heaving and sinking. Canada's northern Arctic has experienced damage to homes, roads, indigenous cultural sites and the marine environment.
For some of Russia's biggest businesses, adjustments for permafrost are already under way.
Alrosa, one of the world's largest diamond producers, has 82% of its reserves in permafrost areas, according to Morgan Stanley. The company says it has added "freezing columns" to its mines; the columns connect to refrigeration stations on the surface and shoot coolant dozens of feet beneath the ground to firm up the earth.
Alrosa has what it calls a Permafrost Surveillance Unit in Siberia to monitor the soil temperature in 4,800 wells. Another miner, PAO Severstal, says it is building structures on stilts, to better adapt to shifting ground.
For oil-and-gas companies, permafrost interferes with both the extraction of resources and subsequent transport.
Around 90% of the gas production of state-controlled energy giant PAO Gazprom is located in permafrost-covered provinces, according to Morgan Stanley. At its Bovanenkovskoye field, a vast facility in Northern Russia that Gazprom hopes will last for another century, the company has installed 1,000 vapor-liquid cooling units, a system of underground pipes to circulate a refrigerant compound and ensure the ground stays frozen.
Alexander Sobul, a professional diver and underwater repairman for pipeline infrastructure in Yakutia for four decades, said he's noticed increased cracking and deformation during his dives. He blames the loosening of previously dense soil surrounding pipelines. "The welding doesn't hold up," Mr. Sobul says.
Morgan Stanley researchers say melting permafrost and related infrastructure degradation could harm Russia's credit profile. The oil-and-gas sector contributes as much as one-fifth of the nation's gross domestic product, while fuel and energy products make up the majority of Russia's exports.
"You can see that the companies take it very seriously," said Willem Visser, a credit analyst at asset manager T. Rowe Price. Mr. Visser has added metrics of permafrost risk to his analyses of Russian energy companies.
The effects are particularly acute in Yakutia, the vast northeast Russia area of 1.2 million square miles, five times the size of France. Yakutia's capital of Yakutsk is the coldest constantly inhabited city in the world; temperatures fall to below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit for at least three months each year. The region this summer made headlines for out-of-control wildfires that further thawed the soil, scientists say.
Commodity extraction is a key part of the Yakutia economy. The $55 billion Power of Siberia pipeline, a strategically crucial project that delivers Russian natural gas to China, largely carries gas found in Yakutia fields.
When the first crack appeared in the ceiling of her weatherworn Yakutsk apartment, Larisa Tikhonova paid it little mind.
Shortly after, the cracks multiplied, spreading across newly formed crevices on the wall of her 1950s-era kitchen. Later, a stench rose from standing water under the four-story building. Ms. Tikhonova and her neighbors called emergency services, and even sued the government of this city of 300,000 in remote northeast Siberia, but no help came. She has been waiting for 11 years.
Other locals say they too are accustomed to hearing groans or pops as buildings lean and walls crack. Fewer than three dozen of Yakutsk's 2,000 concrete apartment buildings were deemed safe when tested roughly 10 years ago, the ecologist Ms. Dmitriyeva said, and few repairs have been made since.
Segments of the city's buildings collapsed in 2010, 2011, 2015 and last year.
On a walk earlier this year through Avtodorozhnaya Street, local construction engineer Eduard Romanov surveyed corrosion nibbling at the foundation of a two-story apartment building. In summer 2020, the building was marked as uninhabitable by local officials after a foot-wide fissure appeared on the front facade while residents were inside.
Security guard Eduard Kirillin was among them, sitting at his computer drinking tea in the apartment his parents owned, when he heard a loud cracking sound. Worried the roof had caved in, Mr. Kirillin ran into the street with other neighbors, only to discover the side of the building splitting apart.
"I remember earlier seeing water pipes leaking under the building," Mr. Kirillin said. "It was always wet under there. And the night before the accident, it was as though the building was shaking," he said.
Houses in Yakutsk could once safely be built on piles sunk 26 feet into frozen ground, Mr. Romanov said. Nowadays, they must be dug in at almost 40 feet.
Roughly 3 miles away on Lenina Street, in a corner apartment two floors above Ms. Tikhonova, Viktor Polyanichko's parents are surrounded by deterioration. Their apartment, Mr. Polyanichko said, "has big cracks everywhere. The doorway is skewed. And my parents say they can hear the beams cracking above."
Neither Mr. Polyanichko nor other residents could assign certain blame. The State Building and Housing Supervision Authority of Yakutia estimates that 99% of cracks in homes can be traced to poor building maintenance. "The most important thing is management," said Vlad Permyakov, the agency's first deputy head.
Local ecologists and scientists, as well as engineers such as Mr. Romanov, said thawing ground was a major factor. "Building basements is very difficult," said Valery Lepov, director of research-focused Larionov Institute of the Physical-Technical Problems of the North. "We can do this only in some places where there is not a lot of thawing."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden called on House Democrats to hold off on voting on a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill until after they reach agreement on a separate social-policy and climate measure, moving to again delay final passage of a central piece of his agenda in a bid to unify restive Democrats.
But even as he endorsed progressives' push to hold up a vote on the infrastructure bill, he acknowledged in a closed-door meeting with House Democrats Friday that the price tag of the social policy and climate measure would need to drop substantially below $3.5 trillion to closer to roughly $2 trillion, according to lawmakers and aides.
The infrastructure bill "ain't going to happen until we reach an agreement on the next piece of legislation," Mr. Biden told House Democrats, according to a person familiar with his remarks. Exiting the meeting, Mr. Biden told reporters: "It doesn't matter whether it's in six minutes, six days or six weeks. We're going to get it done."
The House took up a short-term extension of existing transportation programs, instead of the infrastructure bill, passing it 365-51 on Friday night.
The presidential visit to Capitol Hill appeared to defuse, at least temporarily, a standoff between the progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic party, who have feuded for weeks over Mr. Biden's agenda.
Progressives have threatened to block the infrastructure bill if it comes to the floor before Democrats have unified around the broader social policy package that includes education, healthcare and climate elements. Centrists have, in turn, demanded a vote on infrastructure and raised concerns about the price of the social policy and climate bill, including about its proposed tax increases.
"I think he sent two practical realities: one is that we have to get to an agreement on reconciliation and it's not going to be $3.5 [trillion] and two, that that's going to be necessary to get an infrastructure bill across the finish line," said Rep. Derek Kilmer (D., Wash.).
The fraught intraparty negotiations are a reflection of the very narrow majorities Democrats hold in Congress. Democrats can't afford a single defection in the 50-50 Senate, and they can no lose no more than three votes in the House, meaning leadership must build nearly unanimous consensus for the policies in the party.
They are pursuing a process called reconciliation to approve the social policy and climate bill without GOP support in the Senate, where legislation would otherwise require 60 votes to advance. Republicans have called the social policy proposal wasteful and potentially damaging to the economy.
Democrats had initially set the size at $3.5 trillion for the broader bill. Mr. Biden told House Democrats that negotiations with centrists would likely bring its cost in the range of roughly $2 trillion, according to lawmakers and aides. Lawmakers said Mr. Biden mentioned possible toplines from the bill ranging from $1.9 trillion to $2.3 trillion.
"Even a smaller bill can make historic investments," Mr. Biden told House Democrats, according to two people familiar with his remarks.
"He said what we all know is true, that $3.5 [trillion] has to come down," said Rep. Peter Welch (D., Vt.) "I was glad to hear him say this -- that we can make progress with a lower number."
Top Democrats and Mr. Biden spent much of the week scrambling to try to resolve the impasse. They held a series of meetings with centrist Democrats including Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, working to iron out a new framework for the social policy and climate bill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) twice delayed the vote on the infrastructure bill this week.
Mrs. Pelosi had targeted this week for the infrastructure vote as part of a previous agreement with centrist Democrats. Some of those centrists seemed resigned Friday evening to delaying it again, given Mr. Biden's stance.
"I wish we would have heard something else, but the president said that we got to get both of them done," said Rep. Henry Cuellar (D., Texas). "If we get it done, it'll be a victory. The question is, when do we get that victory."
While Mr. Biden effectively bought Democrats more time to resolve their differences with his remarks Friday, the party will still need to make difficult decisions about how to slim down their $3.5 trillion package before the infrastructure bill can go forward.
House Democrats have crafted a package that would expand Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing care; offer universal prekindergarten; provide two free years of community college; and create a program incentivizing utilities to reduce carbon emissions over time, among many other programs. Finding the cuts necessary to dramatically shrink the bill will likely be difficult.
Mr. Manchin has said he could support $1.5 trillion on the social policy and climate bill, while Ms. Sinema hasn't publicly declared what she would support. She was in Phoenix on Friday for a medical appointment and continued negotiations remotely, according to a spokesman.
Lawmakers said Mr. Biden told them that he had spent "tens of hours" talking with Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema and that he was pushing them to identify which programs they could back.
"He just basically has said that's what he has kept saying to them, 'Tell me what you're for -- don't talk about a number, tell me what policies you're for,'" House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D., Ky.) said.

Full text: WHITEHAVEN, England -- In a weed-strewn field on the edge of this harbor town, Britain's lofty climate-change ambitions are colliding with economic reality.
The last of the U.K.'s deep mines in this area closed in the 1980s and the nation that used coal to power the industrial revolution now uses very little for energy generation.
Then a few years ago, a new prospector set up shop in Whitehaven with a plan for the wasteland nearby: To sink Britain's first new deep coal pit in 30 years.
The ensuing fight over planning permission is pitting local politicians, who say it will generate jobs and provide a local source of coking coal to make steel, against environmentalists who say it will harm the environment. For the British government, it is an awkward side show as the U.K. prepares to host the United Nations COP26 climate-change conference that starts Oct. 31.
The U.K. has set ambitious climate-change targets and is urging other nations to do the same. It has drastically cut the share of electricity generated by coal, helping it to slash its carbon emissions. The Whitehaven mine doesn't directly represent a retreat from that push, as it would instead produce coal with special properties for use in steel making.
Still, environmental campaigners have held up the Whitehaven mine as an example of governments talking big on climate but failing to act. The British government has delayed the final decision on the mine until after the COP26 summit.
Chris Stark, the chief executive of the U.K.'s Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government on its climate targets, says approval of a new coal project "is clearly a wrong message." U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry is among others who have criticized the development.
Whitehaven's local politicians are exasperated. The faded pastel-colored buildings that make up the 17th-century town center are pockmarked with boarded-up shops. Most of the local good jobs are in a nuclear-decommissioning site. For the mayor, Mike Starkie, opening a mine would create 500 jobs and pull in some investment. He bristles at the international condemnation.
"We've got senators in America telling us we shouldn't be opening coal mines, while selling us their coal," he said, referring to Mr. Kerry. "In terms of climate change on a world-wide scale it doesn't even register. It's like one hair on a golden retriever."
In October, an independent planning inspector will visit the site where the new mine would be sunk.
The debate presents a conundrum for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose electoral success was built by wooing blue-collar votes in postindustrial towns with the promise of jobs and investment. Whitehaven sits in the district of Copeland, which switched to Mr. Johnson's Conservative Party in 2017 from the opposition Labour Party.
That year, West Cumbria Mining Ltd., which is backed by Australian private-equity group EMR Capital, applied for planning permission to exploit the coal off Whitehaven's coast. Three times, the local county council backed the plan. But following protests by environmental groups, the government intervened. A public inquiry is ongoing into the proposal and a government minister will make a final decision on the matter.
West Cumbria Mining says it would be a carbon-neutral mine, offsetting or capturing any carbon emitted from the mining process. In a submission to the public inquiry, the company said sourcing coal from the U.K. for British steel production is more environmentally friendly than shipping it from abroad. The mine would operate until 2049 and produce 65 million tons of metallurgical coal.
West Cumbria Mining said it expects a final government decision by March. A spokeswoman didn't comment further.
Environmentalists question the net-zero claim. South Lakes Action on Climate Change, a local group that is protesting against the mine, says it doesn't take into account the climate impact of burning the coal, just the emissions producing it.

Proposal Stirs
Hopes and Fears
There are scattered remains of coal's heyday in the town of Whitehaven on England's west coast. A disused blue mine head towering over a brick colliery on a hill above the town is the most prominent symbol.
Standing on the concrete shards that litter the site of a proposed new coal mine, 74-year-old former miner Dave Cradduck recalled the devastation of the pit closures in the 1980s. He hopes a new one will open soon.
"My brother has put his name down for a job there," he said. "And he is 67."
Several patrons at a Whitehaven harbor-front pub said they also want the mine, regardless of the climate implications. The barman said the only local people who want to stop the mine are those in wealthier parts of the neighboring Lake District.
Joseph Ghayouba, 33, who works at the local nuclear plant and is an elected councilor, said he has to back the mine, even if he has reservations, because of the dearth of other local employment opportunities.
"When the environmentalists say you can't have the mine because it is bad for the environment, I say 'what can we have?' and at the moment there isn't anything," he added.
Gaile Stevens, a 59-year-old resident, said she would rather see Whitehaven shift toward tourism. "Is a new coal mine the best we can do with a Georgian[-era] gem town?"

Full text: BERLIN -- Germany faces weeks and perhaps months of uncertainty after Sunday's election left open the shape and agenda of its next government open and offered no clarity about who would succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel.
This means the world's fourth-largest economy and the European Union's biggest member could find itself with a weakened government in the following four years.
The election that capped 16 years of conservative dominance under Ms. Merkel gave the chancellor's center-left political rivals a paper-thin majority, according to preliminary results, but whether they can succeed her and shift Europe's largest economy to the left will now depend on the outcome of complex and lengthy coalition negotiations.
Ms. Merkel will continue to rule in a caretaker capacity for now. Germany's allies in Europe and the U.S. will have to wait before the country is ready to discuss urgent issues including a European package of measures to combat climate change and how to approach an increasingly aggressive China.
Throughout her long tenure and partly because of her popularity at home and abroad, Ms. Merkel, who wasn't running on Sunday, grew to become one of the most experienced and most influential European leaders.
After the indecisive vote, her successor could find this influence reduced, with less support in Parliament and heading a fractious government made up of three coalition partners, a first in Germany's postwar history.
Preliminary results released by the ARD public broadcasters gave the center-left Social Democratic Party 25.8% of the votes against 24.1% for Ms. Merkel's conservatives. If these estimates hold, SPD candidate Olaf Scholz, now the finance minister in Ms. Merkel's government, would take the lead in trying to form the next government and become the likeliest candidate to become the next chancellor.
Yet such a razor-thin victory could complicate and lengthen the process of forming a coalition, casting doubts over the nation's future direction for weeks or even months.
"The citizens have decided to elevate the Social Democratic Party and that is a great success," Mr. Scholz said at his party headquarters after the release of the preliminary results. "So many people have voted SPD because they want the government to change, and they want the next chancellor to be Olaf Scholz."
Mr. Scholz's potential ascent to the chancellery now depends on his ability to put together a coalition. The shape of this coalition will, in turn, determine the government's policy agenda.
While Mr. Scholz, 63 years old, is a member of the current government and has stressed continuity in his election campaign, he has signaled some openness to allowing the European Union to spend and raise debt. Germany has traditionally opposed such a policy because it thinks only democratically elected parliaments should have a say in such matters and that such a construct would lead to overspending and overborrowing.
This could potentially be good news for proponents of giving the EU greater spending powers. Mr. Scholz has said in the past that he strives toward creating a much more united Europe.
Germany's relationship with the U.S. has cooled under Ms. Merkel, something that isn't expected to change under Mr. Scholz as chancellor.
Mr. Scholz has said he would like to preside over an alliance with the environmental Greens, and the Free Democrats or FDP, a pro-market party. Should he fail to forge a consensus, the two parties could also enter a coalition with the conservatives.
Armin Laschet, the conservative candidate, said he, too, would like to form a government, offering the Greens and the FDP in a postelection televised debate a possibility to "fulfill what they promised to their voters."
The coalition talks will determine the distribution of ministerial portfolios and the government's policy agenda, which can be highly detailed and would feature a mix of each party's priorities. A new government must win the support of a majority of parliamentarians, who would then elect the chancellor.
The prospects of weeks of negotiations is likely to cause consternation elsewhere in Europe. Germany's allies have been waiting for Berlin to weigh in on major pending projects such as a climate package and potential amendments to the bloc's debt and deficit rules.
The election could mean a weaker German leadership in the EU, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director with Euroasia Group, a political risk consultancy, because the new "chancellor will have to straddle a three-way coalition, and that will reflect on their leadership in Europe."
A bout of German introspection coupled with next year's election in France, the EU's second-largest economy, meant that any big initiatives would have to wait at least a year, he said.
If he does put together a coalition, Mr. Scholz is likely to push for more public investment, especially in climate transition and digital infrastructure.
More public investment in Europe's biggest economy would have a spillover effect on the rest of Europe as Germany would finally meet the demands for fiscal expansion that have become the mantra of international financial institutions.
Whatever the outcome, the result is a setback for the conservatives who saw their share of the vote drop around eight points from a historic low in 2017.
Mr. Scholz campaigned on a social-justice ticket focused on increasing the minimum wage, building affordable housing, increasing taxes for the upper-middle class and stabilizing the pay-as-you-go pension system.
The Greens have made their participation conditional on radically reducing the country's CO2 emissions and subsidizing a green transformation of the economy. They call for an annual stimulus for green subsidies of over 50 billion euros (equivalent to more than $58 billion) on top of existing public expenditure.
The FDP has vowed to prevent any tax increases and if Mr. Scholz opts for a coalition with them, it is likely that the government's social and climate agenda will rely more on borrowing from the markets.

Full text: From the Sept. 23 edition of Christian Whiton's Super Macro newsletter:
The fake science pushed on the public by the government and media has worked somewhat. A Pew poll last year indicated 62% of adults think climate change is affecting their local community. Gallup, exhibiting the trademark arrogance and refusal to countenance disagreement that mark the climate debate, said that 64% of adults "acknowledge the scientific consensus" that human activities cause climate change. On the other hand, a poll in 2019 revealed that 68% of Americans would not pay $10 more per month on their electricity bill to combat climate change. The same poll showed that if you lower that amount to $1, then 57% of the public would pony up. We see that the American public as usual knows better than the elites. The climate is changing as it always has and carbon emissions are something we should probably curb gradually through nuclear power, natural gas, and renewables, but there is no "crisis." Certainly raising the cost of energy, which would stunt human progress generally, is not the right answer.

Full text: GLASGOW, Scotland -- Anton Hicks worries world leaders at the big climate summit here in November will find it hard to agree on a plan of action.
"Perhaps they should listen to my anthem," says the amateur composer. "It's the only way anything will get done."
Mr. Hicks is vying to have his song, "With Earth's Grace," adopted as the meeting's official song by organizers of the 26th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, in Glasgow. But he has competition.
David Glasson, best known for his work with members of England's Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, a '60s-era group that mixed psychedelic pop with comedy, has high hopes for "Save the Earth," an anthem he wrote with John Gribbin. And there is a Scottish collective's "Enough Is Enough," and an international group collaboration called "Do It While You Can."
In recent years, anthems have moved beyond commemorating nations to saluting European soccer championships, Asian trade blocs, cities and companies. The United Nations Chilldren's Fund ordered one up. So did the North Atlantic Treaty Organization: "The NATO Hymn," written by a lieutenant colonel in the Luxembourg army, was formally adopted in 2018.
Tim Rice, Andrew Lloyd Webber's collaborator on musicals such as "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Evita," wrote a would-be anthem for the Group of Seven summit in Cornwall, England, this year, but the event didn't bite, and the schoolchildren rounded up to perform it sang it on their own.
Even Mars has an anthem: "Dare to dream! Dare to strive! Build a home for our children. Make this desert come alive." The Lakewood, Colo.-based Mars Society that commissioned says it rivals "La Marseillaise," the French national anthem.
Whether COP26 will adopt one, though, is far from certain. There is no formal anthem competition, despite the roster of competitors. Asked whether they intended to have an anthem, a representative of the organizers said they don't currently have plans for one. There are a lot of other issues to thinkabout, including getting enough Covid vaccines to delegates from the developing world so they can meet U.K. entry requirements, other officials said.
Mr. Hicks and his cohorts are undeterred.
Mr. Hicks, 60, a former psychiatric nurse who lives in London, spent $400 to hire a singer and arranger to improve the odds for his composition, which he says is loosely based on old spirituals. For another $275, he hired a Bangladeshi artist to create an animated video. Mr. Hicks posted it on YouTube, and it has attracted nearly 120,000 views.
Messages on his social-media pages have urged him on, including from religious and educational figures in the U.K. and elsewhere.
Mr. Hicks said he got through by phone to try to lobby a member of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, which is hosting the event. She apologized and quickly ended the conversation, he says. The official didn't respond to a request for comment. Other officials haven't responded to his calls or emails, he says.
"No one wants to know" about his anthem, Mr. Hicks says.
Mr. Glasson also is trying to increase his song's chances. His local school in Brighton, in the south of England, is working on a version of "Save the Earth," he says. "I certainly think we're in with a shout."
Mr. Hicks admits to having less musical know-how than the pros.
"Typically I just la-la-la the tunes, so it's a case of getting the singer to match what's in my head," he says. "Then I tell the arranger what I need, and we go from there."
This time, Mr. Hicks said he put pen to paper in a bid to inspire the different delegations at the summit to set aside their differences and make binding commitments to slow climate change.
"I'll respect you, as you will me," the song goes. "We'll fight but still be friends. That's our victory."
He turned to websites for freelancers, including Fiverr, to find singers and arrangers to produce a recorded version. "I went through six people on Fiverr before I could find the right person," he says.
The arranger he settled on, Ukrainian Boris Sevastyanov, "actually improved it," Mr. Hicks says. And the Tuscaloosa, Ala.-based singer, who uses the single name Nimiwari, "nailed it," he says.
As the clock ticks down to the November summit, and without a seal of approval from the organizers, Mr. Hicks acknowledges that his piece might have to serve as an unofficial call to arms.
"If that's the way it goes," he says, "I suppose I'll have to make do with that."

Italian Court Frees
Catalan Secessionist
An Italian court freed Catalan secessionist leader Carles Puigdemont, whom Spanish authorities accuse of sedition for his role in organizing an illegal independence referendum, a day after he was arrested late Thursday by police on the Italian island of Sardinia, his lawyer there said.
Mr. Puigdemont could face extradition to Spain and a potential trial for his role in Catalonia's illegal independence referendum in 2017.
The Italian court decided that a new hearing would be held Oct. 4 to decide whether Mr. Puigdemont will need to be extradited to Spain. Meanwhile, Mr. Puigdemont will be free to leave Italy, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Mr. Puigdemont, who is now a member of the European Parliament, was the regional president of Catalonia in October 2017, when his administration staged a referendum on secession from Spain. Spain's highest court declared the plebiscite illegal, leading to criminal charges against a number of Catalan leaders.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez recently restarted talks with the Catalan regional government headed by Pere Aragones to discuss the region's demands.

CHINA
Airlift to Islands
Draws Hanoi Rebuke
An air transport mission by China's military to island bases in the South China Sea has drawn a rebuke from Vietnam and raised concerns among security experts that Beijing is trying to normalize its activities in the disputed waters.
The Chinese navy's South Sea Fleet publicized the maneuver -- which used three airstrips on artificial islands that China built atop small reefs in recent years -- on an official social-media account last week.
The disclosure of the mission marks China's first known public acknowledgment that the bases have been used to accommodate large aircraft. China's move demonstrates that the bases can support major operations, including movements by transport aircraft that potentially can carry weapons systems as well as smaller bomber models.
The airstrips are located in the Spratlys, an archipelago of small islands and atolls, parts or all of which are claimed by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. A tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled in 2016 that China's claims to features in the Spratlys and other parts of the sea were legally baseless. Beijing rejected the ruling.

GERMANY
'Climate Strike' Held
Across the World
Tens of thousands of environmental activists staged a rally outside Germany's parliament Friday, two days before the country holds a national election, to demand that politicians take stronger action to curb climate change.
The protest outside the Reichstag in Berlin was part of a string of rallies around the world -- amid dire warnings that the planet faces dangerous temperature rises unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut sharply in coming years. Across Germany alone, hundreds of thousands of marchers joined similar protests in several cities and towns.
The idea for a global "climate strike" was inspired by teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg's solo protest in Stockholm three years ago. It snowballed into a mass movement until the coronavirus pandemic put a stop to large gatherings. Activists have only recently started staging smaller protests again.
Ms. Thunberg, 18, addressed the Berlin rally from a stage, telling the crowd that voting is important but must be coupled with protests that put politicians under constant pressure.
"We can still turn this around," she said, to cheers. "We demand change, and we are the change."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency is completing new rules to reduce the use of coolants in air conditioners and refrigerators that are potent greenhouse gases.
The rules create a process for reducing the use of hydrofluorocarbons in cooling appliances, the first step toward meeting new mandates to cut their supply by 85% over 15 years, the EPA said. Congress passed with bipartisan support that mandate in December in provisions included in a $2 trillion spending and Covid-19 aid package.
The EPA formally proposed the rules required under the law in May. Thursday's moves complete that process to make the rules final.
The rules would cut the equivalent of 4.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from 2022 through 2050, or almost three years of U.S. power-sector emissions at 2019 levels, the EPA said. That is down slightly from the May proposal, which estimated a reduction of 4.7 billion metric tons.
Biden administration officials didn't detail changes from that proposal in a call with reporters. Agency Administrator Michael Regan said the agency's review of public comments since the proposal was made strengthened the final rule, but he didn't elaborate.
"It sends a signal to the rest of the world we are in, we are all in on climate change," said Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate adviser.
The agency also downgraded how much it expected the rules to benefit the economy to $272 billion through 2050. In May it had estimated $284 billion in net benefits, including reduced compliance costs for the industry and public spending to deal with the consequences of climate change.
The rules have wide support from industry, largely from U.S. chemical makers that have spent billions of dollars developing alternative coolants to sell globally, and from retailers looking to reduce theircontribution to climate change.
But there are concerns about the quality and availability of compliant new coolant chemicals, with some suppliers and customers warning that prices could rise if the new rules get ahead of developing technology.
The industry group Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy has said consumer prices for appliances might eventually rise as much as about 2%, comparable to previous coolant phaseouts.
The phasedown is consistent with the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, an international agreement to phase out hydrofluorocarbons. President Biden still intends to seek Senate ratification for the treaty, Ms. McCarthy said, but she added that she had no timetable for that effort.
The new rules being completed on Thursday are an early step under the law passed last year, setting only the outlines of the program and how to enforce it. They will include defined limits for the consumers of these chemicals by Oct. 1, and create a system for companies that might exceed the limits or have a surplus to trade with one another to stay in compliance.

Full text: Some big oil companies say they want to play a key role in reducing carbon emissions, but they are set to be sidelined at the United Nations climate conference.
Retailers, tech companies and consumer products makers have all been named as "principal partners" for COP26 in Glasgow -- allowing them greater involvement with the event -- but major oil companies like BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC will have a lower profile. That is because the oil industry has yet to agree on science-based plans for how it will reduce carbon emissions, a hurdle U.K. organizers set as a prerequisite for involvement in the event.
Companies that haven't set out credible emissions-reduction plans, as determined by a U.N.-backed third party, are unable to sponsor the event, run workshops and panel discussions, or book exhibition space in areas managed by the U.K. government.
"The COP26 Presidency is working most closely with organizations that are committed to taking real, positive action and have strong climate credentials," a COP26 spokesman said. COP, which stands for conference of the parties, is the U.N.'s flagship annual climate event, and this year the U.K. is in charge of organizing it as the host country.
While the main focus of the meeting, which starts in Glasgow on Oct. 31, will be climate negotiations between governments, businesses have sought to engage with the event as they see both the risks and commercial opportunities of climate change.
Fossil-fuel companies have sometimes sponsored previous COP meetings, particularly when hosted in their home country, but their association drew criticism from environmental groups.
Officials at BP and Shell, which are both listed in London and have a large presence in the U.K., are disappointed at being sidelined at the event, people familiar with the matter said. Both companies had hoped to be involved, the people said, having set out plans to pivot away from oil and gas and invest more in low-carbon energy.
Oil companies still plan to send staff to COP and BP said Chief Executive Bernard Looney plans to attend.
To participate in the event, the U.K. organizers required large companies to have carbon-reduction targets in line with the latest climate science on how much and how quickly they need to reduce their emissions. The Science Based Targets initiative, a partnership between the U.N. Global Compact and other nonprofit organizations, decides whether or not those plans are credible. Alternatively, companies could sign up for the U.N.-backed Race to Zero campaign, which requires science-based emissions-reduction targets.
Other energy companies, like utilities SSE PLC and ScottishPower, which is owned by Iberdrola SA, are sponsoring COP26 after their emissions-reduction plans were ratified by the SBTi.
"I've not heard of any COP previously restricting who can participate by requiring a science-based commitment," said Dirk Forrister, chief executive of the International Emissions Trading Association, of which BP and Shell are members. "I think the U.K. government is definitely trying to send a message that the fossil fuel industry is under the gun to lead the energy transition and set targets for how they will do that."

Full text: President Biden outlined a U.S. foreign-policy vision rooted in global alliances during his first address to the United Nations as commander in chief, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy at a moment when relations with some U.S. allies are strained.
Mr. Biden called for a shift away from armed conflict after two decades of war in Afghanistan and the Middle East. "As we close this period of relentless war, we're opening a new era of relentless diplomacy," he said.
The president made the case that the biggest issues facing the world -- from the coronavirus pandemic to climate change -- can only be solved with cooperation among countries with different national interests. The world, he said, is facing an inflection point in its history.
"Our shared grief is a poignant reminder that our collective future will hinge on our ability to recognize our common humanity and to act together," Mr. Biden said, referring to the millions of lives lost during the pandemic. He predicted that the next decade "will quite literally determine our futures."
He encouraged competition among rising powers, but stressed that he is "not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs."
"All the major powers of the world have a duty, in my view, to carefully manage their relationships so they do not tip from responsible competition to conflict," the president said.
Mr. Biden, now eight months into his presidency, campaigned on restoring U.S. alliances and leaned heavily on his foreign-policy experience as a globe-trotting former vice president and senator. During his first trip abroad last spring, he argued that "America is back" on the world stage.
In recent weeks, Mr. Biden has faced criticism for how the U.S. withdrew troops from Afghanistan as well as a drone strike that mistakenly killed Afghan civilians.
Congressional Republicans said Mr. Biden's address fell short after the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, which they said emboldened American adversaries and undercut allies. "Tough talk is useless if it's followed by weak actions," said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
U.S. relations with France, meanwhile, have hit a low point after Australia said last week that it would cancel a multibillion-dollar submarine deal with France to pursue a similar agreement with the U.S. and the U.K. France recalled its ambassadors to Washington and Australia, and the French foreign minister called the agreement a "stab in the back."
Mr. Biden met at midday in New York with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, where the two leaders emphasized their countries' longstanding partnership. After returning to Washington, Mr. Biden met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the White House.
In his speech, Mr. Biden pointed to a U.N. Security Council resolution passed this summer that urged the Taliban to provide safe passage for those wishing to leave the country. He called for the respect of human rights, including the "rights of women and girls to use their full talents."
Mr. Biden said the U.S. would continue to defend its interests and fight terrorism, but made the case that any military mission should have clear objectives, the consent of the American people and buy-in from allies. "U.S. military power must be our tool of last resort, not our first," he said.
The Biden administration has been working to shift international focus to Asia and counter the global influence of China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council that is seeking to carve out a major role in U.N. organizations.
Mr. Biden didn't mention China by name, but the nation was a theme of his remarks. He called for investment in global infrastructure, criticizing projects that are "low-quality or that feed corruption" in a tacit rebuke of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.

Full text: NEW YORK -- The coming climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, runs a "high risk of failure" unless world leaders take stronger measures to stem greenhouse gas emissions, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday.
Mr. Guterres made his comments after talks with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and other leaders attending the U.N. General Assembly meeting. They followed a U.N. report Friday that said the world isn't close to meeting targeted reductions in greenhouse gases laid out in the Paris climate accord in 2015.
Mr. Johnson called for the meeting on the sidelines of the General Assembly, the annual summit of world leaders at U.N. headquarters. A senior U.N. official described a "brutally honest" session in which leaders said that nations weren't acting fast enough and face dire consequences.
"This means that unless we collectively change course there is a high risk of failure" at the Glasgow summit in November, Mr. Guterres said. He called the meeting "a wake-up call to instill a sense of urgency on the dire state of the climate process."
In a meeting with President Biden Monday night, Mr. Guterres said that America has made "very strong commitment on climate change" under Mr. Biden's leadership.
Mr. Biden told Mr. Guterres that he had gone back and reread the United Nations charter and noted that every U.N. member nation has a responsibility to "uphold those fundamental commitments that we've all made."
The Glasgow summit, known as COP26, will be a chance for leaders to assess progress toward environmental goals set in Paris. The Paris agreement called for governments to limit the rise in global temperatures to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The recent U.N. report said the Earth is expected to be around 2.7 degrees Celsius warmer by the end of this century. Mr. Guterres said leaders must come out of Glasgow with more aggressive targets for reducing emissions to meet the target set in Paris.
U.N. officials, however, expressed optimism over progress in providing financing to poor countries that developed countries have promised but failed fully to deliver so far. Wealthy countries were supposed to give at least $100 billion annually starting in 2020 to help the developing world shift from fossil fuels and protect themselves against the effects of global warming.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- World leaders gathering this week for an annual United Nations meeting will confront persisting global problems such as Covid-19 and climate change, while grappling with new tensions and conflicts dividing U.N. members.
Leaders and envoys attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York will also contend with the return to power of the Taliban and the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, as well as the challenge posed by Iran under its new hard-line president, Ebrahim Raisi.
President Biden is scheduled to address the General Assembly for the first time as president on Tuesday, planning to appear in person after last year's virtual gathering.
The gathering this year takes place in the midst of new tensions including a diplomatic rupture between the U.S. and its ally France over a nuclear-submarine agreement. Australia, as part of the deal with the U.S. and the U.K., said it would cancel a multibillion-dollar contract to buy submarines from France. On Friday, France recalled its ambassadors to Washington and Australia.
French President Emmanuel Macron will address the U.N. on Tuesday, later than Mr. Biden.
China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin aren't expected to attend the session or address it directly, leaving the job to subordinates. Mr. Raisi is scheduled to speak later than Mr. Biden on Tuesday.
Mr. Biden, who has promised attention to international alliances, has rejoined the U.N.-organized Paris climate accord, reversed a move to exit from the World Health Organization and is campaigning for a U.S. seat on the U.N. Human Rights Council after the U.S. left the group under President Donald Trump.
In his speech, Mr. Biden is expected to address the pandemic and climate change while pressing governments -- including the new Taliban regime and China -- on rights issues.
U.S. positions on climate, health and rights issues highlight tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Biden administration has pressed China to make commitments on greenhouse-gas emissions, to reveal more about the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic and to stop undermining the autonomy of Hong Kong and detaining Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region.
While Afghanistan is likely to be a topic in many U.N. meetings, the new Taliban leadership is unlikely to have official representation. Some Taliban leaders face longstanding U.N. travel restrictions, and the world body hasn't ruled on any new representation for the country.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden said the U.S. is working with the European Union on a pledge to help cut global methane emissions by nearly a third by 2030, and he encouraged other countries to sign on to the effort.
"This will not only rapidly reduce the rate of global warming, but it will also produce a very valuable side benefit, like improving public health and agricultural output," Mr. Biden said Friday during remarks at the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, a long-dormant event that Mr. Biden revived ahead of United-Nations-led climate negotiations set for November in Glasgow.
More than a half-dozen global leaders joined Mr. Biden virtually for what he said would be a candid assessment of the threats of climate change. Much of the event was closed to the public.
The pledge would be the first global commitment to cut emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas less prevalent than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere but far more potent at trapping heat. Biden administration officials have been working for weeks to get the EU and others to sign on, focusing in particular on the world's largest economies and oil and gas producers.
Mr. Biden didn't say which other countries had agreed to support the pledge. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told world leaders during the session that the U.K. would join the methane-reduction effort, according to Mr. Johnson's office.
"We believe the collective goal is both ambitious, but realistic and we urge you to join us in announcing this pledge at COP26," Mr. Biden said, referring to the summit in Glasgow.
Dubbed the Global Methane Pledge, the agreement doesn't call for country-specific targets, but rather for the signatories to support an effort to reduce global, human-caused methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 compared with 2020 levels.
Policies aimed at cutting methane emissions could fall the heaviest on oil-and-gas companies, one of the leading sources. Methane can escape into the atmosphere from leaks at drilling and storage sites or as it moves through pipelines on its way to customers including power plants and homeowners who heat with natural gas. The farming and waste-management industries also are significant sources of methane emissions.
Galvanizing world leaders to force steep emissions cuts has proven difficult, and the public list of attendees for Friday's forum notably didn't include heads of state from China, the world's top emitter of greenhouse gases, or some staunch U.S. allies such as Canada and Germany.
Attending the virtual event were the leaders of Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the U.K., the European Commission, the European Council and the United Nations, according to the White House. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. climate envoy John Kerry attended in person.
Lower-level officials from China, Russia, Germany and India also participated, according to the White House.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N. body, in August said reduced methane emissions would be one of the most effective and immediate ways to slow climate change. But methane emissions have been rising for several decades, driven by industrial-scale farming and growing energy demand, especially for natural gas.
Russia, the world's largest methane emitter according to the International Energy Agency, hasn't agreed to the Global Methane Pledge.
Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't participate.

Full text: The Earth is expected to be about 2.7 degrees Celsius warmer by the end of this century than in the preindustrial era under emissions plans drafted for the Paris climate accord, the United Nations said Friday, putting the world far off track from the agreement's climate targets.
The report is drafted by U.N. scientists based on the most recent emissions plans from 191 countries that were submitted to the U.N. by July 31. The 2.7-degree Celsius figure is part of a range of end-of-century temperature estimates between 2.1 and 3.5 degrees of warming.
The U.N.'s report shows the challenges facing governments as they prepare to gather in Scotland for the first major climate summit since the Paris accord in 2015. The Paris agreement called for governments to limit the rise in global temperatures to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius and required them to update their environmental plans repeatedly to hit the target. Friday's report is expected to serve as a starting point for negotiations in Glasgow about how much the world needs to cut emissions and which countries need to do more.
Economies world-wide have been rapidly adopting solar panels, wind turbines and other low-emission technologies, but scientists say the shift from fossil fuels hasn't been happening nearly fast enough to stop rising sea levels, more frequent and powerful storms and other impacts of climate change.
China, the world's biggest emitter, and India, the second-most-populous nation, have yet to submit updated emission reduction plans to the U.N., so Friday's report doesn't include plans they have announced but not formally submitted. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in December that China was aiming to get 25% of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 and become carbon neutral before 2060.
The world stands little chance of hitting the Paris climate target without China updating the last climate plan it submitted to the U.N., which dates from 2016, the U.N. report said. Global greenhouse-gas emissions are expected to have risen by 16% by 2030 compared with 2010, based on the climate plans submitted by the end of July, the U.N. said.
"The 16% increase is a huge cause of concern," said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of U.N. Climate Change. "It is in sharp contrast with the calls by science for rapid, sustained and large-scale emission reductions to prevent the most severe climate consequences."
China and India are expected to see greenhouse gases increase significantly in the coming years. The Biden administration and the European Union have called for China to begin cutting emissions sooner.
The U.N. report also notes that many of the emissions plans submitted by developing countries are contingent on receiving financing that the developed world pledged to them under the Paris accord.
Wealthy countries promised poorer nations at least $100 billion annually starting in 2020 to shift away from fossil fuels and protect themselves against the effects of global warming. That pledge likely hasn't been met, said the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. On Friday, the OECD said rich countries provided only $80 billion in financing in 2019.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the success of the Glasgow summit rests on developed countries meeting the $100 billion target.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Democrats are taking a fresh look at their proposals for reducing carbon emissions in their $3.5 trillion spending package, hoping to win over moderate party members who raised concerns about elements of the plan.
Democrats have laid out a variety of provisions aimed at combating climate change in the wide-ranging proposal, including tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles, a program to push utilities to produce more clean electricity and a fee on methane emissions. Now, in an effort to unite the party, lawmakers are considering changes and eyeing alternative options, including a carbon tax.
Criticism from Democrats has focused on the clean electricity performance program, a centerpiece of the package's climate provisions. House Democrats unveiled a $150 billion plan that would provide grants to utilities that increase the amount of clean electricity by at least 4% each year, while penalizing utilities that don't meet that standard.
Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), who represents a top coal-producing state and is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has lambasted the proposal. He argued that market forces are already moving electricity suppliers away from fossil fuels.
"Why should we be paying utilities to do what they're already doing? We're transitioning," Mr. Manchin said.
Mr. Manchin's concerns have pushed other Democrats to review the design of the program. Sen. Tina Smith (D., Minn.), who has led efforts to craft the clean electricity performance program in the Senate, said she is in talks with Mr. Manchin, with an aim toward broadening the program to better incorporate carbon-capture technology. Sufficient carbon-capture technology, which involves pulling emissions out of the air, could allow states with large fossil-fuel industries -- like West Virginia -- to rely on the same energy mix and avoid penalties for utilities.
Mr. Manchin isn't alone in his criticism of the plan. Some Democrats questioned whether the plan would disadvantage states that have already transitioned away from fossil fuels, while other colleagues echoed his concerns about supplanting market forces.
"The transition away from coal is already happening, market forces and consumer demand are bringing more solar and wind resources online daily," said Rep. Tom O'Halleran (D., Ariz.). "We don't need blunt penalties that are impossible for energy producers to avoid."
Republicans have railed against the climate efforts as well as the rest of the $3.5 trillion plan. Democrats are using a procedure called reconciliation, which requires just a simple majority in the Senate rather than the 60 votes required of most bills, to try to advance the package without GOP votes. Doing so will require achieving unanimous Democratic support in the 50-50 Senate, along with near unanimity in the House, while also complying with a series of special parliamentary rules associated with reconciliation.
Democrats crafted the clean electricity payment program, an adaptation of a clean electricity standard, in an effort to comply with reconciliation's rules, though that push could still ultimately come up short, if the Senate parliamentarian finds it inconsistent with the chamber's standards.
As talks continue on the clean electricity effort, Senate Democrats have reviewed with fresh interest an alternative for cutting emissions: a carbon tax, according to a Senate Democratic aide. Senate Democrats and staff are discussing a carbon tax that would charge between $10 and $20 per ton of carbon emissions, a lower price than that of some other public proposals, and exempt gasoline, according to the aide.
Depending on the specifics of the tax, it could raise more than $500 billion, and Democrats are discussing whether those funds would be put toward covering the cost of the $3.5 trillion bill or as rebates for consumers, the aide said.
Revenue-raising options circulated this month among Senate Finance Committee Democratic staff included a carbon price, laying out the possibility of charging $15 per ton of carbon emissions from fossil fuels, a tax per ton of carbon emissions from industrial emitters and a per-barrel tax on crude oil.
The emerging carbon tax proposal could face some of the same political headwinds as the clean electricity program has from moderate Democrats. The aide said conversations with White House officials about the idea have focused on how to craft the tax so it is consistent with President Biden's pledge to not raise taxes on people making less than $400,000.
Carbon pricing has lost its luster among some Democrats and climate activists after the failure of the 2009 cap-and-trade effort, which sought to require companies to buy permits to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. But others view a carbon tax as the best tool for reducing emissions.
"I continue to maintain that a technology-neutral, economywide price on carbon is a more efficient and effective way to incentivize the movement away from fuels that drive climate change," said Rep. Scott Peters (D., Calif.).

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said he was taking a hard look at cryptocurrency-trading platforms in a hearing Tuesday in which he called for more funding for the regulatory agency.
Mr. Gensler also reiterated his openness to potentially banning payment for order flow, a practice in which stockbrokers sell customers' trades to high-speed trading platforms.
The official appeared before the Senate Banking Committee to outline a far-reaching policy agenda that would shake up some Wall Street firms' business models and require heftier disclosures from public companies. He emphasized the SEC's mission of protecting investors while pointing to challenges stemming from emergent technologies like cryptocurrency and sophisticated data analytics used by financial firms.
"More retail investors than ever are accessing our markets," Mr. Gensler told the committee. Noting that the SEC's staff has declined 4% since fiscal 2016, he repeatedly called for Congress to provide more resources for the agency to police capital markets that have grown in size and complexity.
Since being confirmed by the Senate in April, Mr. Gensler has laid out a regulatory agenda that some experts say would be the most significant revamp of securities law in decades.
Among the major fights looming with industry groups are potential rule changes for brokers that sell customers' orders to high-speed trading firms, the SEC's plans to increase public companies' disclosure requirements about their workforces and risks stemming from climate change, and efforts to police the fast-growing cryptocurrency market.
Republicans have argued that the SEC's agenda under Mr. Gensler is partisan and risks limiting investors' opportunities in the effort to protect them. They also warned him to tread lightly in his effort to police cryptocurrency markets, citing industry arguments that greater regulation could force financial innovation overseas.
"As to the people and the companies that you regulate as chairman of the SEC, do you consider yourself to be their daddy?" said Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.). "Why do you impose your personal preferences about cultural issues and social issues on companies and therefore their customers and their workers?"
Mr. Gensler replied that investors are seeking more information about issues such as the risks to companies posed by climate change.
"If investors want information about climate risk -- and it looks like tens of trillions of dollars of assets under management are asking -- then we at the SEC have a role to put something out to notice and comment, do the economic analysis, and really see what investors are saying," he said.
Mr. Gensler renewed calls for cryptocurrency-trading platforms to "come in and talk to us," given the SEC's view that many of the assets they offer to investors meet the agency's definition of a security.

Full text: Officials in the U.S. and European Union are crafting a pledge to reduce global methane emissions by nearly a third by 2030, and pushing several of the world's largest economies to join them, according to people familiar with the effort.
The agreement would mark the first global commitment to cut emissions of methane, a gas less prevalent than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere but far more potent at trapping heat. Dubbed the Global Methane Pledge, the agreement doesn't call for country-specific targets, but rather for the signatories to support an effort to reduce global, human-caused methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 compared with 2020 levels, one of the people said.
U.S. and EU officials have agreed to the deal and plan to announce their commitments Friday at a virtual climate summit that President Biden is hosting ahead of next week's United Nations General Assembly, according to another person familiar with the effort.
The officials are working to get China, Russia and other major oil and gas producers to join the commitment as a cornerstone accomplishment for international climate talks scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, these people said. News of the agreement was earlier reported by Reuters.
Representatives of the White House and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency referred questions to U.S. climate envoy John Kerry's office. A spokeswoman for Mr. Kerry declined to comment. Mr. Kerry and his team have been in India as part of their efforts to lobby other nations ahead of November's talks.
The European Commission spokesman on climate and energy policy, Tim McPhie, declined to comment.
The push for a methane deal is coming as part of negotiations to carry out the terms of the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement, a voluntary pact with no enforcement mechanism.
Methane's properties as a heat-trapping greenhouse gas are at least 25 times as strong as those of carbon dioxide, scientists have estimated. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N. body, in August said reduced methane emissions would be one of the most effective and immediate ways to slow climate change.
Policies aimed at cutting methane emissions could fall the heaviest on oil-and-gas companies, one of the leading sources. Methane can escape into the atmosphere from leaks at drilling and storage sites or as it moves through millions of miles of pipelines on its way to customers including power plants and homeowners who heat with natural gas. The agriculture and waste-management industries are also significant sources of methane emissions.
The agreement is coming together as EPA officials work to finish new rules under the Clean Air Act aimed at cutting methane leaks from U.S. oil and natural-gas production facilities. New rules are expected as soon as this fall, potentially incorporating more inspections or monitoring technology to prevent and stop leaks.
Mr. Biden as a presidential candidate pledged to craft more stringent rules for this source of greenhouse-gas emissions, alongside similar efforts for other leading sources of carbon-dioxide emissions, power plants and cars and trucks.

Full text: The two main sponsors of the 2010 financial-regulatory legislation that bears their names said Monday that President Biden should reappoint Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term.
The endorsement of Mr. Powell by former Sen. Chris Dodd (D., Conn.) and former Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.) is notable because the Fed chairman has encountered stiff resistance from some liberal Democrats who are disappointed at measures to ease financial regulations under Mr. Powell. They have cited that record in urging Mr. Biden to pick someone else to lead the Fed when Mr. Powell's term expires in February.
In an opinion article published on the website of the The Hill newspaper, Messrs. Dodd and Frank said reappointing Mr. Powell would do more to advance Mr. Biden's economic agenda because of his support for an overall monetary policy that has emphasized healing the labor market after the coronavirus pandemic.
"Dumping Powell and putting any kind of traditional liberal in there, who I would ordinarily prefer, in this climate complicates the political problem on the best issue we have," Mr. Frank said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Monday.
Mr. Frank said Mr. Powell, a Republican who was appointed Fed chairman by former President Donald Trump, has helped to avoid further polarizing a debate over how to best manage economic growth at a time when inflation has soared but unemployment remains elevated.
Mr. Powell argued when the coronavirus pandemic hit last year that the U.S. should aggressively deploy fiscal policy to limit scarring from long spells of unemployment or business failures. He repeated that message as recently as February, when he warned that the costs of doing too little were greater than the hazards of doing too much.
"I want a debate about how the government should best respond to economic problems, not whether it should even try. If it's not Powell, we're back in the latter," Mr. Frank said. "Getting support for Biden's economic program is the single most important thing right now, and Powell's denial that inflation is either imminent or inevitable given the program is a very big deal."
Five House Democrats last month, including Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called on Mr. Biden to "reimagine a Federal Reserve focused on eliminating climate risk and advancing racial and economic justice" by appointing a new Fed chair. They said Mr. Powell had done too little to address climate change and they criticized the steps the Fed has taken to relax certain financial rules.
Mr. Frank rebutted criticism lodged against Mr. Powell, including by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who has sharply chided Mr. Powell's regulatory record. "The changes he was making on financial regulation were pretty marginal," Mr. Frank said.
Fed governor Lael Brainard, who is widely considered the front-runner to succeed Mr. Powell if he isn't reappointed, would be "marginally better on regulation, maybe, but the impact that Powell has politically [on economic policy] is enormously greater than Brainard," Mr. Frank said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden said he plans to nominate Rostin Behnam as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and announced two additional picks to fill vacancies at the derivatives regulator.
Mr. Behnam has served as a CFTC commissioner since 2017 and has run the agency as acting chairman since Mr. Biden took office in January.
In addition, Mr. Biden said he plans to nominate law professor Kristin Johnson and government watchdog Christy Goldsmith Romero as commissioners at the agency, which regulates markets for hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives. The picks, if confirmed by the Senate, would give Democrats a 3-1 majority at the CFTC.
Mr. Behnam has focused on risks to the financial system stemming from climate change during his tenure at the CFTC.
In March, Mr. Behnam established a so-called climate-risk unit at the CFTC that is focused on "the role of derivatives in understanding, pricing and addressing climate-related risk and transitioning to a low-carbon economy."
As a commissioner last year, he sponsored a group on a CFTC advisory committee that published a report on climate-related risks despite skepticism about climate change in other parts of the Trump administration.
Ms. Johnson teaches law at Emory University, where she has focused on regulation of capital and credit markets. Her recent work has examined emerging technologies such as blockchain and digital assets, a potential boon to the CFTC as it works alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.
Since 2012, Ms. Goldsmith Romero has served as special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was established by Congress to stabilize the financial system after the 2008 crisis. In that role, she conducts investigations and audits of the federal response to the crisis and has urged Congress to require chief executives to certify annually that they found no criminal conduct or civil fraud in their firms.

Full text: BERLIN -- One of the hottest campaign topics in Germany's national elections is something that is a distant dream for the country's younger voters: pensions.
Older voters have long had a determining influence on elections in Germany. As the aging country grows even older -- the over-60 now make up more than a third of the electorate, according to the government -- they are becoming the key target of political parties' messages, something a new cadre of politically savvy influencers is trying to change.
"No millennial knows Helmut Schmidt anymore. They only know [departing Chancellor] Angela Merkel," said Dr. Wolfgang Grundinger, a 37-year-old author of political books. Mr. Schmidt was the country's chancellor from 1974-1982, and his image features in a campaign ad. "Even the Greens try to appeal to the old voters because the young voters, they elect them anyways," Mr. Grundinger said.
Older voters -- those above or near retirement age -- aren't just a big part of the electorate, they are also more likely to vote in a country that routinely has turnout rates around 70% for national ballots. By comparison, Pew Research Center estimates that U.S. turnout was 56% in 2016 and rose into the 60s in 2020. Some younger voters in Germany say this means their interests aren't being addressed enough in the campaign.
"No one talks about teens and the young professionals [age] 15 to 30," said Paulina Kintzinger, 24, who works on the election campaign for Annika Klose, a 29-year-old member of the center-left Social Democratic Party and candidate for the federal parliament in Berlin's central district. "[It's] like these 15 years of potential voters doesn't exist in the German campaign."
Whereas American politicians trip over themselves to win over young voters, dangling everything from policy proposals on student debt to massive get-out-the-vote concerts and celebrity cameos in campaign ads, establishment politicians in Germany promise stability, not change, and often appeal to nostalgia.
This means efforts to mobilize younger voters and focus the parties' attention on the issues these voters care about have mainly come from non-politicians this year.
Germans have even coined a word for young (and youngish) social-media celebrities who have espoused political causes: "Sinnfluencer," a portmanteau of the words "Sinn," German for sense or purpose, and influencer.
These include 25-year-old climate activist Luisa Neubauer. In one Instagram post, she showed her estimate of the per capita carbon-dioxide emissions represented by each party's platform. Sustainability influencer Louisa Dellert, 31, has used her Instagram account to discuss the various parties' positions on the speed limit on German highways. Each woman reaches hundreds of thousands outside traditional media.
"Every young person who says that politicians don't care about them a lot -- to me, it makes a lot of sense and it's kind of no surprise," Ms. Neubauer said.
"There are parties in this government that freak out just by the thought that 16-year-olds could be voting," she said, pointing to recent debate in Germany about lowering the voting age. "And that says a lot about whom politicians think they're working for and whom they're not working for."
Inclusion and accessibility advocate Raul Krauthausen, 41, said he is considering explicitly endorsing a candidate on his Instagram account. One of his recent efforts has focused on pressuring the makers of the "Wahl-O-Mat" app and website, which recommends which party to vote for after a user responds to a quiz on election issues, into offering a friendlier interface for people with disabilities. He shares messages from people frustrated with the app's accessibility on his social-media accounts.
"There are some activists who are really angry now, and I tried to give them more reach with my followers," Mr. Krauthausen said.
Rezo, a blue-haired German YouTuber known for his music videos, made his foray into the political circuit when he posted a scathing criticism of the center-right Christian Democratic Union days ahead of the 2019 European election.
The CDU pushed back against the entertainer, who doesn't give his real name, with a document fact-checking his claims, then went on to score a historically low 28.9% of the vote at that election while the Greens shot up to a historically high 20.5% on the back of a campaign focused on preventing climate change.
Sandwiched between videos about electric cars and German soccer's Bundesliga, Rezo last month uploaded another anti-CDU video that begins by hitting the party for its response to this summer's catastrophic flooding and characterizes its climate policy as insufficient.Afollow-up posted in early September takes aim at what he describes as a cozy relationship between politicians and coal companies.
While the share of young voters in the electorate is small, participation among the young is high by U.S. standards. Turnout hovers around 68% for voters under age 30 and creeps up to the low 70s for voters under age 40.
Despite this, "most of the parties and especially the big parties have a stronger focus on issues that are of interest [to the over 60]," said Dr. Andreas Jungherr, 39, chair of political science at the University of Bamberg.
Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat and the leading contender for the chancellery, has said his government would focus on fighting child poverty, making housing more affordable and shoring up the country's pay-as-you-go pension system. The conservative CDU and the free-market Free Democratic Party have put tax cuts high on their agenda.
---
Younger Voters
'Ready for Change'
Some pollsters think the lack of focus on younger voters is politically risky.
The German political system has grown more fragmented over time: There are now six parties in parliament compared with three less than 40 years ago and the most popular is polling at just 25%. This means smaller groups of voters could now more easily influence the shape of the next government, especially this year when polls suggest the next ruling coalition will have to include three parties for the first time.
"My generation feels like we are so ready for change," said Paulina Kintzinger, a Social Democratic Party campaigner, reflecting on Angela Merkel's 16-year stewardship of the country that earned her the maternal nickname "Mutti," meaning "mum."
"At some point you don't need them anymore because you've grown up," she said.

Full text: Harvard University's endowment doesn't plan to invest in companies that explore for fossil fuels and is investing in funds that support moving to a green economy, the university's president said.
"Given the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries to make long-term investment decisions that support our teaching and research mission, we do not believe such investments are prudent," Harvard President Larry Bacow said in a letter on Thursday.
Harvard Management Company, which runs the school's endowment, said in a February report that it wasn't directly exposed to companies that "explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels."
Its overall exposure to fossil fuels was less than 2% at the end of fiscal 2020, HMC said, down from about 11% at the end of fiscal 2008.
Harvard has one of the biggest university endowments, with a market value of more than $40 billion at the end of June 2020.
Universities across the U.S. have been facing pressure to stop investing in fossil fuels as student activists and alumni have pushed for a shift, citing alarm over and the effects of climate change.
A recent report from a scientific panel working under the auspices of the United Nations said that effects of a warming climate, spurred by human activity's greenhouse-gas emissions, may be irreversible for centuries.
Mr. Bacow, Harvard's president, in his letter on Thursday, cited the U.N. report and called climate change "the most consequential threat facing humanity."
A Harvard alumni activist group that is against the fossil-fuel industry in August 2020 won three seats on the school's Board of Overseers, which takes part in appointing the people who oversee the endowment's managers.
The alumni group had pushed the school's endowment to stop investments in oil-and-gas companies.

Full text: A centrist Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee said President Biden should nominate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term, the latest volley in an intraparty rift over the future leadership of the Fed.
Montana Sen. Jon Tester said in an interview Wednesday that he was concerned by recent calls from progressive House Democrats to replace Mr. Powell with someone who would focus the Fed on advancing liberal political priorities, including climate change. Mr. Tester said he worried doing that would harm the economy by politicizing the central bank.
"They should not be involved in the political footballs thrown around on Capitol Hill. That's the reason I want Jerome Powell. He's proven he can maintain the independence of the Fed," said Mr. Tester.
Mr. Powell's four-year term as Fed chairman expires in February. He was nominated to the seven-member board of governors by President Barack Obama in 2011. Former President Donald Trump tapped Mr. Powell, a Republican and former private-equity executive, to serve as chairman beginning in 2018. Mr. Trump later attacked Mr. Powell, first for raising interest rates, and later for not cutting them more aggressively.
Mr. Biden's looming decision has opened a divide among Democrats. One group wants the central bank to be reoriented more explicitly to address priorities such as climate change and are pressing the White House to replace Mr. Powell when his term expires.
Five House Democrats last week, including Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called on Mr. Biden to "reimagine a Federal Reserve focused on eliminating climate risk and advancing racial and economic justice" by appointing a new Fed chair. They said Mr. Powell has done too little to address climate change and they criticized the steps the Fed has taken to relax certain financial rules.
Other progressive Democrats have lauded Mr. Powell's response to the coronavirus pandemic and his focus on elevating the importance of tighter labor markets, which they say greatly benefits minorities and other potential workers who typically struggle to find jobs. These backers have said strong and unique bipartisan support for Mr. Powell has insulated the central bank's policies against more intense partisanship across Washington.
House lawmakers play no formal role in the choice of Fed chair, which is subject to Senate confirmation. Though progressive senators have criticized Mr. Powell's record on easing financial regulation, none has called for him to be replaced.
Mr. Powell was confirmed by a comfortable margin for his current term, with 84 senators in favor; 68 of those remain in office, equally split between the party caucuses. In a closely divided Senate, moderate Democrats can be particularly influential.
The Fed declined to comment. A White House spokeswoman didn't respond to a request to comment.
Mr. Tester said he was concerned that some members of his party would risk further polarization of the institution. "I watched President Trump threaten [Powell] because he wouldn't do things President Trump wanted him to do, and he held to the independence that the Fed needed to have," said Mr. Tester. "I think it is incredibly dangerous if you move to the other side. That is incredibly shortsighted. It was shortsighted by the previous president, and it is shortsighted by the progressives."
The Senate Banking Committee will be charged with holding a confirmation hearing on Mr. Biden's nominee.
Mr. Tester said he had yet to speak to senior White House officials or Mr. Biden about the matter, but that he hoped to do so soon.
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) hasn't indicated if he would vote for Mr. Powell, as he did four years ago, but has voiced concerns about the Fed's direction on banking issues.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden used a trip to parts of the Northeast battered by the remnants of Hurricane Ida to press his case for the importance of federal investment to help communities better endure major storms.
Mr. Biden left Washington early Tuesday to visit Manville, N.J., and New York City to survey the damage after the storm, which made landfall last week, led to record-breaking rainfall, flash floods and tornadoes in the Northeast.
During a briefing by local officials and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell in New Jersey, Mr. Biden described extreme weather as a growing issue across the country, saying, "We can't turn it back very much but we can prevent it from getting worse."
The president is promoting a bipartisan bill to invest $1 trillion in infrastructure, which he touted Tuesday, and is seeking a Democratic deal for $3.5 trillion including education and climate provisions, plus tax increases. Mr. Biden said in New York that rebuilding without new investments aimed at mitigating severe storms wouldn't help. "You got to build better so if the storm occurred again, there would be no damage," he said.
Mr. Biden spoke about the damage he had seen, the people struggling and the floodwaters that he said "crashed through the streets, testing the aging infrastructure and taking lives."
The president has issued disaster declarations to make federal aid available to people in parts of New York and New Jersey impacted by the storm. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday the aid could be expanded, adding Mr. Biden had told New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy that he would help him with whatever he needed.
The Biden administration also said Tuesday it would call on lawmakers in Washington to pass a short-term funding measure, including upward of $24 billion for recovery efforts stemming from Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters. Officials didn't have an estimate on how much funding would be necessary to address the damage caused by Ida, but they anticipate it will increase the need for disaster relief by at least $10 billion as the fiscal year ends.
At the briefing in New Jersey, Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said storms are happening with "more frequency, with more intensity, with more rain."
"You and I were just discussing privately, any amount of climate resiliency infrastructure that Congress can send to your desk for signature, which I know you will support, instantly is a game changer for our state," Mr. Murphy told the president.
On Tuesday, New York City officials said they were going door-to-door in storm-affected neighborhoods to offer assistance. About 4,000 homeowners reported damage to the city's emergency-management department, said Commissioner John Scrivani. More than 200 businesses have reported damage, said Jonnel Doris, commissioner of the city's Department of Small Business Services.
Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana last week as a Category 4 storm packing 150-mile-an-hour winds and went on to pummel the Gulf Coast and the Northeast. The death toll rose over the weekend to at least 69 people, including at least 18 in New York and 27 in New Jersey, according to state officials.
Weather experts generally are reluctant to tie any single extreme weather event to climate change. But as global average temperatures rise, the warmer air holds more moisture, which can lead to heavier rains. In recent years, rainfall has been more concentrated in intense single-day rainstorms. Nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1996, said the Environmental Protection Agency.
Mr. Biden argued that climate change needs a global response, and he said he would participate in a global climate summit in Scotland this year.

Full text: Editors of 220 leading medical, nursing and public-health journals from around the world called for urgent action on climate change, in a joint editorial published on Sunday.
The editorial, which appeared in journals including the New England Journal of Medicine, the British Medical Journal and The Lancet, warns that current efforts aren't enough to address health problems resulting from rising global temperatures caused by emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
"Health is already being harmed by global temperature increases and the destruction of the natural world," the journals' editors say in the editorial. If unchecked, they say, rising temperatures "risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse."
In their shared statement, the editors press for "fundamental changes in how our societies and economies are organized and how we live" to limit future global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels -- a goal arising from the 2015 Paris climate summit.
Greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity have raised global temperatures by 1.1 degrees C since the Industrial Revolution began in the mid-19th century, according to scientific studies.
The editorial is aimed at world leaders participating in a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that begins on Sept. 14, as well as those who will be gathering in November at a global climate treaty conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The latter gathering, known as COP26, is expected to address more ambitious efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.
The editorial was published in journals from China, India, Australia, Africa and South America in addition to those from the U.S. and the U.K. The effort was organized by the U.K. Health Alliance on Climate Change, a coalition of 21 health organizations including the British Medical Association, the Royal Society of Medicine and the Royal College of Nursing.
"It is an unusual happening and it is driven by unusual circumstances," Eric J. Rubin, editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, said of the editorial. "It is evident that climate change is a problem. What is less evident to people is that it is a public-health problem, not just a physical catastrophe."
Rising temperature and other manifestations of climate change have brought higher rates of heart and lung ailments and infectious diseases, as well as of injuries and premature deaths tied to extreme weather, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, for example, extreme heat was blamed for the deaths of nearly 3,300 people in France, according to the Brussels-based Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters.
Climate change also takes a toll on mental health. Heat waves, floods and other extreme weather events -- which research shows have become more common as a result of climate change -- can cause anxiety and depression, according to the American Psychiatric Association. A 2019 study published in Nature Climate Change linked increased temperatures to a rise in suicides.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Senior Chinese officials told U.S. climate envoy John Kerry that continued U.S. hostility on a range of issues could jeopardize cooperation on fighting climate change, though Mr. Kerry said that working-level talks have been productive in the run-up to a November climate summit.
Mr. Kerry, wrapping up a two-day visit to the northern port city of Tianjin, was warned repeatedly by his hosts that climate cooperation couldn't be kept separate from worsening geopolitical ties between the two countries.
On Thursday, Yang Jiechi, leader Xi Jinping's top foreign-policy aide, told Mr. Kerry in a video call that the U.S. had interfered in China's internal affairs and harmed its interests, causing difficulties in the bilateral relationship.
A day earlier, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, while describing climate-change cooperation as an oasis in the desert, said that "cooperation on climate change cannot be divorced from the overall situation of China-U.S. relations."
Mr. Kerry said that he would pass along their message to Washington, but told reporters that he had been primarily focused during his visit on discussing nuts-and-bolts issues with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua. He described the talks with Mr. Xie as "very constructive and detailed."
Mr. Kerry also suggested the U.S. would like to see further high-level talks.
The Biden administration has said it wants to carve out space for cooperation with Beijing on climate change notwithstanding bilateral frictions in issues including trade, technology and human rights.
Mr. Kerry's visit, his second this year, comes ahead of a United Nations summit set to take place in Glasgow in November, where world leaders will discuss efforts to cut emissions and support developing nations in pursuing low-emission economic growth.
Mr. Xi said last year that China would reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions before 2060. Mr. Kerry is pushing for China to move even faster, suggesting in bilateral talks that China should reach net-zero emissions as early as 2050, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
Mr. Kerry's visit began with a tone that was tense but also open to collaboration, according to a person briefed on the talks from the Chinese side.
But Vice Premier Han Zheng balked at Mr. Kerry's call for China to announce more ambitious targets. During a video call between Messrs. Kerry and Han on Thursday, Mr. Han emphasized the importance of delivering on actions instead.
China says it already is moving faster than any developed country from carbon peak to carbon neutrality, projecting that while it will take Europe 60 years and the U.S. 45 years, China will accomplish that feat in 30 years.
China's economic-planning body has led the drafting of a road map for how the country will achieve Mr. Xi's climate pledges. Mr. Xie has said that China would publish the road map soon, without elaborating.
Mr. Kerry told reporters Thursday that it was important to bring up U.S. demands before China's plan is completed.
China has its own doubts about the U.S.'s ability to deliver on its promises. Researchers at a think tank affiliated with China's Environment Ministry said China should seek to collaborate with the U.S., but also prepare for the U.S. to withdraw again from the 2015 Paris Agreement, according to a July presentation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
One of President Biden's first acts in office this year was to re-enter the accord, from which then-President Donald Trump had withdrawn.

Steps Coming to Help
Housing Shortage
The Biden administration is poised to unveil a series of steps aimed at addressing the U.S. shortage of entry-level homes and rental properties, according to people familiar with the matter, moves designed to boost their financing and construction over the coming years.
The changes would draw upon the administrative authority of government regulators such as the Federal Housing Finance Agency as Congress weighs broader policy changes tied to the debate over revamping U.S. infrastructure, according to a draft plan reviewed Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.
Details could change before the White House releases its final version. FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two mortgage giants that back about half of the $11 trillion mortgage market.
The White House was expected to announce the moves as early as Wednesday, one of the people said.
One change would allow Fannie and Freddie to invest more of their resources into rental housing by boosting an existing regulatory cap on their investments in apartment projects supported by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.
Another piece would expand an existing competitive grant program for Community Development Financial Institutions, to encourage affordable housing production.
The administration can make the changes without congressional action.

VIRGINIA
Posthumous Pardons
Given to 7 Black Men
Gov. Ralph Northam granted posthumous pardons for seven Black men, known as the "Martinsville Seven," who were executed decades ago after all-white juries convicted them of raping a white woman.
The Democratic governor said Tuesday that the young men, most of whom were between 18 and 21 years old, weren't given fair due process and their executions were racially biased due to how the death sentence was used in cases involving white defendants.
Mr. Northam's office said the pardons don't have to do with the men's guilt but rather their "unjust, racial-biased sentences" and "disturbing lack of due process." The seven men were convicted and sentenced in eight days in 1951, the governor's office said, with some defendants "impaired" when they were arrested, unable to read their signed confessions or without attorneys present.
More than two decades after their executions, the Supreme Court ruled the death penalty was unconstitutional punishment for rape.
The families of the Martinsville Seven and advocates had urged Mr. Northam to pardon the men: Frank Hairston Jr., 18 years old; Booker T. Millner, 19; Francis DeSales Grayson, 37; Howard Lee Hairston, 18; James Luther Hairston, 20; Joe Henry Hampton, 19; and John Claybon Taylor, 21.
In a statement ahead of the governor's announcement Tuesday, relatives of the men said pardoning them would be a step in the right direction. "They did not deserve to die," said James Grayson, the son of Francis DeSales Grayson.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT
Input on Climate Risk
To Insurers Sought
The Treasury Department is seeking public input on the effects of natural disasters and other climate-related risks to the insurance industry.
A Treasury office charged with monitoring the insurance industry is seeking public input for 75 days on how climate change could affect private insurers, including which data are needed to develop standardized climate-related financial risk disclosures for the sector.
"Over the past 30 years, the incidence of natural disasters has dramatically increased and the actual and future potential cost to the economy has skyrocketed," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. "We are now in a situation where climate change is an existential risk to our future economy and way of life."

NEW YORK
Governor Picks Top
Financial Regulator
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul tapped an Obama administration veteran to be the state's top financial regulator, officials said Tuesday.
Adrienne Harris was nominated to lead the New York State Department of Financial Services, which oversees insurance companies and state-chartered banks. Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, said the agency's focus would be consumer protection and ensuring an equitable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Ms. Harris is now a senior adviser at public-relations firm Brunswick Group in Washington, D.C., where she advises financial institutions, fintech companies and venture-capital firms. She worked as a senior adviser in the U.S. Treasury Department from 2013 to 2015 and then as a special assistant in the White House until 2017. Ms. Harris's nomination is subject to confirmation by the New York State Senate.

Full text: The Department of Health and Human Services has launched an office that will treat climate change as a public-health issue, designed to address what the White House says are health risks, including those that disproportionately affect poor and minority communities.
Many details of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, which will report to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and the assistant secretary for health, were outlined in a January executive order on climate, part of President Biden's efforts to use the federal government to address the environmental effects of changing weather.
"Its mission is to protect the health of people experiencing a disproportionate share of climate impacts and health inequities from wildfires to drought, to hurricanes to floods," Mr. Becerra said at a news briefing Monday.
The office is likely to spur initiatives touching on many aspects of healthcare, HHS officials announced Monday. It is expected to offer protections for populations most at risk -- including the elderly, minorities, rural communities and children, and the office could eventually compel hospitals and other care facilities to reduce carbon emissions.
Asked how HHS would reduce carbon emissions from healthcare facilities, Mr. Becerra said: "We will use every authority to its greatest advantage because it is time to tackle climate change now."
Officials said one of the first tasks for the office would be to take accounting of greenhouse gas emissions from various parts of the healthcare sector. They also said they don't yet have specific goals for the reduction in emissions they want from healthcare facilities.
The move is certain to draw opposition from many Republicans and conservative activists who criticized Mr. Becerra during his spring confirmation process for policy positions he took while serving as California's attorney general. These include his support of "environmental justice," a movement that focuses on preventing a disproportionate share of negative environmental consequences for any population.
Under Mr. Becerra's leadership, California sued the Trump administration dozens of times, often over environmental issues, and in 2018 his office created the Bureau of Environmental Justice that today has a team of attorneys fighting development projects deemed to endanger vulnerable communities.
Mr. Becerra has tapped Arsenio Mataka, who served as his environmental adviser when Mr. Becerra was California's attorney general, to join HHS as senior adviser for climate change and health equity. John Balbus, a senior adviser at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which conducts research into the effects of the environment on human disease, is moving to the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health to help set up the office.
Dozens of organizations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, and the American Psychological Association, have lined up to urge the new office to take specific actions. But other parts of the medical industry might resist.
Hospitals, in particular, are worried the initiative will mean complying with new regulations when healthcare facilities are struggling with the costs of fighting the pandemic.

Full text: U.S. special climate envoy John Kerry plans another trip to China next week, where he will press Chinese leaders to declare a moratorium on financing international coal-fired projects, according to people familiar with the matter.
Beijing hasn't funded any new foreign coal plants or investments this year -- the first time that has happened since China embarked on its infrastructure Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, according to a recent study by the Beijing-based International Institute of Green Finance.
U.S. officials now want Beijing to declare a formal halt to such projects, according to one of the people. For its part, China has emphasized the importance of fulfilling its current pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions before making new ones, another one of the people said.
Beijing doesn't want to be seen as caving in to pressure from the West, people familiar with Chinese policy makers' thinking say. Instead, China has been trying to position itself as a major global player in fighting climate change on its own terms.
Spokespeople for China's Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said they had no information to share with regard to any planned trip by Mr. Kerry, while China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment didn't respond to a faxed request to comment.
Reuters reported earlier that Mr. Kerry would travel to China in September. His visit would mark the third trip to China by a senior Biden administration official, and Mr. Kerry's second in five months.
Mr. Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, have spoken more than a dozen times this year, they have each said. Mr. Kerry's efforts underscore how climate has emerged as a rare area of potential cooperation between the U.S. and China -- the world's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide.
The Biden administration has characterized the bilateral relationship as one primarily of competition, though officials in Washington have made clear that on some issues -- including climate and Afghanistan -- there is room for cooperation.
Mr. Kerry's trip comes as world leaders aim to head off the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions. United Nations member states are seeking to fulfill the terms of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which pledged to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels, while aiming ideally to cap the increase at 1.5 degrees.
In June, the Group of Seven wealthy democracies agreed to make their climate goals consistent with the more ambitious 1.5-degree threshold.
China's role in reaching either target is seen as critical. Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged last year that China would reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve net zero emissions before 2060.
Mr. Kerry is pushing for China to move even faster. If China were to stick to its current climate plan, the rest of the world would have to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 or earlier to solve the climate crisis, Mr. Kerry said last month. President Biden announced in April that the U.S. is aiming to reach net zero emissions no later than 2050.
When pressed by former U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern at a public forum this month, Mr. Xie said that rather than setting new ambitions, countries should first deliver on existing promises.
Beijing has long been the biggest public financier of overseas coal projects, investing more than $50 billion in such projects, primarily in the developing world, over the past two decades, according to data from Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.
In recent months, however, China quietly has stopped approving or financing new overseas coal projects, a shift that has been praised by environmentalists. Even so, Mr. Kerry has been seeking to push Beijing to publicly declare a blanket moratorium ahead of the U.N. global climate summit, which is set to take place in Glasgow in November.
Beijing has been reluctant to claim official credit for its actions. It has resisted pressure from Western nations to make new public commitments.
"In the past, China talked green and acted brown. Nowadays, China acts green but talks brown," said a person who is advising the Chinese government on international coal financing.
People familiar with Beijing's thinking said China wants to champion the right of developing countries to continue using coal. In past climate talks, a fault line has split the developed and developing worlds.
Researchers at a think tank affiliated with China's Environment Ministry argued during internal meetings last month that consolidating the support of developing countries should remain a key pillar in China's climate diplomacy, according to a July presentation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Beijing's aversion to public commitments has left it isolated in multilateral settings where wealthy countries increasingly are converging around a consensus that more drastic actions are needed to combat climate change -- and are happy to proclaim their ambitious targets.
The lack of an official commitment also worries some climate activists. "By not officially committing to a moratorium, China is giving itself wiggle room to promote dirty fossil fuel in the future when the developing world starts recovering from the pandemic," says Li Shuo, Beijing-based policy adviser at Greenpeace.

Full text: RIGGINS, Idaho -- Beneath the vacancy sign at the Salmon River Motel, a black and white placard reads "Salmon Lives Matter, Give a Dam." For years the motel has been a profitable business in this canyon town of 400 three hours north of Boise, with a mile-long Main Street that swells each summer with visiting sport fishermen.
Now the motel and other businesses here are at risk, as the fish that drive the local economy shrink in both number and size.
This year, regional fish and wildlife agencies recorded one of the smallest counts of adult spring Chinook salmon in a generation in the Snake and Columbia river basin. Last year was worse. A wide body of research connects their decline to rising temperatures and climate change, which have compounded the damage done to fish populations by hydroelectric dams.
The impact of this decline ripples along this species' entire migratory route, from the tourist economies and tribal communities of the inland Northwest to the $2 billion commercial fishing industry in ocean waters as far as Alaska, where state fisheries report total harvest weight has dropped by half since the 1960s.
Across the inland Pacific Northwest, dwindling salmon runs have emptied motel rooms, tackle shops and restaurants. Business in Riggins this summer beat expectations as pandemic fears eased, but the continuing decline of the sought-after Chinook -- the largest of all Pacific salmon -- threatens to devastate economies and tribes throughout the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.
If salmon continue to decline, "it will hurt this town," said Salmon River Motel owner Jerry Walker, whose family of loggers suffered when the town's sawmill burned down in 1982. Without the fish that helped Riggins rebuild its economy, he said, "there's nothing else here."
Outdoor-resource tourism economies such as Riggins "are really fragile things," said Aaron Lieberman, executive director of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Association. The decline of one resource can cause a cascading effect, he said. "When you don't have fish runs, you don't have people coming, the entire economy is crippled."
Reports by the Idaho Department of Fish & Game show that salmon in the connected Columbia and Snake river basins in Idaho, Washington and Oregon first plummeted after the midcentury construction of eight hydroelectric dams that blocked or slowed migration. Fish must swim hundreds of miles downstream as finger-sized juveniles heading to sea, then return upstream again several years later to spawn.
State, federal and tribal governments developed a national hatchery system to mitigate these losses by releasing tens of millions of juvenile fish each year. By the early 2000s, it seemed those efforts were working: State data showed returning adults peaked around 2001. Riggins locals recall streets lined with RVs and great fishing for weeks on end. A state-commissioned economic analysis showed salmon fishing alone that year brought $10 million to Riggins, accounting for a quarter of the town's annual revenue.
Since then, research and fisheries data show spring Chinook runs are getting smaller and individual fish weigh less, too. Lower snowpack, warmer nights, and heat waves such as those that have blasted this region all summer have caused lower flows and warmer conditions inhospitable to these cold-water fish.
This spring, researchers at the Nez Perce Tribe Department of Fisheries Resources Management said 42% of wild Chinook populations in the Snake River Basin had reached "quasi-extinction levels" and predicted 77% of populations would fall to that level by 2025.
Hatcheries throughout the region still collect enough of their own returning fish to spawn and meet their production mandate, said Ralph Steiner, who manages the Rapid River National Hatchery near Riggins, but there are fewer left in the river for fishing. Because of rising water temperatures and earlier migrations associated with climate change, he said, their operations also face new challenges and increasing costs to replenish the fish vital to commercial, recreational and tribal fisheries.
This May, facing fewer salmon and tighter state restrictions, Riggins outfitter and guide Roy Akins canceled half his salmon bookings, returning a total of $15,000 to 60 fishermen he said were frustrated and disappointed. "Nobody wants to hear that the day they've been looking forward to is going to be taken away from them," Mr. Akins said.
As fishermen rethought travel plans, the Salmon River Motel saw normally booked-solid rooms sit empty, said Sharon Walker, referencing records from before she and her husband bought the property in August. Debbie Swift, who works at liquor and tackle store Hook Line & Sinker, said that tackle sales have decreased over the years, and that slow seasons and cancellations complicate inventory decisions.
Tribal communities say it isn't just their economic health, but their very existence that is at stake. For these communities, salmon are a sacred source of food and connection with the Earth, and are at the root of tribes' cultures, languages and songs, said Aja DeCoteau, interim director of the Intertribal Fish Commission coordinating management efforts of four tribes in the Columbia Basin.
Ms. DeCoteau, a Yakama Tribe member, said lately there are years when there aren't enough fish to sell, let alone fill her community's freezers for the year.
This year, Mr. Akins, Nez Perce leaders and conservation groups backed a proposal by Rep. Mike Simpson (R., Idaho) calling for redeveloping energy infrastructure and breaching the Snake River dams, citing the increasing threat of climate change and the enormous cost of salmon extinction to his state.

Full text: Georgia has no mandates requiring power companies to add renewable energy and hasn't made climate change a political priority. Solar power is booming there anyway.
The state went from having virtually no solar industry a decade ago to ranking ninth nationwide in installed solar capacity this year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Solar has flourished in Georgia as tech companies such as Facebook Inc. look to locate facilities near cheap renewable-energy sources and rural communities turn to solar farms to create tax revenues and jobs.
Much of the initial build-out of solar and wind power in the U.S. in the past three decades was driven by mandates in states such as Iowa, California, Colorado and New York that required utilities to source a certain amount of renewables. But wind and solar are now gaining market share even in states with no such requirements, as Georgia's experience shows.
Republican regulators have pushed the state's major utility, Southern Co. subsidiary Georgia Power, to invest in solar, saying that economic factors make it an attractive energy source beyond its carbon-free characteristics.
"Don't come into my office talking about climate change or the environment," said Tim Echols, who has served for the past decade on the elected, all-Republican public-service commission that regulates the state's investor-owned utilities. "Talk about new jobs, talk about low-cost energy, talk about reduction of transmission lines," he said. "Learn to speak Republican here."
Solar installation prices in Georgia have fallen 43% over the past five years, according to data from SEIA. Similar declines in price are behind the solar-industry growth in states across the Southeast, many of which also lack renewable-energy mandates.
"I oppose any renewable portfolio standard -- it's not necessary." said Lauren "Bubba" McDonald, who serves with Mr. Echols on the public-service commission.
Georgia Power, which serves 2.6 million customers across the state, has added more than 570 solar projects totaling close to 2,000 megawatts to its energy portfolio in the past decade, according to company spokesman Jeff Wilson.
While Georgia Power has led the state in solar additions, rural Georgia's smaller electric membership cooperatives, or EMCs, have leaned into solar power as well, catching the eye of large companies like Facebook. The tech giant has partnered with Walton EMC in northern Georgia, which will buy energy on Facebook's behalf through a long-term power purchase agreement with a solar developer, Tennessee-based Silicon Ranch Corp.
Silicon Ranch will in turn develop, own and operate the six projects, totaling 434 megawatts, that will help power Facebook's data center in Newton County. The solar developer said it has invested more than $1 billion in rural communities in Georgia, making it the largest taxpayer in multiple jurisdictions.
"We are committed to bringing renewable energy close to where we operate," said Urvi Parekh, who leads Facebook's renewable-energy team.
The bump in investment from the solar-power projects ends up having a significant impact on the local communities where the projects are sited, said Jeff Pratt, president of Green Power EMC, an entity that secures renewable resources on behalf of the state's 41 electric cooperatives. Those EMCs serve roughly 4.4 million of the state's 10 million residents in mostly rural areas, which encompass some of the poorest counties in the country.
While solar projects can add jobs, a lot of the new employment growth can be temporary, with opportunities petering out after construction is completed, said John Howard, mayor of Monroe in Walton County. Coal power plants take twice as many workers to generate a megawatt hour of electricity as do solar farms, according to estimates from BW Research Partnership, an economic and workforce consulting firm.
The projects can be unpopular with farmers, since plots of agricultural land usually need to be cleared for the installation of solar panels. Integrating the solar projects with agricultural practices has helped ease some of those concerns, said Matt Beasley, Silicon Ranch's chief commercial officer.
Mr. Beasley has started to see the growth of solar power changing the politics of renewable energy in the state. People are beginning to associate solar plants with energy resiliency, job creation and economic growth without much disturbance to the rural landscape, he said.
"The pendulum is swinging back, and climate change is starting to become a part of the discussion now," Mr. Beasley said. "The economics are such that you can have your cake and eat it too."

Full text: A recent shipment of 24 metric tons of Swedish steel could mark the beginning of what the steel industry hopes is a new era: the cleanup of one of the world's dirtiest industries.
Big steelmakers in Europe and the U.S., like ArcelorMittal SA and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., are intensifying efforts to curb carbon emissions, hoping to woo customers and fend off growing pressure from investors and governments. On Thursday, Sweden's SSAB AB shipped what it said was the world's first commercial shipment of steel made without fossil fuels to truck maker Volvo AB.
But progress is slower in the developing world, where the majority of steel is made, and that means the sector will likely remain a big emitter for years to come, analysts say. Greening the industry is also costly, and that is expected to make the steel used in cars, buildings and householder appliances more expensive.
The challenge facing the steel industry epitomizes the difficulty of decarbonizing the wider economy, as governments and investors put greater emphasis on curbing climate change. Steel generates 7% of global carbon-dioxide emissions related to energy consumption, more than any other industrial sector, according to the International Energy Agency. With demand for steel projected to rise, the IEA says the industry's emissions need to halve by 2050 for the world to hit global climate goals.
"I do accept that in the short term, this transition is difficult," ArcelorMittal Chief Executive Aditya Mittal said in an interview.
Steel is a big carbon emitter because of the way it is made. The World Steel Association says over 70% of steel is still produced using the more-than-a-century-old blast furnace process, in which coal is burned at high temperatures to reduce the oxygen in iron ore, eventually turning it into steel.
To reduce emissions, some companies are melting more scrap metal to make new steel, or employing so-called direct reduced iron, where oxygen is taken out without it being melted in a furnace, and exploring techniques like replacing coal with hydrogen -- which is how SSAB made the metal it sold to Volvo.
ArcelorMittal has pledged to invest $10 billion in its decarbonization program this decade, targeting a 25% reduction in carbon emissions per dollar of sales by 2030. Last month, it said one of its sites in Spain would become the world's first large-scale zero-carbon emissions steel plant. It expects to be minting metal, made using hydrogen and renewable power, by 2025.
Such initiatives can be costly. In 2018, SSAB estimated that its fossil-free steel would be 20% to 30% more expensive than its production at the time, though it predicted costs would fall. It declined to say how much the shipment to Volvo cost or was sold for. Earlier this year, ArcelorMittal told analysts that making steel using hydrogen at a plant in Germany would be 60% higher than the current cost.
In the U.S., 70% of steel production is already made using electric arc furnaces to melt scrap metal, a process that the IEA says uses only about an eighth of the energy used in steel produced from iron ore. The U.S. recycles enough steel scrap to build 25 Eiffel Towers every day, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
America's largest steel producer, Nucor Corp., uses only scrap steel. In July, the company said it wanted to reduce its carbon footprint by using more renewable energy and capturing carbon. United States Steel Corp. has also said it wants to deploy carbon-capture technology, and use more scrap, to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. U.S. Steel declined to comment on costs, while Nucor didn't respond to requests for comment.
Cleveland-Cliffs said it had already spent some $1.37 billion toward hitting its target of a 25% reduction in emissions by 2030 as compared with 2017 levels. That includes through a recently opened $1 billion direct reduction iron plant in Toledo, Ohio, carbon capture technology and other means.
Still, around 13% of global steel production last year came from the European Union, U.K. and North America, according to the World Steel Association.
China produces about 57% of the world's steel, and of that about 90% is made using blast furnaces, according to BHP PLC, a global coal supplier. China's furnaces are also relatively new, with an average age of 12 years, compared with 53 and 45 years in North America and Europe, respectively, BHP's data shows.
Steel analysts say there are fewer plans to decarbonize steel in China than in the West. China sees carbon emissions peaking in 2030 and trending toward net-zero emissions by 2060, though officials in the country recently limited the scope of a national carbon-trading system.

Full text: The French term terroir has been defined in various ways -- and called undefinable, too -- but it's generally understood to denote a combination of soil, topography and climate that gives a wine its particular character. With so many wine regions flooded or on fire in recent months and years, I've wondered: Does this change their terroir?
Terroir and climate have both been topics of fierce debate. Just as some people don't believe climate change is real, some oenophiles think terroir is a ruse, a mere marketing tool. Recent extreme weather events are certainly real: In this grape-growing season we have seen massive floods wash out vineyards in western Germany and severe drought affect California's wine regions. Is it possible that certain places may no longer be viable for the grapes traditionally grown there? And how might wine regions and the characteristics that define their wines shift as a result? When I put these questions to wine professionals, climate scientists and a terroir consultant, I heard conflicting answers as well as a few reasons to hope amid much despair.
Today, winemakers, marketers and writers alike tend to invoke "terroir" with reverence, to describe a distinctive wine of a notable place, but it wasn't always so. In his book "Terroir and Other Myths of Winegrowing," Mark A. Matthews notes, "[F]rom our earliest records, terroir is employed as a pejorative when describing wine flavor, and that undesirable flavor is described as the soil." Not until the French instituted the modern appellation d'origine controlee system for wines in the early 20th century, establishing the importance of a specific place and the unique conditions there to grape growing and winemaking, did the word acquire its current cachet.
When I talked to Chile-based terroir consultant Pedro Parra, who holds a Ph.D. in terroir, he defined terroir as a combination of nature and human intervention. Mr. Parra's book "Terroir Footprints" describes his work with viticulturists and winemakers all over the world and his passion for soil (and especially rocks). He believes climate change can alter a wine region's terroir.
Burgundy vigneron Veronique Boss-Drouhin, who oversees winemaking at her family's Beaune-based domaine, does not believe climate extremes have affected Burgundy's winemaking negatively. In an email she wrote, "Global warming has been a good thing for the quality of the wines." She cited increased temperatures as beneficial for a region where the weather in the 1970s and 1980s was often too cool or too rainy for grapes to ripen properly.
But even if quality remains high, extreme weather has certainly minimized the quantity of Burgundy wines. For example, three years in a row, 2012-2014, violent hailstorms damaged up to 40% of the harvest in the Cote de Beaune, while in 2016 many vines suffered from an intense frost in April. (While isolated hailstorms and late frosts occurred in the region historically, their consequences may be greater now. For example, the Bourgogne Wine Board found that the temperature in Burgundy has increased by one degree Celsius since 1987. This means earlier bud break and greater potential harm from spring frost.)
Ms. Boss-Drouhin's family also makes wine in Oregon, at Domaine Drouhin Oregon. Mr. Parra believes this U.S. state will be a prime destination for winemakers seeking new places to plant. When the Drouhins established their domaine in the Willamette Valley in 1987, the region was cooler and rainier than it is today. As the region's climate became sunnier and its weather and crops proved more reliable over time, other Burgundians established their own Oregon domaines. For instance, Jacques Lardiere, formerly of Maison Louis Jadot, established Resonance with Thibault Gagey in 2013, and Jean-Nicolas Meo of the famed Burgundy Domaine Meo-Camuzet created Nicolas-Jay in Oregon with his friend Jay Boberg in 2012. Mr. Parra, who makes wine at his own winery, Pedro Parra y Familia, in Chile's Itata Valley, sees the appeal. "If I had the resources I would buy in Oregon," he said. "It is becoming perfection in the balance of soil and weather."
Mr. Parra believes the changing climate could cause shifts both bad and good. "It brings opportunities for new regions and problems for old regions," he said. On the positive side, he cited the recent wave of Champagne houses that have invested in southern England, where temperatures have risen over the years, enabling grapes to ripen fully, and whose chalky soils are similar to those of Champagne. For a more troubling trend, one need look no further than the Napa Valley, repeatedly afflicted by fire and drought in recent years. Yet Napa's misfortune might mean enhanced opportunities for winemakers in other parts of the world -- Argentine Cabernet producers, for example, whose high-quality wines have for so long been eclipsed in the market by Napa's fame.
How dire might the situation in Napa become? Could things worsen to such a degree the region would be completely inhospitable to growing grapes? I put the question to Elisabeth Forrestel, assistant professor of viticulture at University of California, Davis. Prof. Forrestel is leading a research program on the effect of climate change, specifically heat extremes, and Napa Cabernet is one of the wines her team is studying.
"There is no question that we can continue to make wine in Napa," said Prof. Forrestel, who works with California grape growers in gathering research, "but that's not to say that practices won't change." She cited the need to pick grapes earlier, change water application practices and perhaps plant other varieties. "I think that Cabernet will still be there, but there will be more grape diversity," she said.
Oregon-based climatologist Greg Jones noted that drought is the most serious issue facing winemakers in California today. He, too, emphasized the need for grape diversity when we spoke by phone: "We have 5,000 different varieties out there and to a large degree we grow only 25 of them." Mr. Jones suggested that a variety such as Xinomavro, a red grape native to Greece, would do better in drought circumstances like Napa's than Cabernet Sauvignon does. Of course, replacing Cabernet with Xinomavro isn't just a matter for winemakers to consider; marketers and wine buyers need to get on board, too. "We have to retrain customers," Mr. Jones said.
I don't know if I'll be around to see cult Xinomavros from Napa, but surely diversifying grape varieties, picking earlier and altering irrigation practices would alter the terroir of any wine region. In other words, human intervention may become an increasingly important factor in the expression of terroir. As Mr. Parra put it, "The interpretation of the winemaker is important. The winemaker is the doctor."

Full text: WASHINGTON COUNTY, Pa. -- Drones darted in patterns above natural-gas wells in the hills of southwest Pennsylvania, as workers atop water tanks pointed specialized cameras, and a helicopter outfitted with a laser-light detection system swooped in low. All searched for an invisible enemy: methane.
The U.S. gas industry faces growing pressure from investors and customers to prove that its fuel has a lower-carbon provenance to sell it around the world. That led the top U.S. gas producer, EQT Corp., and the top exporter, Cheniere Energy Inc., to team up and track the emissions from wells that feed major shipping terminals. The companies are trying to collect reliable data on releases of methane -- a potent greenhouse gas attracting scrutiny for its contributions to climate change -- and demonstrate they can reduce these emissions.
"What we're trying to really do is build the trust up to the end user that our measurements are correct," said David Khani, EQT's chief financial officer. "Let's put our money where our mouth is."
Natural gas boomed world-wide over the past few decades as countries moved to supplant fossil fuels such as coal and oil. It has long been touted as a bridge to a lower-carbon future. But while gas burns cleaner than coal, gas operations leak methane, which has a more potent effect on atmospheric warming than carbon dioxide, though it makes up a smaller percentage of total greenhouse-gas emissions.
Investors, policy makers and buyers of liquefied natural gas are rethinking the fuel's role in their energy mix because of concerns about methane emissions, which were highlighted this week as a significant contributor to climate change by a scientific panel working under the auspices of the United Nations. Those concerns, pronounced in Europe and increasingly in Asia, are a problem for LNG shippers, as some of their customers signal plans to ease gas consumption over time.
In a policy draft last month, Japanese regulators said the country would have LNG make up 20% of its projected power generation by 2030, down from a prior target of 27%. The European Union has been weighing how to pressure LNG shippers to cut emissions. It could include LNG among the imports subject to a recently proposed carbon border tax.
Nearly every industry faces some pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, as investors focus more on environmental, social and governance issues and push companies for trustworthy emissions data. But the pressure has become particularly acute for oil-and-gas companies, whose main products contribute directly to climate change.
Producing, transporting and ultimately burning one metric ton of LNG releases the greenhouse-gas equivalent of about 3.4 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to a U.K. government estimate, about a quarter of which are emitted before the fuel reaches a power plant.
Though the world is now devouring natural gas as economies emerge from the pandemic, shale executives said keeping U.S. supplies competitive will require companies to corral leaks from wells, processing facilities, pipelines and the export plants before tankers carry it around the world. The tricky part, they said, is proving to skeptics they are doing so.
Cheniere, the largest U.S. LNG exporter, this summer began leading a joint effort with EQT, the largest gas producer, and four other producers including Pioneer Natural Resources Co., to figure out the most effective way to monitor methane emissions.
Over six months, the companies and researchers plan to test drones, cameras that can see methane gas, and other technologies across about 100 wells in the Marcellus Shale in the northeast U.S., the Haynesville Shale of East Texas and Louisiana, and the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico.
The goal is to collect methane-emissions data and see how it stacks up against current estimates from U.S. environmental regulators, which critics consider overly conservative as their underlying data isn't based on continuous measurements. The companies will then decide which technology is the most effective when deployed on a larger scale for continuous monitoring of methane leaks, and which ways to best cut emissions.
EQT has said it would spend $20 million over the next few years to replace leaky pneumatic devices, which help move fluids from wells to production facilities and water tanks, with electric-drive valves, executives said. They expect that will cut about 80% of the company's methane emissions. The company also began exclusively using electric-powered hydraulic fracturing equipment last year.
Cheniere delivered what it called its first carbon-neutral cargo to Royal Dutch Shell PLC in Europe in April, by purchasing carbon offsets from Shell. It plans to provide customers next year with data on emissions tied to each shipment it sends from its two Gulf Coast export facilities. That data, contained in Cheniere's cargo emissions tags, will be based on its analysis of emissions from its supply chain.
The LNG shipper expects its analysis will show a range of emissions from gas producers, pipelines and exporters, but that emissions from the gas it gathers will be comparatively low, said Anatol Feygin, Cheniere's chief commercial officer.

State Jurisdiction
Ruling Not Retroactive
The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals found a U.S. Supreme Court ruling limiting state jurisdiction for crimes committed on tribal reservations by or against tribal citizens doesn't apply retroactively.
The ruling on Thursday could affect hundreds of state convictions that the court previously overturned, many of which resulted in federal charges and convictions, including murder convictions.
Oklahoma inmates who thought they would get a new trial in federal court based on the July 2020 decision known as McGirt, including some on death row, could remain in state prison with their sentences upheld.
"Exercising our independent state law authority to interpret the remedial scope of the state post-conviction statutes, we now hold that McGirt, and our post-McGirt decisions . . . shall not apply retroactively to void a conviction that was final when McGirt was decided," Judge David Lewis wrote.
Federal convictions wouldn't be affected, according to Northern District of Oklahoma Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristin Harrington.

LOS ANGELES
Spears' Father to Exit
Her Conservatorship
Britney Spears' father said he would step down from the helm of the conservatorship that has governed the pop star's personal life and roughly $60 million estate for the last 13 years.
The court documents, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday, come weeks after the 39-year-old star asked a judge presiding over the case to remove her father, James P. Spears, calling the conservatorship "abusive."
A new lawyer for Ms. Spears, Mathew Rosengart, has moved aggressively in recent weeks to remove or suspend Mr. Spears. It is part of a broader effort to terminate the conservatorship over Ms. Spears, an obscure legal arrangement that has been in place since 2008 when it was instituted for her protection due to mental-health issues and potential substance abuse. Ms. Spears has acknowledged its necessity at the time.
Mr. Spears maintained there were "no actual grounds for suspending or removing" him, but said he "does not believe a public battle with his daughter over his continuing service as her conservator would be in her best interests."
Mr. Rosengart, the lawyer for Ms. Spears, praised the move in a written statement. "It is vindication for Britney," he wrote.

CALIFORNIA
Cannabis Is Illegal for
Inmates, Court Says
Prison inmates can't legally possess marijuana under California's law allowing recreational pot, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday in overturning a lower court that found prisoners could have the drug as long as they didn't consume it.
The justices said the 2019 appellate court ruling allowing prisoners to have up to 1 ounce of marijuana went against common sense. The Supreme Court sided with the state attorney general in finding the state's marijuana law approved by voters didn't apply to Californians in prison.
"It seems implausible" that the voters intended to essentially decriminalize marijuana in prisons, Associate Justice Joshua Groban wrote for the majority.
California in 1996 became the first state to legalize medical marijuana, and 20 years later voters approved Proposition 64 establishing the world's largest legal recreational pot marketplace. People 21 or older can legally possess up to an ounce of marijuana.

WASHINGTON
Gates Makes Pledge
For Climate Projects
Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates said his climate investment fund will commit $1.5 billion for joint projects with the U.S. government if Congress enacts a program aimed at developing technologies that lower carbon emissions.
A roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed by the Senate this week would give the Energy Department $25 billion for demonstration projects funded through public-private partnerships, part of more than $100 billion to address climate change. The House hasn't yet approved the legislation.
Mr. Gates, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, said a fund run by his Breakthrough Energy could spend the money over three years on projects aimed at slowing the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause climate change. The Breakthrough projects would have to compete with other applicants for the funds.

Full text: BlackRock Inc. and other heavyweight investors were more willing to flex their muscles against companies in the past year, setting the stage for future showdowns over issues from board seats to climate-change disclosure.
BlackRock funds withheld support from 10% of directors on company shareholder ballots, or more than 6,500 director election proposals, in the year ended in June.
That is up from 8.5% in the prior year. In addition, the world's largest asset manager increased support for shareholder-led proposals. It backed 64% of environmental proposals, up from 11% during the prior year.
BlackRock cast votes alongside other big investors in signature shareholder battles that forced companies to make changes.
Earlier this year, BlackRock, Vanguard Group and California pension funds joined others in backing dissident directors at one of America's most-prominent companies, Exxon Mobil Corp. It was the culmination of yearslong frustration over the oil company's handling of shareholder feedback.
"There have been subtle but significant shifts at the largest institutions to be more assertive," said Rich Fields, who heads Russell Reynolds Associates' board-effectiveness practice. "The implication is there's going to be more of this."
Investors have flooded into index-tracking funds in the past decade in hopes of getting broader access to the market at a lower cost. One unintended consequence of the index funds' rise has been the huge voting power these firms have accumulated as they have added assets. Funds of BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors collectively held nearly 20% of the S&P 500 at the end of March, according to FactSet. They are among the largest shareholders of many companies.
How they wield this power for their millions of investors -- or refrain from doing so -- has far-reaching effects across corporations.
Fund managers' willingness to exert power in more-visible ways emboldened other investors to take on companies, too. This year was particularly noteworthy as the Covid-19 pandemic revealed flaws in how companies navigated economic upheaval, supply-chain challenges and restive workforces. More boards failed to secure strong approval ratings.
Across Russell 3000 companies, 6% of proposals involving company-supported board candidates fell short of 80% shareholder support, according to Insightia data for the year ended in June. That is the highest level of companies failing to draw this level of support in at least four years and up from 4.3% in 2018.
Casting "no" votes or withholding support from directors are the most direct ways to express dissent. Directors who don't win a majority vote typically must leave. Those with less than 80% of votes are vulnerable.
"It's a red flag for companies -- and it's shark bait for activist investors," said Andrew Freedman, co-chairman of the shareholder-activism group at the law firm Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP.
As index firms are involved in new activist battles, they face competing pressures. Activist investors, special-interest groups and politicians have pushed these funds to do more on social issues, from climate change to gender rights. They are targets of public pressure campaigns and lobbying by environmentalist and progressive groups.
Some politicians have accused index firms of overreach. Two Republican senators expressed concern that BlackRock and State Street were emphasizing their chief executive officers' "personal policy views over retirees' financial security" when making shareholder voting decisions for the nation's biggest 401(k)-type plan.
The fund managers have said they vote solely to fulfill responsibilities to investors.
Index funds can't sell companies at random and avoid interfering in corporations' daily business. They say that private discussions are the main way to convey expectations to companies they are invested in for the long haul and that they only cast votes to maximize shareholder value.
For BlackRock, the rise in votes against directors reflected stricter expectations on board independence in Asia, concerns about pay packages in a pandemic year and what it perceived as insufficient action around climate issues.
The team driving votes at BlackRock supported 35% of shareholder-led proposals in the 2021 proxy year, up from 17% during the period a year earlier. This capped Sandy Boss's first full year leading interactions with companies on behalf of the firm. BlackRock's new head of investment stewardship has made it clear that backing shareholder proposals is no longer a last resort.
Blue-chip investors' embrace of shareholder proposals validates what started as a fringe movement driven by retirees, nuns and environmentalists. Today, more proposals directly address what investors consider material financial risks. Vanguard, the world's second-largest money manager, tweaked voting guidelines and articulated that its funds would be likely to support proposals for disclosure on workforce diversity and how U.S. companies deal with climate risks.
Vanguard explicitly warned that its funds could vote against directors who weren't demonstrating enough changes needed for board diversity or attention to environmental and social risks. In 2020, Vanguard named John Galloway, who worked for the Obama administration, to head investor stewardship. Vanguard's votes for all of the 2021 proxy period will be disclosed later in the year.
After Tyson Foods Inc. plants were hit by Covid-19 infections, BlackRock and Vanguard backed a proposal that called on the meat supplier to assess human rights and worker safety. While the proposal didn't pass, it demonstrated that big investors are paying attention to the issue.
A Tyson spokesman said the company is committed to dialogue with investors and gives priority to workforce safety. It has ordered all U.S. employees to get Covid-19 vaccinations.
In other votes, Vanguard helped oust the chairman and bring about a broader shake-up at Toshiba Corp., the Japanese conglomerate hit by accounting scandals. BlackRock voted to keep the chairman for stability, voting against other directors it considered more responsible for missteps.
The art of splitting the vote is keeping bankers and advisers busy. After years of being dismissed as board lackeys, those hired to help companies survive shareholder vote season are gaining clout and seeing bonuses multiply from having the attention of CEOs.
Meanwhile, votes by the biggest managers continue to bring attention to their growing power.
BlackRock's voting record for this year reflects new policies, but executives at the firm don't expect its funds' votes against companies to rise as sharply in coming years.
The firm is evaluating new ways to give more of its large investors voting power, people familiar with the matter said.

Full text: Sustainability and Adaptation Directors
Weather and climate change pose a threat to the integrity of educational facilities, which are often old and in need of repair, and could negatively affect the health of students, according to a 2017 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. Storms, floods, downed electric wires and chemical hazard spillovers could increasingly disrupt student learning.
School districts could hire sustainability and adaptation directors to address these concerns, says Laura Schifter, a senior fellow with the energy and environment program at the Aspen Institute. They would focus on reducing school districts' carbon footprint, mapping out the climate risks to facilities and developing contingency strategies. This position would require a degree in sustainability management and knowledge about climate adaptation, she says.
These leaders could push for technologies like solar panels and electric buses, Ms. Schifter says. They would develop plans for learning in the event of a natural disaster.
This position would require knowing how to navigate federal and state programs and apply for funding, says Gilbert Rosas, an energy education specialist at Stockton Unified School District in California. "I do believe that that's the way of the future -- to look at all the climate change adjustments."
Anti-Cheating Czars
As the Covid-19 pandemic and school closures sent students online, educational institutions reported an uptick in cheating. Pressure to perform amid the pandemic stress, lack of oversight and a misunderstanding of what constitutes cheating could explain this increase, says Bonni Behrend, an assistant professor in counseling at Missouri State University and co-author of a forthcoming study on pandemic cheating.
In the coming years, schools could recruit deans to foster academic integrity in students, educate them on plagiarism and identify the new ways they cheat, says Teddi Fishman, a former director of the International Center for Academic Integrity, a nonprofit that combats cheating and plagiarism in higher education.
Good candidates would have a background in psychology and a solid understanding of how students find and use information in the age of TikTok and Instagram. "Students might well not understand the boundaries between quoting, paraphrasing and summarizing, or how to indicate authorship when no author is identified or noted," Dr. Fishman says.
These educators would need to be aware of the latest cheating techniques, she says. Educators could team up with student bodies similar to that at the private Stetson University in Florida, where an honor system council educates peers on academic integrity and adjudicates cases of academic dishonesty, she says.
Agents for College Athletes
College athletes are getting a chance to cash in on their talent. The Supreme Court ruled in June that the National Collegiate Athletic Association's long standing rules limiting the benefits colleges can offer athletes violate U.S. antitrust law. State laws allowing students to profit off their fame have begun to take effect.
With this new opportunity comes new challenges for students, says Karen Weaver, the academic director of the Collegiate Athletics for Senior Leaders program at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education. How do college athletes build their brands? How can they maximize their peak earning years while also making the most of their education?
Athletes will likely see a need for professional agents that help them negotiate sponsorship deals, says Dr. Weaver, ideally former college athletes who can help students as they juggle sports and education. Agents will need to be well-versed in online personal branding, since digital platforms are where most athletes will market themselves. Agents could help their clients broker deals with colleges -- for instance, getting a university to pay for a law school degree later on, Dr. Weaver says.
Good advisers will help athletes build their wealth beyond college sports by identifying other fruitful business avenues, like media deals and entrepreneurial ventures.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package with broad bipartisan support Tuesday, advancing a central piece of President Biden's economic agenda that would amount to one of the most substantial federal investments in roads, bridges and rail in decades.
With 19 Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, joining all 50 members in the Democratic caucus to pass the bill 69 to 30, the legislation sailed through the Senate. The bill faces a more complicated path in the House, where Democrats have yoked the fate of the infrastructure measure to the passage of a broad $3.5 trillion antipoverty and climate effort.
A bipartisan group of 10 senators and the White House hashed out the infrastructure agreement over weeks of painstaking negotiations. It both reauthorizes spending on existing federal public-works programs and pours an additional $550 billion into water projects, the electrical grid and safety efforts, among many other initiatives.
Lawmakers and presidents of both parties have said for years that they wanted to come together on a major package on infrastructure, though an agreement eluded them. The Senate vote on Tuesday puts Mr. Biden on track to buck that trend.
"After years and years of 'infrastructure week,' we're on the cusp of an infrastructure decade that I believe will transform America," said Mr. Biden, a Democrat.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has said the chamber won't take up the infrastructure bill until the Senate also passes the antipoverty and climate plan. That negotiation is challenging on its own and could take months, given uniform GOP opposition and Democratic divisions over its specifics.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) launched the chamber into considering a budget outline for that $3.5 trillion proposal immediately after passing the infrastructure plan Tuesday. An initial procedural motion passed 50 to 49, entirely along party lines.
"To my colleagues who are concerned that this does not do enough on climate, for families, and making corporations and the rich pay their fair share: We are moving onto a second track, which will make a generational transformation in these areas," Mr. Schumer said of the infrastructure bill and the antipoverty plan.
Many senators cheered the public-works legislation as a boon to the economy and as evidence that Republicans and Democrats can still work together on major legislation in Washington.
"It's an issue where traditionally Republicans and Democrats have been able to come together and say, 'We may disagree on taxes and healthcare and all sorts of other things, but on this issue of having strong infrastructure, we can come together,'" said Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, the lead GOP negotiator of the deal.
Of that $550 billion in spending above previously projected federal levels, $110 billion would go toward roads and bridges, $66 billion to rail and nearly $40 billion to public transit. A $65 billion infusion would fund expanded access to broadband, including by providing low-income households a $30 monthly voucher to pay for internet service.
The bill includes several measures aimed at avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, with $65 billion allocated for improving the electrical grid and energy production and nearly $50 billion set aside for making infrastructure more resilient to both cyberattacks and natural disasters like floods and wildfires.
About $7.5 billion is dedicated to building additional charging stations for electric vehicles, while another $7.5 billion would help fund swapping out current school buses and ferries with lower-emission replacements.
"This bill will rebuild crumbling roads and bridges and tunnels across the country. It will provide clean drinking water in American homes and address harmful contaminants. It will increase connectivity in our communities to bring broadband to even the most rural parts of our country," said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), one of the lawmakers who crafted the plan.
The exact infrastructure projects that the huge infusion of federal funds will benefit will largely be decided by states, according to Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. That flexibility has drawn some criticism from progressives, who pushed for more stringent climate standards on the funds.
"What we would say is that this money doesn't come with enough strings. It's too much of a blank check to states, and there's a history that suggests they're not great at making smart decisions with federal dollars," Mr. DeGood said.
R. Richard Geddes, the director of Cornell University's Program in Infrastructure Policy, said the legislation could have included more provisions facilitating long-term private investments in infrastructure projects. Still, Mr. Geddes, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said the breadth of investments would benefit the economy. "It's certainly historic in infrastructure terms. It's at least a once-in-a-generation bill," he said.
Negotiators struggled for weeks to agree on how to raise funds or find savings to cover the full cost of the package, a goal of both Republicans and Democrats in the talks. The White House ruled out raising the federal gas tax or other similar fees on those who use infrastructure, which have historically been sources of funds for infrastructure spending. Republicans opposed Mr. Biden's plan to raise corporate taxes to cover the cost.
To meet both those demands, the Republican and Democratic negotiators decided to rely on repurposing existing Covid-19 funds, delaying a Trump-era rule on Medicare rebates and receiving funds from past and future auction sales of wireless-spectrum space. A series of accounting maneuvers, along with applying reporting requirements to cryptocurrency transactions, are also meant to defray the bill's overall cost.
The Congressional Budget Office, the legislative branch's nonpartisan scorekeeper, found that lawmakers' payment efforts came up short, projecting that the package would add $256 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.
The negotiators said they disagreed with the CBO's methods for reaching that conclusion.
Republicans who opposed the bill cited its cost and relationship to the rest of the Democratic agenda as reasons. "I'm not yet comfortable with the current pay-fors in this legislation nor am I comfortable with Speaker Pelosi's continued insistence on tying passage of this bill to the Democrats' $3.5 trillion reckless tax-and-spend budget proposal," Sen. Todd Young (R., Ind.) said.
Agreeing not to raise taxes on businesses as part of the bill wasn't the only concession Mr. Biden made during the talks. The White House originally sought a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan in the spring, proposing major investments like $400 billion to cover in-home care for elderly and disabled people and $213 billion for retrofitting and building affordable housing that aren't in the bipartisan package.
Other White House initiatives, like spending $45 billion to replace lead pipes or $20 billion to reconnect neighborhoods cut off by past transportation projects, were slimmed down in the bipartisan bill. The legislation provides $15 billion for replacing lead pipes and $1 billion for the neighborhood program.
Democrats might pursue some of those excluded measures, like the care for elderly and disabled people and raising the corporate tax rate, in the separate $3.5 trillion package. Democrats plan to approve that bill through a budget process called reconciliation, which would allow them to pass it without GOP support.

Full text: The U.K. set one of the most ambitious carbon emission-reduction targets among major economies, making the country a case study in how climate goals call for big shifts in policy, the economy and technology.
Britain is one of several heavy polluters including the U.S., China and the European Union to unveil emission plans in the run-up to the United Nations climate conference in Scotland this fall.
In a bid to establish the U.K.'s environmental bona fides ahead of the conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 78% from 1990 levels by 2035. How Britain fares, having already made deeper cuts than other G-20 economies, will offer the U.S. and other countries clues about the steps needed. Here are the five things the U.K. is focused on:
Electricity Generation
Cleaning up power generation is key because climate plans in the U.K. and elsewhere depend on electrifying swaths of the economy. The U.K. made quick progress on this: Wind power provided about 25% of electricity in 2020.
The next step, according to the Climate Change Committee -- a panel of external advisers that guides and reports on the government's efforts to get to net zero -- is to generate electricity from entirely low-carbon sources by 2035. That will require billions of dollars to finance offshore-wind farms.
Fierce competition is under way to dominate the offshore-wind market, pitting early movers such as Denmark's Orsted AS, Norway's Equinor ASA and U.K. utility SSE PLC against newer entrants including BP.
Power Storage and Transmission
The wind doesn't always blow, so storing electricity will be crucial, said Robert Gross, a professor of energy policy and technology at Imperial College London. Some of the technology needed to do this, such as pumping water uphill with electricity before releasing it to drive a turbine, has been in use for decades. Other technologies, such as batteries, are being developed or remain commercially unviable on an industrial scale.
Transportation
Cars and other forms of surface transportation are the biggest source of emissions in the U.K. The country must quickly convert its fleet to run on electricity, according to the government's advisers.
So far this year, fully electric cars accounted for 8.1% of the market. Vehicles made by Tesla, Nissan Motor Co. and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC are the most popular. The U.K. would need to expand its network of public charging points by more than 10 times by 2030.
Buildings
Another source of emissions that the U.K. has largely failed to plug comes from buildings. Reducing these will depend on insulation and draft-proofing, and on moving from natural-gas boilers to alternative sources of heat. The need to re-equip millions of homes could be a moneymaker for utilities such as Centrica PLC, investors say. Mortgage lenders such as NatWest Group PLC are looking to see if they can offer financial incentives to make homes more efficient.
Carbon Capture and Hydrogen
Hitting the U.K.'s longer-run target of net-zero emissions by 2050 would involve cleaning up sectors such as manufacturing and construction. Doing so would partly rely on less-established technologies such as using hydrogen to fire furnaces and kilns, and on capturing and storing carbon.
One big company pinning its hopes on carbon capture is Drax Group PLC, which produces about 6% of the U.K.'s electricity.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats released an outline of the $3.5 trillion antipoverty and climate plan on Monday, further detailing their ambitions for a major overhaul of the nation's education and healthcare systems that they hope to advance alongside a bipartisan infrastructure bill.
The antipoverty plan would offer universal prekindergarten, two free years of community college, and expanded Medicare to cover hearing, dental and vision care, among other provisions.
Democrats will turn to it after the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package, which includes new spending on roads, bridges, transit and broadband internet and is expected to pass the Senate on Tuesday. Lawmakers said they had resolved a dispute over a new cryptocurrency regulation in the public-works bill, though the solution may not receive an amendment vote.
The two packages represent almost the entirety of President Biden's economic agenda, with Democrats shoehorning a variety of policy goals into the $3.5 trillion plan to sidestep Republican opposition in the Senate.
To cover the cost, Democrats are seeking to raise taxes on corporations and high-income households. The plan outlined by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Monday also includes offering a pathway to lawful permanent status for certain migrants to the U.S. and lowering the price of prescription drugs. It calls for a federal paid-leave benefit, a series of energy tax incentives and a program to push the U.S. to receive 80% of its electricity from clean sources by 2030.
The legislation could "give tens of millions of families a leg up," Mr. Schumer wrote in a letter to Senate Democrats Monday morning.
Republicans have assailed the proposal, arguing its tax increases and expansive spending would harm the economy. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) on Monday decried "trillions more spending when inflation is already sticking American families with higher costs."
Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee had previously reached an agreement on the $3.5 trillion top-line figure, with the additional materials released Monday providing a broader list of the party's hopes for the package. The release of the budget outline will also allow Democrats to begin the formal process for writing and approving the bill.
Deciding on the specifics of the tax increases -- as well as the duration and design of the spending proposals -- will be one of several major choices Democrats will still need to make in the coming weeks as they craft the bill.
Additional provisions in the blueprint are efforts to create more affordable housing, investments in technology and climate-change research and potentially lowering the Medicare eligibility age.
The outline doesn't include a measure to increase the U.S. government's borrowing limit. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday that Congress should raise the debt limit on a bipartisan basis.
Congress voted in July 2019 to suspend the debt limit until July 31, 2021, as part of a deal brokered by Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). The Treasury uses emergency accounting maneuvers to conserve cash so the government can keep paying its obligations to bondholders, Social Security recipients, veterans and others, but those measures are expected to run out in the fall.
Republicans have said Democrats shouldn't expect any GOP help with the debt limit and should raise the debt limit themselves as part of the broader plan.
While Democrats could amend the budget plan to include a debt-limit increase, the more likely path is that the issue is addressed in September, according to a person familiar with the matter.
One idea Democrats are considering is a stand-alone vote to suspend the debt limit, the person said, which could put pressure on Republicans to support the measure or risk rattling financial markets if the vote fails. Lawmakers could also attach the measure to another must-pass bill, like government funding, to force the issue.
Mr. Schumer said the Senate will take up the budget plan after it wraps up the infrastructure bill. He has said that the Senate won't break for its August recess until it has passed both the infrastructure plan and the budget outline for the $3.5 trillion plan.

Full text: Rising seas, melting ice caps and other effects of a warming climate might be irreversible for centuries and are "unequivocally" driven by greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity, a scientific panel working under the auspices of the United Nations said Monday in a new report.
World leaders -- especially those from the West and island nations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change -- deemed the report a call to action ahead of international climate negotiations scheduled for November. Many called for cutbacks in fossil-fuel consumption, which the report identifies as a leading driver of the rise in levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
"The impacts of the climate crisis, from extreme heat to wildfires to intense rainfall and flooding, will only continue to intensify unless we choose another course for ourselves and generations to come," U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said. "What the world requires now is real action."
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson singled out the burning of coal, saying the world should "consign [it] to history."
Issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization of 195 governments, the new report is drawn from a three-year analysis of 14,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies. It is the first major international assessment of climate-change research since 2013.
The report highlights human responsibility for record heat waves, droughts, more intense storms and other extreme weather events seen around the world in recent years. It also sharpens estimates of how sensitive the climate is to rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases -- a key metric in forecasting the rise of global temperatures in the years ahead.
"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land," the report says. "Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe."
The report is likely to be a major force in both geopolitics and business. It sets scientific baselines and offers guidance to negotiators regularly convened by the U.N. under the Paris Climate Agreement, which has become a benchmark for corporate as well as governmental efforts to curb emissions.
The next major climate negotiations, known as COP26 and scheduled to begin in Glasgow on Nov. 1, will bring together representatives from nearly every nation in the world to discuss new, more ambitious commitments for cutting emissions. Mr. Kerry has said the U.S. and other countries must use the talks to speed their efforts because those taken so far are failing to make the progress that scientific research says is necessary within about a decade.
The report ties the types of extreme weather events seen in recent weeks -- historic heat waves in the Pacific Northwest, torrential floods in Europe and China, and forest fires in the U.S., Russia and elsewhere -- directly to climate change.
"We've known for decades that the world is warming, but this report tells us that recent changes in the climate are widespread, rapid and intensifying, unprecedented in thousands of years," said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and the senior adviser for climate at the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "Further, it is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change."
The report "connects the dots in a way we really haven't seen before," said climate scientist Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, who wasn't involved with the report. "The message eerily resonates with what we're seeing this summer in Canada, the U.S. and Europe as extreme weather events play havoc on us and our infrastructure."
Levels of carbon dioxide released into the air by the burning of fossil fuels, cement production and deforestation and other land-use changes reached a modern seasonal high of 419 parts per million in May. That is higher than at any time in the past 3.6 million years, according to NOAA.
Atmospheric levels of methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas, are now about 2 1/2 times their preindustrial levels and steadily rising, according to the International Energy Agency.
In Glasgow, representatives from almost 200 countries are expected to present updated plans for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. They are working under a global agreement resulting from the 2015 Paris climate summit that called on nations to take steps to limit future global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
"This report tells us that we probably need even more action by all the major economies to work together to avoid even worse impacts than we're already seeing now," said Jane Lubchenco, deputy director for climate and the environment at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. She wasn't involved in the IPCC effort.
Greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity have raised global temperatures by 1.1 degrees Celsius since around 1850, the report said. Without rapid reductions in emissions, global temperatures could rise more than an additional 1.5 degrees Celsius over the next 20 years, the report forecasts.
Last year, global temperatures tied for the warmest on record, capping the warmest decade in modern times. Oceans are warming, and sea level is increasing by 3.7 mm, or about 0.1 inch, a year, the scientists said in the report. Mountain glaciers, sea ice and polar ice sheets are steadily melting. Weather around the world has grown more extreme by many measures, the scientists said, with more frequent heat waves and prolonged droughts in some regions and heavier rainfall and flooding in others.
"When you see what has happened this summer with heat waves in Canada and the heavy precipitation in Germany, I think this is showing that even highly developed countries are not spared," said Sonia Seneviratne, a senior scientist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and a lead co-author of the report. "We don't really have time to adapt anymore because the change is happening so quickly."

Full text: A cold snap in Texas earlier this year shut down refineries and chemical plants. Drought in Taiwan continues to put pressure on semiconductor manufacturing capacity. And in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, businesses are still recovering from losses as a result of recent record high temperatures.
The increased frequency and severity of natural catastrophes has sparked a growing industry of climate-analytics companies that aim to help businesses gauge both short- and long-term threats.
Weather and climate forecasting services have existed for decades, but historic climate data is proving to be less effective in helping to predict future events. There have been eight extreme events in 2021 with losses exceeding $1 billion as of July 9. In all of 1980 there were three, adjusting for inflation, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
More than 8,000 suppliers of goods and services to large corporations reported that $1.26 trillion of their revenue is likely at risk over the next five years because of climate change, deforestation and water security, according to a report by CDP, a nonprofit platform for corporate environmental disclosures.
These new climate-analytics companies combine troves of historical and current data with sophisticated artificial-technology techniques and systems, including neural networks, to help account for the increasing velocity of events linked to climate change.
Westchester Group Investment Management, an investment arm of asset manager Nuveen LLC, was looking to invest in farmland growing a particular crop across Spain and Portugal and worked with San Francisco-based ClimateAi Inc.
The startup, which was founded in 2017 and trains its climate-risk system on the long-range global climate models, found that climate over the next few years wouldn't be optimal for the crop's success, said Martin Davies, WGIM's president and chief executive.
"It is essential for climate hazard assessment and adaptation to become the 'new normal' in corporate, investor and government decision-making," said Mekala Krishnan, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute. "Added to this is the increasing call from stakeholders -- including the public, regulators and investors -- for transparency from companies on their climate risk exposure."
Investors are paying attention to such companies. Japanese insurance holdings company Sompo Holdings Inc. in June invested $45 million in Menlo Park, Calif.-based One Concern Inc. The same month, private-equity firm TPG's Rise Fund invested $100 million in Louisville, Ky.-based Climavision Operating LLC. More recently, ClimateAi said on July 21 it raised $12 million in venture-capital funding.
Climate intelligence startups differ in their approaches, but, for the most part, use machine learning to analyze hordes of data, recognize patterns and make local forecasts about specific places or events, according to Himanshu Gupta, ClimateAi's chief executive.
Many also use neural networks, systems composed of various layers of artificial neurons designed to mimic the way a human brain works.

Full text: Exxon Mobil Corp. is considering a pledge to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would amount to a significant strategic shift by the oil company.
In March 2020, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods described ambitious carbon-reduction targets made by some European rivals as nothing more than a "beauty competition," saying the pledges lacked tangible plans to achieve them.
Mr. Woods and others on Exxon's board are now giving the same idea serious debate, the people said. Mr. Woods is facing pressure from investors to demonstrate a bolder path to reducing emissions.
Following a bruising proxy fight this year, an activist hedge fund elected three new members to the company's board.
The Irving, Texas, company hasn't made a final decision on a "net-zero" pledge, according to the people. It plans to unveil a series of strategic moves on environmental and other issues before the end of the year, they said.
Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said the company is committed to working to decarbonize high-emitting sectors, and backs regulation that would spur that. "As the board goes through its deliberations regarding future plans related to the company's energy transition activities, we routinely evaluate our work and commitments," he said.
Mr. Woods has said Exxon supports the goals of the Paris climate agreement, an international accord that aims to limit the increase in the global average temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees. He has stopped short of committing Exxon to a net-zero plan.
To date, Exxon has instead pledged to reduce its so-called carbon intensity, or emissions as a proportion of total energy produced. It is unclear exactly what a new Exxon net-zero pledge would entail, but what is being considered would apply to the emissions directly produced by Exxon's assets and stemming from the energy the company uses, the people said. That is known in climate disclosure as scope 1 and 2 emissions.
There is no standard definition for how companies define net-zero emissions, and specifics often vary, which has led some to dismiss the pledges as exercises in modern-day image management. Such goals generally aim to reduce a company's carbon footprint to neutral in the future.
Exxon lost three seats on its board of directors at its annual shareholder meeting in May to the hedge fund Engine No. 1, which argued that the oil company needs to act faster to remake itself and invest in clean energy.
Senior executives within the company now believe it must act urgently to refine its strategy to navigate the energy transition, and some of Exxon's largest shareholders have told executives recently that they need to set more- ambitious climate-change targets or risk further alienating investors, the people said.
Meanwhile, some on Exxon's board have expressed support for a carbon-neutrality pledge, according to the people. In particular, Alexander Karsner, one of the Engine No. 1 candidates elected to Exxon's board and an executive at Alphabet Inc.'s innovation lab, has pressed Mr. Woods to reposition the company to address climate change, the people said.
In a virtual board meeting in July, Mr. Karsner suggested to Mr. Woods that Exxon hadn't acted quickly enough to reduce its emissions, in an exchange that some of the people described as contentious.
Some of the other new directors also have doubts regarding Mr. Woods's strategy for Exxon, said people familiar with the matter. Mr. Woods has focused on trying to bring the new board members into the fold, holding candid discussions about what needs to change, some of the people said.
Exxon has for years evaluated investing in renewable energy, biofuels and other technologies, including carbon capture and storage. In recent conversations with the board, Mr. Woods shared Exxon's energy transition plans, including the path to net zero, said a person familiar with the matter.
After the proxy fight, Exxon has five new board members in total. In addition to the three Engine No. 1 candidates, Exxon appointed two new directors as part of a separate settlement with hedge fund D.E. Shaw.
Last week Exxon held its first in-person board meeting since the new directors joined. Mr. Woods described the meeting as encouraging during a call with analysts.
Beginning last year, several large European oil companies including BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC made public commitments to reduce to zero the emissions from their operations and from assets they own but don't operate. Shell also set a net-zero target for emissions from its products.
How companies will achieve such targets is unclear. BP and Shell have begun selling higher-carbon-emitting fossil-fuel assets and investing more in renewable energy. Exxon formed a new business unit in February to invest in lower-emission energy technologies. Initially, it will focus on carbon capture and storage projects, which gather carbon emissions from industrial processes or directly from the air and deposit them underground.
Ramanan Krishnamoorti, chief energy officer at the University of Houston, said Exxon could achieve a net-zero target over the next 30 years without exiting oil and gas production if it deploys large-scale carbon capture and storage projects. But such projects' commercial viability would be contingent on government support and subsidies not in place, he said.

Full text: Moody's Corp., best known for rating corporate and government debt, is diving into disaster and climate-change risk modeling.
The ratings company on Thursday said it had agreed to acquire RMS, a catastrophe risk-management and modeling firm, from its U.K. parent Daily Mail & General Trust PLC for about $2 billion.
The deal is a sign of the big money to be made from selling data that analyzes changing climate patterns caused by global warming. RMS sells data and analytics to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance sectors. It has grown rapidly alongside the increased frequency of natural disasters that are changing the way insurers price coverage.
Moody's said the acquisition would help build its business of providing data and risk assessments to the insurance industry.
On a call with analysts, Moody's Chief Executive Rob Fauber said "climate change is an issue that demands urgent attention." He added thatthe acquisition will help customers manage exposure to climate-change risks in their investment and lending portfolios and meet regulatory requirements related to climate change.
Moody's business of rating debt and other financial risk services has boomed during the pandemic. Its share price rose Thursday to an all-time high, and is up by a third this year, rewarding its biggest shareholder, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Insurers and reinsurers, which traditionally focused on predicting big weather events that can cause widespread damage, such as hurricanes, are increasingly incorporating other models that look at smaller, but more frequent events that cause damage such as hail, drought, wildfire and snow.
"Global risks are now more complex, connected and systemic, said Karen White, chief executive officer of RMS. "Climate change and catastrophic events like extreme weather, pandemics and cyberattacks have broader and more harmful impacts across virtually all industries."
Moody's said RMS expects to generate around $320 million in revenue this fiscal year and runs risk models for 120 countries. Moody's said it would pay for Newark, Calif.-based RMS through a mix of cash and issuing new debt. The deal is expected to close late in the third quarter.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As the Senate moves forward with a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, progressive Democrats are warning party leaders not to take their votes for granted as they try to advance sweeping antipoverty and climate proposals.
The infrastructure bill cleared a key Senate hurdle Wednesday when 17 Republicans joined all Democrats to begin debate of the legislation, and it advanced through another procedural vote Friday. If the bill makes it through the Senate it will head to the House, where party leaders have agreed to tie its fate to a $3.5 trillion antipoverty and healthcare package that Democrats plan to pass without GOP support.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has said she won't bring up the infrastructure package without the antipoverty bill, a stance demanded by progressives to ensure their priorities don't get brushed aside. The party is aiming to steer trillions of dollars in proposed spending through Congress and to President Biden's desk by this fall by keeping on board both its centrist and left flanks, both with powerful leverage due to Democrats' razor-thin majorities.
"We need to be transformative in terms of how we go forward with infrastructure investments and reconciliation bills that truly meet families' needs," said Mrs. Pelosi at a news conference Friday.
The infrastructure agreement is expected to include roughly $550 billion in spending above projected federal levels, with money going to, among other things, bolster roads and bridges, expand rural broadband and improve rail and public transit.
For the remainder of their economic agenda, Democrats are simultaneously preparing another piece of legislation using a budget maneuver called reconciliation that allows for them to pass it without GOP support. That is expected to include paid family and medical leave, broaden Medicare benefits to cover dental, vision and hearing and aim to reduce climate change.
Republicans have dismissed those plans as wasteful spending that could fuel inflation and hobble the economy.
That legislation hasn't been drafted beyond the top-line number and a list of items Democrats have said they would like to see included. Some Democrats in the Senate, where all 50 are needed for passage, have expressed concerns about the $3.5 trillion cost. In response, progressives in the House -- already frustrated they have been left out of the bipartisan infrastructure negotiations -- have warned against cuts to the plan and say their votes shouldn't be taken for granted in the narrowly split House.
This intraparty dispute has started to break into the open. On Wednesday Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a key negotiator on the bipartisan package, said she opposed the cost of the $3.5 trillion figure Democratic leadership had endorsed.
"Good luck tanking your own party's investment on child care, climate action, and infrastructure while presuming you'll survive a 3 vote House margin," Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) tweeted in response.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a key negotiator of the Democrat-only package, warned his colleagues during a meeting this week that they need to back the antipoverty bill because progressives were supporting the infrastructure package. He then called Mrs. Pelosi to tell her he backed her approach of tying the two bills together, according to a person familiar with the matter. The interactions were first reported by Politico.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.), the chair of the roughly 100 person progressive caucus of which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is a member, distributed a statement later Wednesday warning the votes of her members weren't guaranteed.
Ms. Jayapal said Thursday that she was reserving judgment until she sees legislative text of the infrastructure deal.
Meanwhile, some moderate Democrats have said they want to see the infrastructure bill voted on as soon as possible, without waiting for the antipoverty package.
Some House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), say they are encouraged by what they know of the infrastructure deal, but want to see the details on how the spending is paid for to make a decision.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Public companies could be required to disclose risks related to climate change to investors in regulatory filings under a proposal being formulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a step that could expose them to new litigation threats.
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said he has asked agency staff to consider whether climate-related disclosures should be filed in companies' annual reports, known as Form 10-K, along with financial data and other information considered crucial to investors. That would require them to provide statements that are both complete and accurate, making it easier for SEC enforcement attorneys to investigate firms or their directors for fraud or disclosure failures.
While some companies currently provide some information on climate risks, Mr. Gensler said in a speech that those disclosures can be inconsistent and difficult to compare. He likened standardized disclosures to Olympic races.
"It's not like some sprinters run a 100-meter dash and others run 90 meters," he said in a speech to Principles for Responsible Investment. "Investors today are asking for that ability to compare companies with each other. Generally, I believe it's with mandatory disclosures that investors can benefit from that consistency and comparability."
The SEC has broad authority to require disclosures by companies selling securities, and the Biden administration has made addressing climate change a central priority across the federal government. Because climate change doesn't affect every company's bottom line the same way, the planned SEC rules have become politically controversial and have set off a wave of lobbying.
Energy firms, airlines and groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have argued in comments filed to the SEC that the agency should allow climate-related disclosures outside of regulatory filings. They have also called for liability protection for companies as long as they make good-faith efforts to follow the rules.
Advocates of stricter disclosure rules warn that, in the absence of third-party audits and potential liability for company officers, some companies will continue to play down climate-related risks or exaggerate their sustainability efforts.
Companies have increasingly mentioned climate-related risks in their annual reports. For companies, climate change can involve both physical risk, such as extreme weather events, as well as transition risk, which includes government policies that force a move away from fossil fuels.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The American Petroleum Institute, Washington's biggest lobby for the oil-and-gas industry, spent decades leveraging its financial muscle to fight almost every green initiative in its path.
Then in March, the group signaled an about-face. It released its "Climate Action Framework," a set of new policy prescriptions to lower emissions and support cleaner fuels.
The core of the plan called for two policies API had opposed for years: more regulation on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that leaks from oil-and-gas operations, and a price on carbon, a financial penalty levied on all carbon-dioxide emissions.
The challenge of climate change, it said, requires "new approaches, new partners, new policies and continuous innovation."
Even by the standards of Washington, it was a remarkable shift. And it made nobody happy.
Democrats' embrace of alternative energy and skepticism of the oil industry continue unchanged. Republican allies, long a bulwark for the industry, feel alienated. Congress is weighing hundreds of billions of dollars in spending -- some of it to be raised from new fines and tariffs levied on oil-and-gas companies -- that would boost utilities and wind- and solar-power developers.
Within API, the pressure has fanned divisions nearly as old as the oil industry itself. The giants including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp. have demanded API do more to pivot from carbon-intensive fuels and embrace regulation. Many of API's smaller members -- independents and refiners -- see those calls as threats to their business and an attempt by larger members to consolidate market power.
The century-old organization tries to strike consensus among its roughly 600 members, and that has become increasingly difficult as companies diverge over how to respond to concerns over climate change and government actions.
"They're coming from a position of weakness right now," said Trent Lott, a former Republican Senate majority leader, who is now at Washington lobbying firm Crossroads Strategies LLC and has advised on energy policy and carbon taxes, among other issues. "They're being squeezed from all sides."
The organization is being buffeted by a rapid change in sentiment in the wake of the Paris Agreement, an international pact on climate change that went into force in 2016. In addition to the biggest oil producers, onetime industry allies in Detroit and Wall Street have embraced a vision of the future that involves less fossil fuel. And the Democratic Party now controls both Congress and the White House.
How these tensions play out will help determine how the oil industry responds to climate change initiatives and whether API can remain a powerful force helping shape laws and regulations. Several members have threatened to leave API over disagreements about the climate agenda, and one, TotalEnergies SE of France, canceled its membership in January.
So far, the group has stopped further defections, and API says it has added independent members since the carbon pricing plan was announced.
API is a giant among Washington business groups, with $200 million in annual revenue, derived primarily from member dues and its standard-setting and security certification business. It has an extensive global reach with offices in China, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore, according to tax filings. For international companies like BP and Shell with massive U.S. footprints, that makes membership attractive.
Beyond lobbying, API is the industry's arbiter of technical standards, such as specs on pumping equipment and operational standards for deep water wells, which are incorporated into federal and state rules and used as a reference by regulators around the world. Its services division certifies drilling equipment, gas station safety protocols and motor oil.
For years, API used its clout to fight a growing environmental lobby. It blunted an attempt to tighten ozone pollution standards. It helped overturn a ban on oil exports, and it forestalled measures to create regulatory limits on emissions of methane.
Most prominently, it helped scuttle a 2009 bill known as Waxman-Markey, the last ambitious attempt by Congress to limit greenhouse gas emissions by levying a cost on emissions.
By the time President Donald Trump came to power in 2017 with a deregulatory agenda for the oil industry, the pressure to embrace a climate agenda was coming from businesses, the finance industry and some API members themselves.
European oil companies, in particular, faced public and political pressure to change. Exxon Mobil, the biggest U.S. oil company by market value, often sided with the Europeans. When Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris accord, Exxon said publicly it was the wrong move.
"It's a different era," said Daniel Yergin, an energy industry historian. "API and the whole industry [are] facing challenges and pressures they've never faced before."
A year later, in June 2018, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods met with Pope Francis at the Vatican to affirm that the company wants to be "part of the solution" on climate change.
Exxon's leadership had in prior years decided a price on carbon was the better alternative to potentially more prescriptive rules. Smaller members viewed the motives of the larger members with suspicion.
Leaders at Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum Corp., which operates the nation's largest refining system, complained to API that more regulation would likely eventually lead to higher prices they would have to charge their customers at the pump.
The more Exxon and other big companies advocated for green policies, especially a carbon tax, the more frustration grew at Marathon. Its chief executive at the time, Gary Heminger, saw a bias within API against refiners and he suggested several times he would consider pulling Marathon out of the group, say people who heard his remarks.
Mr. Heminger, who is now retired, said he doesn't recall all his conversations with API, but said he didn't suggest Marathon would leave the organization.
"That's playground talk to say if you don't do it my way we're going to drop out," he said. "I wouldn't do that."
A company spokesman declined to comment on the prospect of Marathon leaving.
The major oil companies felt their own pressure. Faced with a campaign from environmental groups and concern about climate change within its European team, Shell began a review of whether to leave API. Several companies including Exxon and BP joined a new business group advocating for a carbon-tax system to help reduce emissions. TotalEnergies began reformulating its business to transition from oil into electricity, especially zero-emissions power, changing its name this year from Total SA to reflect the overhaul.
In 2018, Mike Sommers, who spent years serving as an aide to former House Speaker John Boehner, arrived at Exxon's Irving, Texas, headquarters, to interview for the top job at API. Seated across a conference room table was API's executive committee, including Messrs. Woods and Heminger, ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance and Chevron Corp.'s Michael Wirth.
They agreed the time had come to address climate change, but each CEO had a different take on how API should do it, according to people familiar with the interview and the companies' views.
Mr. Sommers got the job on a promise to change API's approach to problem solver from attack dog, these people said. To do so, he would need to reach a consensus among his members on climate change.
Total was growing frustrated that API wasn't clearer in supporting the Paris pact. In a frank meeting in his office in December 2019, four years after the agreement was signed, Mr. Sommers told Total executives from Washington that API had to finish its review before it would decide whether to issue a policy explicitly supporting the agreement.
"Mike, it's not enough," Francois Badoual, the company's top official in Washington replied to Mr. Sommers, according to a person familiar with the meeting. "Society is changing and API needs to change. If you don't, you won't be relevant anymore." Total quit API about a year later, citing disagreements on climate policy.
Mr. Sommers, with support from Exxon, sought to address the pressure on API's other European members by giving priority to climate policy. The effort faced repeated backlash from the U.S. refiners, independents and other smaller members.
By 2021, after three years of prodding, Mr. Sommers was on the verge of getting the world's largest oil companies to agree on a plan, including policies on regulating methane emissions. By then, President Biden had won the White House, put the U.S. back in the Paris agreement and was encouraging progressives with talk of addressing climate change.
On a call in late 2020 of an API working committee, members debated the methane policy at length. Mr. Sommers felt he had reached a shaky consensus to support federal regulation. Some members had reservations.
API staffers, thinking Mr. Sommers had left the call, sought to ease concerns by suggesting API might not follow through with the policy.
Mr. Sommers, in fact, hadn't hung up. "Make no mistake," he said sharply, after unmuting his line. "We are doing this."
Mr. Sommers knew he had to manage the fallout among oil-patch partisans on Capitol Hill. He sought to arrange calls with industry supporters in Congress as the API executive committee's final vote neared on the Climate Action Framework.
Staff for Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.), the Republican leader on the Senate energy committee, canceled his call after API announced it would support a price on carbon, which the senator views as a tax.
That grumbling had started weeks earlier. After The Wall Street Journal first reported API was considering such a move, Rep. Garret Graves (R., La.), Republican leader of the House Select Climate Committee, called the proposal "a cop-out approach to appease the radical left."
The left has been equally unimpressed. Environmental activists, and their allies among Democrats, have said they doubt API will follow through with efforts for meaningful change.
"They see a carbon price as something they can manipulate, something they can continue to pollute under, and, potentially, as something that faces too many political headwinds to ever happen," said Sen. Ed Markey (D. Mass.), a House member when he co-sponsored the 2009 legislation.
Mr. Sommers dismissed that charge through a spokesman.
"We are advocating for a carbon price policy as the most impactful way to spur necessary innovation and measurably reduce emissions across all sectors," he said.
Biden administration officials have been wary of API and initially left the organization out of the White House's first meeting with industry leaders in March, according to several people familiar with the meeting. The White House eventually gave Mr. Sommers the last spot on the agenda. Officials doubt the trade group's credibility, given its history of supporting companies slowest to address climate change, according to one of the people.
Several congressional Republicans and their aides say Mr. Sommers retains clout and friends on Capitol Hill. Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton said he opposed API's carbon pricing stance but still considers the organization vital and Mr. Sommers "one of the more skilled and capable [operatives] in Washington."
"The members of Congress I've worked with for decades understand the importance of our industry to their districts and states," Mr. Sommers said. "I know them and they know me, and that's important to our efforts to continue to make connections and advocate for a strong U.S. oil-and-gas sector."
API leaders also point to the final vote on the Climate Action Framework as a show of strength; it passed with unanimous support from the group's executive committee
Companies continue to review their API memberships. BP said this spring that it would remain part of the trade group, at least for now. At Shell's annual shareholder meeting in May, Chief Executive Ben van Beurden acknowledged disagreements but said Shell took some credit for moving the association closer to the goals of the Paris accord.
"For now, we believe we are better off working with and inside the API with the progress that we have made," Mr. van Beurden said. "If at some point in time, we feel that there are irreconcilable differences, and we cannot make any progress anymore, we will have no hesitation to step out of any association."

Full text: HONG KONG -- As floodwaters surged into a stalled subway train beneath the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, Pure Li hurriedly tapped out farewell messages to a close friend on her smartphone. "I may not be able to get out," she wrote.
The 26-year-old engineer was one of more than 500 passengers trapped during the evening rush hour Tuesday, as torrential rains pummeled the central province of Henan. A dozen people wouldn't make it out alive, authorities say, and at least two were still missing as of Sunday.
Desperate images from commuters surrounded by roiling water went viral on Chinese social media this week, striking a nerve in a country that has vastly expanded its subway systems, and suffered a series of serious underground flooding incidents that have raised safety alarms.
On Thursday, China's Ministry of Transportation ordered subway systems nationwide to re-examine and improve contingency plans for extreme weather. Authorities in Zhengzhou, Henan's capital city, and Zhengzhou Metro Group, the state-owned subway company, didn't respond to requests for comment.
As rain fell in Zhengzhou on Tuesday, turning roads into swiftly flowing rivers and causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage, according to state media, water began to pool in a train yard, the metro company said in a statement. It then broke through a wall and flowed into a tunnel.
Ms. Li was heading home at about 5:45 p.m. that day when her train came to an unexpected stop a few hundred yards short of Shakou Road Station in downtown Zhengzhou. The train started to reverse, but it lurched to a stop with a piercing screech. Sparks flew up from the tracks.
Soon after, water started to seep into Ms. Li's car and the train began to tilt to the side.
A little after 6 p.m., the train conductor urged passengers to move to the front of the train, where they could leap over the torrent of water onto a walkway on the side of the tunnel that would lead them to the station's platform.
A number of passengers made their way onto the catwalk before the current grew stronger and it became too dangerous. One group went through the door on the other side of the train and tried to escape by grabbing a cable strung along the tunnel wall and stepping along pipelines attached below.
One of them, Zou Deqiang, slipped onto the tracks and was swept away in a torrent of water in front of a colleague, who continued clinging to the cables and was later rescued, according to Jane Li, owner of the Shanghai-based software company where they worked. Mr. Zou remained missing.
Ms. Li, the engineer who was on the train, said she was nearing the front when the doors closed, so she didn't see the drama.
As more water flowed into the cars, Ms. Li, who had been communicating with a friend through the messaging app WeChat, typed out a quick text: "Screwed."
By 7 p.m., water had reached the ceiling of the cars toward the rear of the train, which had been heading up a slight incline into the station.
The slope design was used here and other parts of the Zhengzhou metro system to make it more energy-efficient for trains to enter and exit stations, according to local media and trade publications. In this instance, it allowed water to fill the tunnel.
The water continued to rise inside Ms. Li's car, reaching her shoulders. Children and some shorter adults climbed onto the seats. Several passengers pulled down face masks and started making calls to police, firefighters, friends and family.
Soon the lights inside the train went out and the ventilation system shut down. Dim emergency lights were all that kept darkness at bay. Some passengers began pressing their faces to cracks between the doors in an effort to find fresh air. Others tried to get close to ventilation holes in the ceiling.
Ms. Li spoke to her cousin at 7:12 p.m., telling him not to tell her mother that she was trapped. "Only tell her if you cannot reach me later," she said.
Water rose to her neck. Ms. Li texted the password to her WeChat account to her friend so that someone would be able to access her data if she died.
"What are you doing?!" her friend replied in panic and told her rescuers had been called.
"Go see my mom for me sometimes," Ms. Li typed. Moments later, she heard a woman elsewhere in the car tell her child to draw close, saying, "Come here baby. Let mom give you a hug."
Fearful that they would run out of air, passengers decided it was worth the risk to break a window.
By the time they broke through, the water level outside the train had begun to drop.
At 8:30 p.m., rescuers arrived outside the train. It took them an hour to crack open the doors. Ms. Li joined others in walking along the narrow walkway to safety.
Soaked and exhausted, Ms. Li fretted about getting home. With the city in the grip of disaster, walking through water-filled streets was the only option, but she worried she might fall into an unseen fissure. Instead, she went to stay with a friend who lived nearby.
Chinese meteorologists attributed the torrential rains in Henan in part to Typhoon In-fa, which hit the east coast south of Shanghai on Sunday, pushing an unusual amount of water vapor into the mountains surrounding Zhengzhou.
While Chinese authorities haven't drawn a direct connection between climate change and the Zhengzhou floods, Liguang Wu, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at Fudan University, said global warming has been shown to increase precipitation from typhoons. Dr. William K.M. Lau, a senior researcher at University of Maryland, went a step further, saying the inundation of Zhengzhou is "consistent with the concept of more extreme weather events under greenhouse warming."

Full text: 'Science" has become a political catchword. "I believe in science," Joe Biden tweeted six days before he was elected president. "Donald Trump doesn't. It's that simple, folks."
But what does it mean to believe in science? The British science writer Matt Ridley draws a pointed distinction between "science as a philosophy" and "science as an institution." The former grows out of the Enlightenment, which Mr. Ridley defines as "the primacy of rational and objective reasoning." The latter, like all human institutions, is erratic, prone to falling well short of its stated principles. Mr. Ridley says the Covid pandemic has "thrown into sharp relief the disconnect between science as a philosophy and science as an institution."
Mr. Ridley, 63, describes himself as a "science critic, which is a profession that doesn't really exist." He likens his vocation to that of an art critic and dismisses most other science writers as "cheerleaders." That somewhat lofty attitude seems fitting for a hereditary English peer. As the fifth Viscount Ridley, he's a member of Britain's House of Lords, and he Zooms with me from his ancestral seat in Northumberland, just south of Scotland, in between sessions of Parliament (which he also attends by Zoom).
At Oxford nearly 40 years ago, Mr. Ridley studied the mating patterns of pheasants. His fieldwork involved much crouching in long country grass to figure out why these "jolly interesting" birds are polygamous -- unlike most other avians. With the Canadian molecular biologist Alina Chan, he's finishing a book called "Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19," to be published in November.
It will likely make its authors unwelcome in China. As Mr. Ridley worked on the book, he says, it became "horribly clear" that Chinese scientists are "not free to explain and reveal everything they've been doing with bat viruses." That information has to be "dug out" by outsiders like him and Ms. Chan. The Chinese authorities, he says, ordered all scientists to send their results relevant to the virus for approval by the government before other scientists or international agencies could vet them: "That is shocking in the aftermath of a lethal pandemic that has killed millions and devastated the world."
Mr. Ridley notes that the question of Covid's origin has "mostly been tackled by people outside the mainstream scientific establishment." People inside not only have been "disappointingly incurious" but have tried to shut down the inquiry "to protect the reputation of science as an institution." The most obvious reason for this resistance: If Covid leaked from a lab, and especially if it developed there, "science finds itself in the dock."
Other factors have been at play as well. Scientists are as sensitive as other elites to charges of racism, which the Communist Party used to evade questions about specifically Chinese practices "such as the trade in wildlife for food or lab experiments on bat coronaviruses in the city of Wuhan."
Scientists are a global guild, and the Western scientific community has "come to have a close relationship with, and even a reliance on, China." Scientific journals derive considerable "income and input" from China, and Western universities rely on Chinese students and researchers for tuition revenue and manpower. All that, Mr. Ridley says, "may have to change in the wake of the pandemic."
In the U.K., he has also noted "a tendency to admire authoritarian China among scientists that surprised some people." It didn't surprise Mr. Ridley. "I've noticed for years," he says, "that scientists take a somewhat top-down view of the political world, which is odd if you think about how beautifully bottom-up the evolutionary view of the natural world is."
He asks: "If you think biological complexity can come about through unplanned emergence and not need an intelligent designer, then why would you think human society needs an 'intelligent government'?" Science as an institution has "a naive belief that if only scientists were in charge, they would run the world well." Perhaps that's what politicians mean when they declare that they "believe in science." As we've seen during the pandemic, science can be a source of power.
But there's a "tension between scientists wanting to present a unified and authoritative voice," on the one hand, and science-as-philosophy, which is obligated to "remain open-minded and be prepared to change its mind." Mr. Ridley fears "that the pandemic has, for the first time, seriously politicized epidemiology." It's partly "the fault of outside commentators" who hustle scientists in political directions. "I think it's also the fault of epidemiologists themselves, deliberately publishing things that fit with their political prejudices or ignoring things that don't."
Epidemiologists are divided between those who want more lockdowns and those who think that approach wasn't effective and might have been counterproductive. Mr. Ridley sides with the latter camp, and he's dismissive of the alarmist modeling that led to lockdowns in the first place. "The modeling of where the pandemic might go," he says, "presents itself as an entirely apolitical project. But there have been too many cases of epidemiologists presenting models based on rather extreme assumption."
One motivation: Pessimism sells. "You don't get blamed for being too pessimistic, but you do get attention. It's like climate science. Modeled forecasts of a future that is scary is much more likely to get you on television." Mr. Ridley invokes Michael Crichton, the late science-fiction novelist, who hated the tendency to describe the outcomes of models in words that imply they are the "results" of an experiment. That frames speculation as if it were proof.
Climate science is already far down the road to politicization. "Twenty or 30 years ago," Mr. Ridley says, "you could study how the ice ages happened and discuss competing theories without being at all political about it." Now it's very hard to have a conversation on the subject "without people trying to interpret it through a political lens."
Mr. Ridley describes himself as "lukewarm" on climate change. He accepts that humans have made the climate warmer, but doesn't subscribe to any of the catastrophist views that call for radical changes in human behavior and consumption. His nuanced position hasn't protected him from attack, of course, and the British left is prone to vilify him as a "denier."
Climate science has also been "infected by cultural relativism and postmodernism," Mr. Ridley says. He cites a paper that was critical of glaciology -- the study of glaciers -- "because it wasn't sufficiently feminist." I wonder if he's kidding, but Google confirms he isn't. In 2016 Progress in Human Geography published "Glaciers, gender, and science: A feminist glaciology framework for global environmental change research."
The politicization of science leads to a loss of confidence in science as an institution. The distrust may be justified but leaves a vacuum, often filled by a "much more superstitious approach to knowledge." To such superstition Mr. Ridley attributes public resistance to technologies such as genetically modified food, nuclear power -- and vaccines.
If you spurn Covid-19 vaccination, Mr. Ridley says he would "fervently argue" that it is "the lesser of two risks, at least for adults." We have "ample data to show that -- for this vaccine, and for others, going back centuries." He calls vaccination "probably the most massive and incredible benefit of scientific knowledge." Yet it's "counterintuitive and difficult to understand," which may explain why its advocates have been vilified through the centuries.
He cites the example of Mary Wortley Montagu, a British aristocrat, who pushed for smallpox inoculation in Britain after witnessing its administration in Ottoman Turkey in the early 18th century. She was viciously pilloried, he says, as was Zabdiel Boylston, a celebrated Boston doctor who inoculated residents against smallpox during a smallpox outbreak in 1721.
Vaccines have been central to the question of "misinformation" and the White House's pressure campaign against social media to censor it. Mr. Ridley worries about the opposite problem: that social media "is complicit in enforcing conformity." It does this "through 'fact checking,' mob pile-ons, and direct censorship, now explicitly at the behest of the Biden administration." He points out that Facebook and Wikipedia long banned any mention of the possibility that the virus leaked from a Wuhan laboratory.
"Conformity," Mr. Ridley says, "is the enemy of scientific progress, which depends on disagreement and challenge. Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts, as [the physicist Richard] Feynman put it." Mr. Ridley reserves his bluntest criticism for "science as a profession," which he says has become "rather off-puttingly arrogant and political, permeated by motivated reasoning and confirmation bias." Increasing numbers of scientists "seem to fall prey to groupthink, and the process of peer-reviewing and publishing allows dogmatic gate-keeping to get in the way of new ideas and open-minded challenge."
The World Health Organization is a particular offender: "We had a dozen Western scientists go to China in February and team up with a dozen Chinese scientists under the auspices of the WHO." At a subsequent press conference they pronounced the lab-leak theory "extremely unlikely." The organization also ignored Taiwanese cries for help with Covid-19 in January 2020. "The Taiwanese said, 'We're picking up signs that this is a human-to-human transmission that threatens a major epidemic. Please, will you investigate?' And the WHO basically said, 'You're from Taiwan. We're not allowed to talk to you.'"
He notes that WHO's primary task is forestalling pandemics. Yet in 2015 it "put out a statement saying that the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century is climate change. Now that, to me, suggests an organization not focused on the day job."
In Mr. Ridley's view, the scientific establishment has always had a tendency "to turn into a church, enforcing obedience to the latest dogma and expelling heretics and blasphemers." This tendency was previously kept in check by the fragmented nature of the scientific enterprise: Prof. A at one university built his career by saying that Prof. B's ideas somewhere else were wrong. In the age of social media, however, "the space for heterodoxy is evaporating." So those who believe in science as philosophy are increasingly estranged from science as an institution. It's sure to be a costly divorce.

Banking & Finance: Insurers Hit by Smaller Perils --- Climate change and urban sprawl are leading to more localized events

Full text: Floods in Germany, ice storms in Texas and heat domes in the Pacific Northwest are focusing attention in the insurance industry on the cumulative damage wrought by clusters of second-tier catastrophes.
Less devastating than mega events such as earthquakes and hurricanes, these secondary perils, as they are known in the industry, happen relatively frequently and include hail, drought, wildfire, snow, flash floods and landslides.
Climate change and urban sprawl are driving a jump in secondary perils losses, said Tamara Soyka of Swiss Re AG. Insurers and reinsurers, who traditionally focused on predicting big weather events that can cause widespread damage, are increasingly incorporating secondary-peril models.
Swiss Re, for instance, last year started considering pluvial -- that is, heavy rainfall, similar to the recent European floods -- flood zones when assessing risks.
A storm system over Europe dumped heavy rains in recent weeks, causing heavy floods in Germany, Belgium and parts of the Netherlands and Switzerland. The German Insurance Association expects insured losses could hit nearly $6 billion as a result of the flooding in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. It doesn't yet have estimates for the damage in Saxony and Bavaria.
This year is expected to be the most damaging for the country since 2002, when insured storm damage totaled about 11 billion euros, equivalent to $12.98 billion, the association said. While mostly all residential buildings have windstorm and hail coverage, only 46% of homeowners have coverage for heavy rain and floods.
Heavy rain, hailstorms and wind in Germany and Switzerland in June have already cost the industry an estimated $4.5 billion, according to analysts at Berenberg.
Analysts at Moody's Investors Service in a note this week said German insurers "may find it challenging to protect homeowners against climate risk without significant price increases."
Insurers paid out $81 billion for damages related to natural catastrophes in 2020, according to reinsurer Swiss Re, up 50% from 2019 and comfortably topping the $74 billion 10-year average for such losses.
Secondary peril events accounted for more than 70% of the $81 billion in natural catastrophe losses last year, according to the data.
Firms expected to take hits to their earnings from the European floods include Swiss Re, Munich Re AG and Zurich Insurance Group, according to analysts. Spokespeople for Swiss Re, Zurich and Munich Re declined to give estimates of the potential impact.
UBS Group AG analysts project $6 billion worth of losses for the industry, split into $2 billion for primary insurers and $4 billion for reinsurers.
The prospect of more intense weather has insurers rapidly updating their risk-assessment models and recalculating the price of insurance. Property insurers faced an estimated $18 billion bill for damage to homes and businesses from the long stretch of frigid weather in Texas and numerous other states, the equivalent of a major hurricane.
In some cases, the increased frequency of extreme weather events can lead insurers to drop coverage altogether.
Some insurers in California chose to not renew insurance policies for homeowners in high-risk areas for wildfires. California wildfires the prior two years had killed dozens of people and racked up more than $24 billion in insured losses.
Analysts say the losses from the European flooding will be manageable for the industry. While they may dent quarterly or yearly earnings, they won't have a seismic effect on their capital. If the coming U.S. hurricane season is a normal one, that will likely crimp earnings further for some.
The costs of reinsurance in Asia and the U.S. went up over the past couple of years owing to hurricanes and wildfires, said Berenberg analyst Michael Huttner. But prices in Europe didn't increase significantly over that period. The floods will likely help catastrophe pricing increase, said Mr. Huttner.
Will Hardcastle, an analyst at UBS, said this year is shaping up to be the fifth consecutive year that natural catastrophe losses will be above reinsurers' budgeted level.
"The last five years would suggest you're not getting appropriate pricing for it," he said. "It's always difficult to determine whether the trend is short term. Now at this point you have to be thinking it's more structural" because of climate change, he said.

Full text: BERLIN -- When German politicians flocked to the scenes of last week's devastating floods that left more than 170 in the country dead, they all agreed on one thing regardless of their partisan persuasions: The record rainfalls and ensuing disaster were the product of climate change.
There is a broad scientific consensus that temperatures are rising and that this is increasing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which can result in heftier downpours. There also is some evidence that the frequency of extreme weather events -- heat waves, droughts, floods and storms -- has been increasing.
However, scientists say it can be hard to identify the cause of specific extreme occurrences. Nonetheless, they say governments need to start preparing for the possibility of them. They say factors including a lack of preparedness and failure to heed warnings about imminent flooding made the rare event far deadlier than it might otherwise have been.
"[The death toll] is an impact of a failure to deal with climate change, not climate change itself," said Liz Stephens, associate professor at the Department of Geography and Environmental Science at Reading University in Britain.
Immediately after the floods, Armin Laschet, the head of Angela Merkel's conservatives and front-runner to succeed her as chancellor, called for reinforcing policies to combat climate change. The leader of the opposition Greens, Annalena Baerbock, traveled to the affected region and linked the floods with climate change, as did other political leaders from the center-right to the center-left.
Ms. Merkel herself, a scientist by training, was more nuanced. She connected the floods to climate change in the context of extreme weather becoming more common, but said one such flood can't be directly attributed to climate change.
By comparison, the debate about whether better disaster preparedness could have saved lives has been more muted, with only some members of small opposition parties raising questions about authorities' responsibilities for the loss of life.
How much climate change is responsible for heftier and more frequent downpours is a matter of debate even among scientists who say man-made factors such as greenhouse-gas emissions are playing a large role in warming the planet.
Parts of Germany -- including those that were hit by last week's disaster -- regularly have been affected by flooding for centuries, most recently in 2016, 2013 and 2002. The worst recorded flood in western Germany was St. Mary Magdalene's flood of 1342, which was so severe that it permanently altered the landscape in some regions.
And there is no clear trend showing such events are becoming more frequent, according to the German Meteorological Service, which is now investigating with the help of international experts whether the latest flood can be linked to climate change. Their report is due to come out in August, and a spokesman for the government agency said it had yet to find a link.
Doug Smith, who heads decadal climate prediction research and development at the Met Office Hadley Centre in the U.K., said it was unclear whether climate change caused more frequent floods and it wasn't possible to link an individual event to the global trend.
If climate change is making extreme weather events more likely, then this should encourage authorities to shore up defenses against such disasters, said Kaveh Madani, a climate researcher with Yale University, not a reason not to do so.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden plans to nominate Graham Steele as assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions, a move that would put a longtime congressional staffer with ties to progressives at the center of efforts to refocus financial rules on issues such as climate change and racial equity.
Mr. Steele, a former Democratic chief counsel on the Senate Banking Committee and aide to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), would oversee the Biden administration's plans to tighten regulations on Wall Street firms. That could include heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrencies; open-end mutual funds and hedge funds and their roles in market turbulence last year; and the financial sector's exposure to climate-change risks.
Mr. Steele is the director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business, which seeks to "promote more accountable capitalism and governance," according to its website. He previously served as a staffer at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and worked at Public Citizen, a progressive watchdog group, before joining Mr. Brown's staff in 2010.
In recent years, he has been a vocal proponent of treating climate change as a systemic risk to the financial system, and called on U.S. regulators to do more to confront the potential dangers, such as more frequent wildfires or droughts that threaten banks' physical assets.
In a February 2020 paper, he argued the 2010 Dodd-Frank law gave regulators broad power to use macroprudential regulation to address climate-related risks, including through the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Federal Reserve. For example, the Fed could use its authority to limit fossil-fuel investments based on their prospective risks to financial stability, he said.
"By ignoring their responsibility to safeguard financial stability, regulators are allowing financial institutions to continue directing massive amounts of capital into climate-change drivers like fossil fuel and deforestation businesses, further driving a carbon bubble," he said. "This exacerbates climate financial risk, and with it the fragility of the financial system."
In a separate paper last July, Mr. Steele called for changes to bank capital requirements that reflect the climate risks of certain assets, and said policy makers should encourage investments by banks that help make communities more resilient to climate change.
He criticized the Fed's decision last year to buy bonds issued by oil and gas companies as part of its broader efforts to stabilize financial markets at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. And he called on the central bank to directly finance clean energy through so-called green bond purchases.
Mr. Steele has also warned about the risks from the outsize growth of the mutual-fund industry, and outlined ways that policy makers could rein in asset managers, including through new limits on their size and concentration, as well as limits on the stakes they may accumulate in other industries.
If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Steele would join a team of economic advisers in the Biden administration that have strong relationships with progressive lawmakers, including Bharat Ramamurti, a former economic adviser to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) who is the deputy director of the National Economic Council.

Full text: BERLIN -- Last week's devastating floods in Germany that have so far claimed nearly 160 lives have become the central issue of the country's coming election that could reshape its political landscape.
The leading contenders -- as well as Chancellor Angela Merkel, who isn't running for re-election -- have flocked to the worst-hit areas, promising relief and pointing the finger at climate change for one of the country's deadliest disasters since World War II.
International meteorologists warned last weekend that large rainfalls could cause severe flooding in the affected regions. The warning was relayed by the German government's weather service and the media. Yet in Germany's federal system, local authorities are in charge of disaster management, and they didn't order large-scale evacuations.
All the necessary warnings were issued by meteorologists, yet the alert didn't trigger any reaction on the ground, Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading in Britain, told German public broadcaster ZDF. "It's unbelievably frustrating."
After wreaking havoc on western Germany last week, heavy rainfalls moved to southern and eastern parts of the country and into neighboring Austria on Sunday, swelling rivers and overwhelming several towns and villages.
Visiting one of the worst-hit communities on Sunday, Ms. Merkel painted the flood as a warning that authorities should continue their fight against climate change.
"It will be necessary to enact policies that take the environment into account more than has been the case in recent years," she said. Such floods have always taken place, she added, but they are now becoming ever more frequent.
Annalena Baerbock, the Green Party co-chair and lead candidate for the election, interrupted her vacation to travel to flooded areas in Rhineland-Palatinate on Friday, delivering a similar message.
"It is important to me to be personally informed -- without going into areas where acute rescue efforts are ongoing -- about the situation there," Ms. Baerbock told the SWR public-sector broadcaster. She added that much more should be done to fight climate change in coming years.
Scientists say global warming may have played a role in increasing the frequency of severe weather events. But they also say individual disasters such as the latest flooding have often been caused by an array of factors ranging from rare weather patterns to topography and urbanization.
Karl-Rudolf Korte, a professor of political science at the Duisburg-Essen University, said the framing of the event in the context of climate change could benefit the Green Party at the election because surveys showed they enjoyed higher credibility in environmental matters than all other parties.
So could suggestions leveled by some scientists that regional and federal authorities failed to react adequately to the flood warnings, an argument that is so far absent from the political debate here.
The Sept. 26 election is one of the most closely watched in Europe in recent years. It will decide who succeeds Ms. Merkel, one of Europe's most influential and longest-serving leaders, who is bowing out after 16 years in power.
It also is shaping up to be one of the closest in Germany's post-World War II history. Ms. Merkel's conservatives are now polling at 29%, the Greens at 19%, and the Social Democrats at 16%, according to Politico's poll of polls from July 16.
Most pollsters currently predict that the next coalition will be between the conservatives and the Greens, although other, more complicated combinations could emerge given the historically small difference in the parties' respective ratings.
The flooding has now made these calculations even harder to compute.
The need to fight climate change is part of the political consensus in Germany and while some parties have converted more recently to the issue than the Greens, all are advocating similar policies.
Manfred Gullner, head of the Forsa polling group, said there was no evidence that voters linked the flood to climate change. And as an opposition party, the Greens are finding it difficult to slip into a crisis-management role following the disaster, he said.
This is the role Armin Laschet, chairman of Ms. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and front-runner in the race for the chancellery, and Olaf Scholz, federal finance minister and lead candidate for the center-left Social Democrats, have sought to play.
Mr. Laschet's party has wholeheartedly embraced the fight against man-made global warming but he himself has championed a nuanced approach, stressing the need to protect the environment without hurting German industry.
When asked last week whether he would change his stance, he said: "Just because we have a day like this, we should not change our politics."

Bipartisan Bill Drops IRS Funding

Full text: Lawmakers dropped plans to pay for a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package in part by boosting tax-collecting enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service, a setback for the bipartisan measure ahead of a looming deadline for agreement.
The shift came after pushback from Republicans who were wary of granting the agency more money and power, Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), one of the lead negotiators, said Sunday on CNN. Legislative aides from both parties confirmed the move.
The change means that the plan to strengthen the IRS to do more to collect taxes owed but not collected -- a priority for President Biden -- has stalled, at least for now. But lawmakers said it could be revived elsewhere, in a separate spending package pushed by Democrats.
The decision to exclude the IRS provision means lawmakers would have to scramble to replace it to complete the infrastructure package before a midweek deadline, and it casts new uncertainty over the talks.
Republicans and Democrats have spent weeks trying to negotiate an infrastructure deal, including funding for roads, bridges and broadband. But they have struggled with how to cover the cost without increasing the federal deficit, which has risen to record levels over the past few years because of tax cuts and pandemic-related spending. They have said the plan would be fully paid for with new revenue.
Lawmakers face the first test this week of whether there will be enough support to move forward with the infrastructure deal, along with a separate $3.5 trillion budget resolution supported only by Democrats. That package includes provisions aimed at addressing climate change, expanded access to education and affordable child care and broader Medicare benefits. The two pieces of legislation together make up most of the White House's legislative agenda.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said last week that he would take the first procedural step Monday, setting up a vote Wednesday to begin debate on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Democratic support for the infrastructure legislation, however, depends on the party coalescing by the same day around the $3.5 trillion budget resolution.
Both bills rely on fragile coalitions of lawmakers deciding to compromise. Republicans and Democrats were still working on details over the weekend and said they weren't sure if they would meet the midweek deadline.
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) said on Fox News Sunday that meeting the Wednesday deadline was possible, but only if the negotiators agreed on provisions to pay for the plan.
"We need Senate leadership, Schumer, and the White House to work with us. Right now, I can -- I can frankly tell you that they've not," Mr. Cassidy said.
Mr. Portman, the lead GOP negotiator on the infrastructure deal, said they shouldn't have a Wednesday deadline. "It's more important to get it right," he said.
Lawmakers in the bipartisan negotiating group, including Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) had said last week they were already looking at alternatives to the IRS provision to raise revenue. The process has been made difficult by Republicans' refusal to raise taxes and Democrats' unwillingness to raise user fees on lower and middle-income people.
Mr. Portman said Sunday that the new funding shortfall wouldn't derail the overall package, adding that other potential revenue sources existed for the infrastructure plan. Among other options, lawmakers are considering delaying or repealing a Trump-era proposal to end rebates that drugmakers give to Medicare, a change that would save the government revenue.
The group of 11 Republicans and 11 members of the Democratic caucus reached a deal on a broad framework last month with the White House, but some said they wouldn't vote to begin debate on the bill unless a more detailed agreement had been reached. Late last week, disagreements over the IRS issue tripped up lawmakers hoping to complete how the bill's cost would be offset.
"We want to be able to collect the taxes that are due, but we also don't want to harass individuals -- and in between is a fine line we don't want to cross," said Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.), a member of the bipartisan group.
"I don't remember any of these efforts I've ever been involved in that are actually a straight line and get done quickly," Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), a member of the bipartisan infrastructure group, said Thursday.
The infrastructure bill will need 60 votes to advance in the 50-50 Senate, where liberal Democrats have said their support is contingent on the separate antipoverty and climate package securing unanimous support within their party. Democrats plan to advance the $3.5 trillion package through a process tied to the budget that allows it to skirt the 60-vote requirement and pass with a simple majority, provided that they stave off any defections within their own ranks.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, had initially pressed for a $6 trillion package, and some centrists including Sens. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) had hoped for a bill no larger than $2 trillion. Under a framework reached by the Democrats on the Budget Committee last week, including Mr. Sanders, the $3.5 trillion package would combine expanded access to preschool and affordable child care, broader Medicare benefits and programs aimed at addressing poverty and climate change.
Mr. Manchin and some other centrist Democrats said last week that they needed to review more details before committing to support the agreement. Mr. Tester said late last week that he would support at least moving forward with the process of crafting the budget resolution. Mr. Schumer said Senate Democrats have until Wednesday to decide whether they can coalesce around it.
"We need to address some very important issues in this country and I think there's a real possibility that that $3.5 trillion can address some of those issues that aren't addressed in this bipartisan infrastructure package," Mr. Tester said. "So I want to have a debate on it."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has said she won't bring up the bipartisan infrastructure bill until the broader budget package has passed the Senate.
Meanwhile, some centrist House Democrats are urging Mrs. Pelosi to bring up the bipartisan infrastructure bill as soon as it passes the Senate.
"We strongly urge -- and pledge to work with you to bring about -- a House vote on this legislation before the August recess and without any unnecessary or artificial delay upon arrival from the Senate," a group of 10 House Democrats wrote in a letter released Thursday.

Full text: Gas-fired stoves are emerging as a burning issue as American cities consider phasing out natural-gas hookups to homes and businesses to reduce carbon emissions.
Many restaurant and home chefs prefer cooking on gas-burning ranges, and persuading some to switch to electric stovetops is proving to be a hard sell -- a sentiment the natural-gas industry has seized on to rally opposition to new local ordinances.
Several cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have given ground on the issue by exempting stoves from natural-gas bans, or providing pathways for restaurants to secure waivers in an attempt to minimize blowback.
The pushback on stoves demonstrates one of the challenges of reducing the emissions linked to climate change: Consumers may have to make personal sacrifices by giving up things they use and enjoy in favor of less familiar technologies.
George Chen, executive chef and founder of San Francisco restaurant China Live, said he was concerned about cities' restricting a cooking technique that contributes to the texture and flavor of good Chinese cuisine that he said can't be achieved on an electric stove.
"I have respect for the environment, and I drive an electric car and am happy to pay the extra costs because the technology is good," Mr. Chen said. "But to say that an electric stove is as good as a gas one is misunderstanding the art of cooking."
Proponents of electrification say today's induction stoves, which use electromagnetic current to directly heat cookware, are much better than the electric cooktops of yesteryear and -- once cooks learn to use them -- superior to gas. But some restaurant industry groups and others have pushed back against efforts to force them to make the switch.
When Berkeley, Calif., became the first U.S. city to ban natural-gas connections to new homes and businesses two years ago, the California Restaurant Association sued. It argued that the restriction would harm establishments that use the fossil fuel to flame-sear meat, char vegetables and wok-toss rice and noodles. A federal judge dismissed the challenge this month; the restaurant group said it plans to appeal.
Since then, several dozen other U.S. municipalities, including Denver and New York, have either passed or proposed measures that ban or restrict natural gas in new or substantially renovated buildings with the hopes it will help achieve goals of reducing the carbon emissions linked to climate change. In turn, a number of states, including Texas and Georgia, have moved to prohibit local jurisdictions from enacting such bans before more cities can catch on.
The local measures would require the installation of heat pumps and electric appliances instead of gas-powered furnaces, water heaters, ovens and stoves, which are the norm in most of the country. Nationwide, fossil fuels burned for energy in businesses and homes sit at 13% of annual carbon emissions, according to 2019 data from the EPA.
Less than 3% of natural-gas use in homes comes from cooking on gas stoves, according to a residential energy survey from the U.S. Energy Information Administration in 2015.
City carve-outs for gas cooking aren't unreasonable, said Sara Baldwin, who works on electrifying the building sector at environmental policy firm Energy Innovation. But eventually, she believes buildings will need to be fully electrified to meet ambitious emissions-reduction goals.
"The gas industry really wants to make the household stovetop a wedge issue and use that to animate people against electrification as a whole," said Charlie Spatz, a researcher at the Climate Investigations Center, an environmental advocacy group.
Natural-gas utilities and lobbying groups like the American Gas Association have poured money into public-relations campaigns.
"Americans love cooking with gas, so it is understandable that misguided policy makers would try to soften the blow of policies that eliminate affordable, reliable and clean natural gas by exempting natural gas for cooking," said AGA President Karen Harbert in an emailed statement.
While some restaurant industry groups have pushed back against gas bans, Shelby Starks, a personal chef based in Oakland, Calif., said she believes chefs will have to adapt.
"We will see food change on many different fronts, whether it's how we grow the food or how it gets delivered," she said. "Sustainably preparing food is the next frontier."

Full text: The Bank of Japan said it would help finance projects addressing climate change, adding to the debate over whether environmental issues should be part of a central bank's mission.
The Japanese central bank's plans released Friday include no-interest loans to commercial banks to support their lending for projects judged to be environmentally friendly and the purchase of green bonds in foreign currencies.
"We can reduce the concerns and the risk of economic instability caused by climate change by making it easier for companies to make such investments," said Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda.
The decision followed a July 8 action plan released by the European Central Bank in which the ECB said it would incorporate climate change broadly into its decision making and ensure that the companies whose bonds it buys are in tune with Europe's climate targets.
The European and Japanese approaches contrast with the Federal Reserve, whose chairman, Jerome Powell, said in June, "We do not seek to be climate policy makers." Mr. Powell said some climate risks could be relevant to the Fed's existing work of supervising banks and ensuring financial stability, but he said elected officials should drive policy.
The BOJ's Mr. Kuroda said addressing the impact of climate change complied with the bank's mandate of achieving healthy growth with price stability, although he said regulations and direct subsidies to companies were the government's job.
The BOJ said several types of financing by commercial banks would be eligible for central bank support. These include green loans, green bonds, sustainability-linked loans and bonds with performance targets related to efforts on climate change.
Banks that make loans using the new facility will be awarded larger exemptions from the negative interest rate currently charged on some of their deposits at the central bank.

Full text: BERLIN -- Rescuers in Germany and neighboring countries were racing to find survivors from the region's worst flooding in decades, as the death toll rose to more than 120 and hundreds remained missing following days of torrential rainfall.
German authorities used helicopters and drones to locate survivors who fled to roofs and high ground when their homes were engulfed by flash floods that turned streets into rivers, swept away cars and crushed houses.
As waters subsided, more bodies were recovered from flooded houses or from under the rubble of buildings, meaning that the final death toll is likely to be greater, several German officials said.
The German military supported thousands of rescue workers amid a shortage of helicopters and other hardware. Hundreds of houses have collapsed or have been severely damaged in the western states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia.
The town of Erftstadt near Cologne was evacuated after a landslide spreading from a nearby quarry created a huge crater that quickly reached the edge of the settlement. Towns and villages beneath the Steinbach dam were evacuated for fear that the water pressure could collapse the barrier.
Electricity and water supplies, as well as telecommunications were cut off in many affected areas, and parts of key roads and railways were razed by the volumes of floodwater.
More than 100 people had been killed in Germany alone, according to authorities Friday.
"If we look down the decades, there have always been storms and floods," Chancellor Angela Merkel said. "But the frequency is simply worrying and it requires us to act."
Officials said the German government and parliament would work on a substantial financial package to alleviate the suffering of flooded regions.
On Friday, thousands of survivors were being put up in schools, hotels and sports halls, and warned not to return to their homes even if the waters subside because of the risk that foundations could crumble, Rhineland-Palatinate's premier, Malu Dreyer, told a broadcast interview.
In southern Belgium, at least 20 people died, and many were being evacuated in the worst-hit areas in the Wallonia region, authorities said. In the Dutch province of Limburg, rescuers were evacuating areas.
In Germany, the casualties included two firefighters who died Thursday while rescuing people, according to authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia. The rainfall in the region has since subsided but infrastructure has been severely affected. Survivors told German television how the torrent took away all of their possessions. Parts of the Rhine, a major European waterway that swelled over its banks, remained closed.
Germany and its neighbors regularly have been hit by severe floods in the past, most recently in 2013, but the current flooding claimed many more lives than previously. Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia and candidate to succeed Ms. Merkel as chancellor, said the disaster is of historic proportions.
There was no doubt that the flooding had been related to climate change, said German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who called for more political action to lower emissions in the future. But scientists said events such as this week's flooding have more complex causes that make it hard to blame on global warming alone.
Cyclones aren't unusual in this part of Europe, but they normally move eastward gradually. This week's storm, dubbed Bernd by German scientists, hung over the flooded areas for days because it was encased between two areas of high pressure in a configuration known as a blocking pattern, meteorologists said.

Full text: The European Union and China presented sweeping plans to limit greenhouse-gas emissions that will increase costs for industry and consumers, but they drew criticism from environmentalists as not going far enough to slow climate change.
The moves, while both long discussed and still months or years from full implementation, show a new urgency to regulate emissions in two of the world's biggest economies. They come as the Biden administration promises its own bold initiatives but faces big obstacles in Congress.
In the U.S., Senate Democrats are proposing polluter import fees, without providing details, as part of their $3.5 trillion climate, antipoverty and education framework backed by President Biden.
Beijing and the EU are acting ahead of the world's next climate-change conference, scheduled for November in Glasgow, Scotland, where the world's biggest powers hope to hammer out new initiatives to limit emissions.
The EU proposed on Wednesday a broad economic overhaul that would sharply cut the bloc's reliance on fossil fuels and place first-of-its-kind levies on imports from high-emitting countries.
The import-tax plan, which has been in the works for months, has already drawn condemnation from the bloc's trading partners in the developing world and given an additional push to companies to scrutinize emissions throughout global supply chains.
The package of legislation, drafted by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, ranks among the most ambitious plans yet by a major economic power to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane that the vast majority of scientists say are causing the Earth to warm. It calls for a massive shift by companies and households to cleaner technologies such as wind turbines, solar power and electric vehicles -- including a requirement for the share of renewable sources in Europe's energy mix to rise to 40% in 2030 from 20% currently. The plan aims to limit pollution across the European economy, including electricity generation, automobiles, housing, shipping and agriculture.
"Our current fossil-fuel economy has reached its limit," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. "We know that we have to move to a new model."
China plans this week to launch an emissions-trading system focused only on its own companies, establishing the world's largest carbon market and doubling the share of global emissions covered under such programs. Emissions-trading systems put a price on the greenhouse gases generated by industry, increasing the cost of products with the intent of promoting efficiency and cutting emissions.
China's plan will help it achieve its goal of reaching peak emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality, or net zero emissions, by 2060, officials said Wednesday. China is the world's largest carbon emitter.
The trading program will initially involve 2,225 companies in the power sector. Those companies are responsible for a seventh of global carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, according to calculations by the International Energy Agency.
China's officials have signaled that they plan to add the cement, aluminum and steel sectors to the trading system next year. Over the next three to five years, the market is set to expand to seven more high-emissions industries in China: petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, iron and steel, nonferrous metals, paper and domestic aviation.
Emissions trading is one part of the EU's broader plan. Its outlines enjoy strong support in EU capitals, but the details will be fiercely debated in the coming months by national governments and the European Parliament, which must approve the plan before it can become law. Negotiators will work to bridge differences across the EU, from wealthier countries like France -- which has relatively low emissions because of its reliance on nuclear power -- to poorer Eastern European nations such as Poland, a major user of coal-fired electricity.
Policy makers are also wary of sapping public support for the fight against emissions by saddling households with a big increase in their energy bills. In France, a plan to raise a tax on the carbon content of fuel gave birth to the antiestablishment yellow-vest protest movement.
The commission's plan, dubbed the European Green Deal, aims to achieve the bloc's most recent commitment under the Paris Climate Agreement, the 2015 accord that calls for countries to limit global warming to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The EU has passed a law requiring it to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 55% by 2030 compared with 1990, and achieve zero net greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.
European environmental groups said that while the ambition of the EU plans is unprecedented, it still won't be enough to meet the global-warming targets of the Paris climate accord and avert some of the dire consequences of climate change such as drought and rising sea levels. The groups say the EU should aim to cut emissions 65% by 2030.
"This is a major crisis, so 55% for us is just not enough," said Patrick ten Brink, deputy secretary-general of the European Environment Bureau, an umbrella group of activists.
Mr. Biden set targets in April for increasing renewable energy in the U.S., including 100% carbon-free electricity generation by 2035. But a national renewable-energy standard sought by his administration was dropped from an infrastructure bill during negotiations with Republicans, raising questions about how some of the targets will be achieved.
The push for emissions reductions comes as scientists have said the effects of climate change are becoming more evident and disruptive.
The EU's proposals aim to sharply accelerate the bloc's timetable for cutting carbon emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities. Pollution would by 2030 have to fall 61% from 2005 levels, more ambitious than the bloc's current target of a 43% cut. The proposed measures also aim to raise the price of allowances in the EU's emissions market to at least 60 euros a metric ton of carbon dioxide, equivalent to $71.
Traders have bid up the price of EU allowances this year to more than 50 euros a metric ton in anticipation of the tighter limits.
The EU plan would impose a border tax on imports, an idea that has sent shudders through global supply chains and drawn condemnation from developing countries.
The tax, called a carbon border-adjustment mechanism, would establish a new agency to monitor the carbon content of imported goods. Companies importing covered products would need to register with the EU agency and hire companies to audit the emissions of their suppliers.
European companies in industries including cars, metals, aviation and energy largely applauded the EU announcement but said it must be applied fairly across industries and between domestic and foreign producers. EU rules have already forced many companies to cut emissions and they don't want to face a greater disadvantage internationally on cost.

Full text: The last time Democrats controlled the federal government, the party put forward a wide-ranging plan to put a price on carbon emissions, pushing to require companies to buy permits to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases under a so-called "cap-and-trade" program.
But the effort failed, with the bill foundering in the Senate after passing the House.
More than a decade later, Democrats are again hoping to use their control of the House, Senate, and White House to pass a major climate bill. With narrower control of the House and Senate, more private-sector investment in clean energy, and a greater sense of urgency on climate change than in 2009, Democrats are taking a different tack in 2021.
Instead of an economywide cap on carbon emissions, many Democrats are emphasizing new investments in and incentives for clean energy, measures they hope to pass through a budget process called reconciliation.
Democrats are "going to have to rely very heavily on spending and tax areas for a lot of what we need to do this year, it's hard to imagine a regulatory program being enacted in this Congress," said former Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.).
As part of a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure agreement, lawmakers and the White House have proposed spending $7.5 billion on electric-vehicle infrastructure, $73 billion in overhauling the electrical grid, and nearly $50 billion in making infrastructure resilient to climate change. But some Democrats have called those measures insufficient, saying they will vote against the infrastructure proposal if it isn't accompanied by a broader package that includes additional climate-change provisions.
Republicans have lined up in opposition to that broader package, which could also include spending on education, healthcare, and antipoverty programs. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has dismissed Democrats' plans as "radical climate demands."
With no expected GOP support for the bill, any single Democrat in the Senate and any group of five Democrats in the House could block the legislation.
While the reconciliation package is still under construction, Democratic aides and lawmakers expect that it will include hundreds of billions worth of tax incentives for purchasing electric vehicles, conserving energy in buildings and producing clean electricity.
The White House and Democrats are also seeking to implement a clean-electricity standard, a requirement that utilities derive energy from carbon-free sources.

Full text: As the temperature in Portland, Ore., soared past 100 degrees last week, Penny Clark's body temperature rose as well. After sitting inside all day without air conditioning, the 79-year-old was running a fever of 102, and the friend she was staying with called 911.
Mrs. Clark, whose daughter said she had a weak heart, died of hyperthermia in an ambulance on the way to the hospital.
"It just didn't have to happen," said Shelley Robertson, her daughter.
At least 118 people died in the record heat wave that engulfed the Pacific Northwest in late June, when Portland and Seattle hit record highs of 116 degrees and 108, respectively. Lytton, a village in British Columbia, reached 121 degrees. A wildfire destroyed most of its homes, and at least two people died.
Local governments opened cooling centers and asked apartment managers to check on residents who might be at risk. Still, the heat strained the healthcare system in a part of the country unaccustomed to extreme temperatures.
So far, 15 heat-related deaths have been reported in King County, home to Seattle, in addition to 103 across Oregon.
Jennifer Vines, health officer for Portland's Multnomah County, said most of the 64 people known to have died there fit the same profile as Mrs. Clark: older, with pre-existing conditions and no air conditioning. Many were also socially isolated.
Emergency rooms were overflowing by the third straight day of temperatures above 100 degrees in Multnomah County last week. Calls to 911 surged to twice their usual level, according to county and hospital officials.
At Legacy Health, a hospital system with six locations in the Portland area, some emergency rooms had up to 10 people waiting for beds, said Melinda Muller, interim chief medical officer. With other area hospitals full and ambulances backed up, hospitals struggled to transfer patients, a normal practice when a facility is near capacity.
"The ambulance service was busy taking care of other people, so there were some delays there," Dr. Muller said. "It took longer to get people where they needed to go."
Early last week, emergency-response times averaged 15 minutes, according to Multnomah County officials, more than double the usual time. A spokeswoman for the county's ambulance service, American Medical Response, didn't respond to a request for comment on the longer response times.
Extreme heat has killed at least 166,000 people world-wide over the past two decades, according to the World Health Organization. In the U.S., more than 1,000 people died during a 1995 heat wave in the Midwest, including 465 in Chicago. A 2003 heat wave killed more than 70,000 people across Europe.
Research shows that extreme-heat events are becoming more common as climate change pushes up global temperatures. A study published last month in Nature Climate Change examining data from 1991 to 2018 found 37% of warm-season heat-wave deaths can be attributed to climate change.
The Pacific Northwest is accustomed to temperate summers. In Portland, the average high temperature for June 28, the day the heat peaked last week, is 77 degrees. About 79% of homes in the Portland area and 44% of those in the Seattle area have some form of air conditioning, according to the Census Bureau.
In Oregon, officials are seeking ways to better withstand heat waves in the future. A spokesman for Oregon Occupational Safety and Health said the agency was considering emergency rules for farms related to water and shade after one farmworker, a Guatemalan immigrant, died during the heat wave.

Full text: [Bezos Hands Over the Keys: On July 5, Andy Jassy becomes only the second chief executive in Amazon's history. He'll take over a wildly successful e-commerce colossus with 1.3 million employees and an unshakable hold on American consumers. Antitrust questions loom. Oh, and the old boss isn't exactly going away quietly.]
When Jeff Bezos steps down as CEO Monday, it will be 27 years to the day he started Amazon.com Inc. He's not wasting much time on his second act, or his third.
Mr. Bezos, who will become executive chairman, plans to launch into space two weeks later in a capsule built by his rocket company, Blue Origin, in what is to be the program's first human space flight.
The trip will be the most public showcase of Mr. Bezos' pursuits outside of Amazon as he hands off day-to-day management of the e-commerce titan to his successor, Amazon Web Services Chief Executive Andy Jassy. Mr. Bezos, the world's richest person, has been gradually moving to an expansive post-CEO life that aside from space exploration includes a climate-focused philanthropy and an embrace of celebrity, complete with public appearances with actors and moguls, multimillion-dollar homes, globe-trotting on private jets and a soon-to-be-completed superyacht.
The 57-year-old Amazon founder has prepared closely for his departure and is handing the company's top post to one of his most trusted advisers in Mr. Jassy, even as he has signaled to investors that he intends to remain involved. Mr. Bezos has said in his role as chairman he will focus on new initiatives and innovations, including on projects to make Amazon's warehouses safer for workers.
"You don't want an organization to incur a knowledge gap," said Colin Bryar, who served as an early technical adviser to Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos, he said, has noted that executive transitions should be "boring."
Amazon declined to make Mr. Bezos available for an interview.
These days, one of the best ways to know what Mr. Bezos is up to, or his whereabouts, is his Instagram account. One of his latest posts shows him embracing movie star Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson while teasing a partnership between Amazon Studios and Mr. Johnson's Seven Bucks Productions company. Several recent posts have been about a newer interest -- fighting climate change. Mr. Bezos last year announced the creation of the $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund, one of the world's largest climate-focused initiatives. Mr. Bezos is worth roughly $200 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
So far, the Earth Fund program has operated largely outside the public eye.
In November, when it announced its first $791 million in grants, it had not yet established an office, hired an executive director or set up a website. Nonprofits working on climate issues said they were in the dark about what Mr. Bezos wanted to fund, or what his overall strategy was. In March, Mr. Bezos announced that the fund had hired Andrew Steer, head of the economic and environment nonprofit World Resources Institute, as president and chief executive. In an interview, Mr. Steer said the fund's first grants showcased interests in research, data, policy and advocacy.
Grantees say Mr. Bezos' grant-making initially has been marked by speed, low levels of paperwork and his direct involvement. Gloria Walton, president and chief executive of the Oakland, Calif.-based Solutions Project, which landed a grant of $43 million, said Mr. Bezos outlined his inexperience in a call and said he wanted to learn and listen. She said she pressed him to give more grants to community-based groups led by women and people of color, and he was responsive.
"This is the way he does it. There is not a lot of infrastructure. There is not a lot of upfront strategy development, and he is hands-on," said Angela Anderson, director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which received a $15 million grant. The group said it would use the grant to support updates for the U.S. electrical grid and to help speed up the electrification of commercial trucking.
Other recipients included the World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund, which each received a $100 million grant, as well as San Francisco-based ClimateWorks Foundation, which received a $50 million grant.
"He's conveyed the fact that acting on climate change can actually drive more economic efficiency. It can drive new technologies. It can lower risk," Mr. Steer said, adding that while the fund is still in its early stages, it will largely be based in Washington, D.C., and plans to build a "world-class team" at the direction of Mr. Bezos.
Mr. Bezos in recent years has spent more time on high-level decisions at Amazon as he's also transformed into a much more public figure.
He became a tabloid sensation as he began to devote more time to Hollywood parties and events while posting selfies online with celebrities such as the singer Lizzo. Mr. Bezos has been often spotted with his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, at celebrity parties, flashy beach clubs, sports games and on foreign trips, including a visit to India last year where Ms. Sanchez joined Mr. Bezos. While in New Delhi, Mr. Bezos pledged to invest an additional $1 billion in the company's Indian operations. He recently purchased a 417-foot-long yacht under construction that cost more than $500 million, according to Bloomberg.
Mr. Bezos has slowly built up a sprawling portfolio of assets, including Blue Origin, more than $300 million in real-estate investments and his $250 million purchase of the Washington Post in 2013. He has devoted primarily every Wednesday to Blue Origin, using a conference room to take meetings and get updates.
On the flight aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft, the plan is for Mr. Bezos to be joined by his brother, Mark Bezos, who co-founded private-equity firm HighPost Capital. Two other passengers are expected to be a yet-to-be-named winner of a charity auction, and 82-year-old pilot Wally Funk, known from the 1960s "Mercury 13" program that tested female pilots for astronaut fitness but never sent them to space.
Passenger training involves having to scale the launch tower -- about seven stories high -- in under 90 seconds. The capsule is fully autonomous and will carry passengers briefly above the Karman line, considered the beginning of space, before returning to Earth.
Mr. Bezos, who said the flight is "a big deal for me," has been working toward the goal since starting the space company 21 years ago in Kent, Wash. For years, Mr. Bezos has sold $1 billion worth of Amazon shares a year to fund the space program.
In an Instagram post announcing the flight, he described the trip as something he has wanted to accomplish since he was a young child.
"The greatest adventure," he wrote.

Full text: Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Darren Woods apologized and disavowed statements made by two of the company's top Washington lobbyists after an environmental group released a video recording of them dismissing its public positions on climate change.
In a recording with a representative for Greenpeace, which tricked the lobbyists into believing they were conducting video interviews with a recruiter, Keith McCoy, Exxon's senior director of federal relations, called the company's support for a carbon tax to help address climate change an "easy talking point" because it is a policy unlikely to ever be implemented.
"Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans," Mr. McCoy said in a video of the interview that Greenpeace posted online Wednesday. "And the cynical side of me says yeah we kind of know that. But it gives us a talking point. We can say well what is Exxon Mobil for? Well we're for a carbon tax."
Mr. McCoy also said he had been "playing defense" by working to strip out certain provisions aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the massive infrastructure package proposed by President Biden. Exxon was seeking to water down the legislation by lobbying lawmakers in both parties, such as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, he said.
"You stick to highways and bridges then a lot of the negative stuff starts to come out," Mr. McCoy said in the video. "There's a germaneness. . .why would you put in something on emissions reductions on climate change to oil refineries in a highway bill."
In addition, Mr. McCoy appeared to say that Exxon had previously supported groups that attempted to discredit climate-change research, though he didn't provide specifics, and added that Exxon didn't commit any crimes.
"Did we aggressively fight against some of the science?" Mr. McCoy said. "Yes. Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, that's true."
Greenpeace said individuals working for its Unearthed investigative platform had posed as recruitment consultants looking to hire a lobbyist for a client and conducted videointerviews with Mr. McCoy and Dan Easley, Exxon's executive branch and regulatory team lead until February.
Hours after the group posted the video, Mr. Woods issued a statement saying that the views expressed by Messrs. McCoy and Easley don't represent Exxon's position on climate-change issues and that the men were never involved in developing the company's policy positions on the issues discussed.
"We condemn the statements and are deeply apologetic for them, including comments regarding interactions with elected officials," Mr. Woods said. "We were shocked by these interviews and stand by our commitments to working on finding solutions to climate change."
Mr. McCoy and Mr. Easley couldn't be reached for comment.Mr. Easley left Exxon this year to join Apex Clean Energy, a renewable-energy company.
In a post on the website LinkedIn, Mr. McCoy apologized for the comments made in the video.
"I am deeply embarrassed by my comments and that I allowed myself to fall for Greenpeace's deception," the post stated. "My statements clearly do not represent ExxonMobil's positions on important public policy issues."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Democratic Party progressives are pushing President Biden to include in his infrastructure agenda stringent measures to address climate change, including policies designed to end the nation's reliance on natural gas as a fuel source.
The more the progressives succeed, the more moderate Democrats in energy-producing states become vulnerable to losing seats that are crucial to the party's hold on Congress, current and former House members say.
The White House announced a deal last week with centrist lawmakers in the Senate on a roughly $1 trillion package focused on traditional infrastructure such as roads and bridges. On a separate track, Democrats are advancing a second bill -- without Republican input -- that among other goals aims to eliminate greenhouse-gas emissions from electric power generation by 2035.
The Democrats have a similar target of 2050 for other emissions sources, including factories, trucks, automobiles and homes. That is a political headache for moderates such as Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (D., Texas), who in 2018 flipped a Republican-held House seat. Ms. Fletcher's Houston-area House district ranks second in the nation for employment tied to the oil and gas industries, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
"Gas is a part of our energy mix," said Ms. Fletcher. She has overcome Republican attack ads portraying her as a problem for the natural-gas industry with a message that contrasts with that of the rest of her party: "I think it will be a part of our energy mix well into the future."
Energy policy is high on the list of issues creating strife among Democrats, along with other themes such as universal healthcare and police reform. Energy would be at the center of the second, all-Democrat infrastructure bill, which would require support from centrists -- including Sen. Joe Manchin, who hails from West Virginia, a fracking state -- given the Democrats' narrow 220-211 majority in the House and the evenly divided Senate.
Some moderates are distancing themselves from the progressive push to increase regulation of natural gas extraction. In January, four Texas House Democrats wrote to Mr. Biden asking him to abandon an executive order suspending new oil and gas leases on federal public lands and waters.
Along with Ms. Fletcher, the letter was signed by Reps. Vicente Gonzalez, Henry Cuellar, and Marc Veasey, who said Mr. Biden's policy "would have far-reaching negative consequences," including the "near-term loss of potentially one million jobs."
Texas is the nation's top producer of natural gas, according to U.S. government statistics, and gas production is a key economic driver in the country as a whole. A fracking boom in recent decades enabled the U.S. to tap into vast new sources of domestic energy. Gas displaced coal in 2016 as the biggest source of U.S. electricity and helped the U.S. become a net fuel exporter for the first time since the 1950s.
Natural gas not only fuels power grids but is used in factories and homes by businesses and consumers alike. Revenues from natural gas production contribute to federal, state and local government budgets. And gas industry jobs pay about twice as much as the U.S. average.
The oil and gas industries are big employers in several competitive House districts that Democrats won or lost by narrow margins in 2020. They include the Texas districts represented by Ms. Fletcher and Mr. Gonzalez, both of whom won re-election by about 3 percentage points.
Those districts rank among the top 15 of all congressional districts for employment tied either directly or indirectly to the oil and gas industries as of 2019, data from the American Petroleum Institute show. So do two House districts that Democrats picked up in 2018 only to lose in 2020, in New Mexico and Oklahoma.
"Texas voters get pretty anxious when they start thinking that their wages are going to go down," said Rep. Filemon Vela (D., Texas), who isn't running for re-election next year.
"There's no guarantee," Ms. Vela said. "Nobody's told them, 'We've got a new job for you. It's going to pay as much as you're making now.'"
For years, natural gas escaped the scrutiny directed at oil and coal because it released half as much carbon-dioxide as coal when burned for electricity. When investor T. Boone Pickens, a Republican, touted gas, his pitch resonated with Democrats. "I've been converted," said former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) in 2009. "I now belong to the Pickens church."
Scientists later determined that pipeline leaks of methane, a large component of natural gas, wiped out much of its climate advantages, given that methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide in trapping gas in the atmosphere. The Obama administration sought to make gas more climate-friendly through regulation aimed at controlling methane leaks. After the Trump administration reversed those efforts, the Senate and House reinstated the rules in a measure that Biden is soon expected to sign into law.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee has drafted legislation that treats gas as a clean energy so long as its emissions can be used, captured or sequestered. But the industry has struggled to commercialize the technology needed to capture them. Many Democrats now say the goal should be to switch away from natural gas entirely rather than invest new money in gas infrastructure that may propagate emissions for decades.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) is pushing measures to provide incentives to reduce electricity emissions 80% by 2030. That is consistent with Mr. Biden's jobs plan, which calls for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035.
"You're producing carbon dioxide, so you want to do everything you can to have as fast a transition as possible off of natural gas," said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), who says he refuses to back any infrastructure package that lacks robust measures to respond to climate change.

Full text: "Stakeholder capitalism" has a lovely ring to it -- the idea that leaders no longer focus exclusively on shareholder value, but instead run companies for the benefit of all stakeholders: customers, suppliers, employees, investors and communities.
But if you're a corporate leader, it inevitably leads to a difficult question: How do you actually do it?
After all, calls to "balance" stakeholder interests sound nice, but in the end are impractical at best and disingenuous at worst. At some point, a company leader has to choose whom to offend and whom to listen to. Do you pay attention to the employees arguing that your business should no longer accept oil companies as customers? Or to the investors who are pressing you to cut off key suppliers on human-rights grounds? Or to the community leaders who are lobbying you to increase your wages above market levels?
Because while there's a risk to having stakeholders say you're ignoring them, there is a bigger risk saying yes yes yes to people, and then have them accuse you of being hypocritical.
Leaving aside the pros and cons of this new vision of capitalism, let's assume you're a business leader who believes that the world has changed and that it makes sense to pay attention to broader interests and voices. Here is some guidance on how to navigate that difficult and confusing terrain.
Determine relevance
In theory, every potential issue is important. In practice, every potential issue can't be equally important. So the obvious place for any company to start is to figure out which environmental, social and governance issues are relevant to it. While such issues as climate change, executive pay and diversity are material to almost every company, how they relate to a business will vary by industry and company.
If you're running an apparel company, for instance, relevant issues might include working conditions in supply-chain factories, the environmental impact of fast fashion, overuse of water and chemicals, and human-rights risks in cotton farming. A pharmaceutical executive, by contrast, is unlikely to see much relevance -- or face much pressure -- regarding child labor or human trafficking, but will need to focus on costs and access to drugs, product quality and safety, waste management and sales ethics.
This is just a start -- the range of issues that will require monitoring, and that companies will need to answer questions about. But not all these issues will be equally important to your business or stakeholders, so you'll need to figure out where to truly focus.
Gather internal insights
Now look inside your company for perspectives on which of these material issues are most relevant to your business model and strategy. Ask your teams in sales and marketing, strategy, risk and investor relations about the questions they face. Are big customers and investors asking similar questions about plastic waste, board diversity or climate change?
Just as important, ask your employees. Young employees increasingly believe their careers should align with their values, and they possess considerable insights on how best to respond to new social and environmental pressures. This does not mean key decisions should be driven by your loudest, angriest workers. Gather staff insights via anonymous surveys that invite thinking on environmental and social priorities, values and trust in leadership.
By the end of this phase, you should have a good sense of which ESG issues are most relevant to both your bottom line and to your employees.
Prioritize ruthlessly
This is where the exercise gets interesting.
Create a four-quadrant matrix with the internal priorities along the "y" axis and the external priorities along the "x" axis. Place each of your material issues on the matrix. Then see what falls where:
The issues in the bottom left quadrant are your lowest priority, not especially important to your employees or your outside stakeholders. They indicate where you need only meet minimum standards and satisfy ESG disclosure questionnaires.
The issues in the top left quadrant may mark flagship internal initiatives that do not resonate with external observers. They might be topics that require more and better internal communications.
The issues in the bottom right quadrant are important to some external stakeholders but don't represent commercial or strategic priorities for your business. But you also need to keep an eye on these. Maybe they are in that quadrant because there's a lot of outside noise about them, but they aren't all that important for the business. Or maybe they are important issues, such as climate change or human rights, that don't show up on the internal priority list because there's a lack of clear ownership or confusion over what actions to take. But they have the ability to blow up when you aren't ready.
The issues in the top right quadrant tell you where you need to aim high. These are the issues on which you need to establish ongoing dialogue with particularly influential and informed stakeholders. You should be ruthlessly clear about the areas in which you and your company seek to display leadership; you won't be trusted unless you ensure that your actions and rhetoric are aligned across the organization.
Suppose you are a technology manufacturer. Your highest-priority issues in the top right quadrant might include employee development and engagement, responsible sourcing, and data protection and privacy. The issues in your top left quadrant might be health and safety, operations management, waste, water and energy use -- things that you have to work on internally but won't require a major public initiative. In the bottom right quadrant, you might see stakeholder concerns over such issues as human rights, product use and integrity, and the social influence of technology -- all of which may be theoretically important to your business, but where you have less direct influence and less cause to allocate a lot of resources. Low-priority issues might be philanthropy or community development, which aren't areas that negatively affect either your business or your stakeholders.
Or suppose you are a diversified retailer. Your top right quadrant, highest-priority issues might include product quality and safety, labor practices, consumer behavior and responsible marketing. The internal business priorities in your top left quadrant might encompass employee recruitment and retention, resource use and waste management. At the bottom right, stakeholders will be vocal about the social and environmental impact of products and packaging -- issues over which you have less direct control. Issues such as climate change, biodiversity and water might be lower priorities: They pose little direct operational impact, and stakeholders concerned about these issues will focus first on other sectors.
While the idea of running a business in the interests of all stakeholders is too abstract to be useful, the primacy of shareholder value can no longer serve as business's all-powerful, guiding beacon. There are too many examples of expensive reputational crises that could have been prevented by using a broader lens. In gathering stakeholder insights and analyzing them with focus and discipline, leaders can ensure that their business is positioned to navigate any turbulence and thrive over the long term.
This approach to ESG is not a fad or an excuse for corporate paralysis. It's a practical step into the future.

Full text: ESG investing has come a long way in the past few years.
Once a niche investment sector, strategies that screen companies and other assets based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are attracting more money than ever.
There are various definitions of -- and approaches to -- so-called sustainable investing. Some strategies seek to avoid investments in industries deemed harmful to society such as tobacco, while others aim to further environmental or social causes like climate change or workplace diversity. Regardless of the approach, interest in the category as a whole is growing dramatically.
At the end of 2019, about $17.1 trillion -- roughly one-third of all assets under professional management in the U.S. -- was being managed using some type of sustainable-investment strategy or by institutions that filed shareholder resolutions on ESG issues, according to the most recent data from the US SIF Foundation, a sustainable-investing trade group. That was a 42% increase from two years earlier, the group said.
In the first quarter of this year, meanwhile, a net $21.5 billion flowed into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that use ESG screens or some other type of sustainable-investing approach, a record amount and almost double the net inflows in the year-earlier quarter, according to a report from Morningstar Inc.
"Individual investors are connecting with the idea that they can address some of the challenges they are concerned about," says Michael Jantzi, chief executive officer of Sustainalytics, a Morningstar company that focuses on ESG and corporate-governance research.
As more people dip their toes into ESG waters, however, expectations are changing: In addition to feeling good about where they are putting their money, these investors also crave good returns. And while there are more ways to measure how seriously companies and asset managers take sustainability issues such as workplace diversity and carbon emissions, there still is a lack of clarity when it comes to ESG disclosures, an area where regulators have started weighing in.
Here is a closer look at those and other shifts taking place in ESG investing in 2021:
Mainstream success
For years, there has been a subset of investors focused on ESG, and companies that have quietly made such issues a priority, says John Streur, president and CEO of Calvert Research and Management, an investment-management firm that specializes in responsible and sustainable investing across global capital markets. Now, more investors and companies are getting on board, he says, as a growing body of research suggests that focusing on material ESG issues can drive better financial performance. Outside factors also have been at play, including a political focus on climate change and racial and social unrest following the May 2020 killing of George Floyd and a global pandemic that showed how quickly a multitude of lives can be upended.
"Five years ago, people could still say this is some far-off problem and it could impact my great-great-grandchildren, and I'm not going to worry about it in my investments today," Mr. Streur says. "That has been debunked and it's right here, right now."
Higher expectations
The socially conscious investors of yesterday tended to be more focused on causes than performance. These days, a lot more people are in it not just to advance causes they believe in, but in the hopes of achieving returns that are equal to or greater than those of traditional investments.
"The whole movement has shifted," says Craig Jonas, co-founder and CEO of CoPeace, an impact-investing holding company in Denver. "Investors like the idea of having measurable impact plus strong returns," he says.
A notable 47% of respondents in the Schroders 2020 Global Investor Study say they are attracted to sustainable investments because of their environmental impact, while another 42% base their attraction to sustainable funds on the likelihood they will provide higher returns.
Whether values-based investing actually pays off, however, is a matter of debate. Last year, U.S. sustainable equity funds outperformed their traditional peer funds by a median total return of 4.3 percentage points, while U.S. sustainable bond funds outperformed their traditional peer funds by a median total return of 0.9 percentage point, according to a report from the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing.
But Meir Statman, professor of finance at Santa Clara University in California, says socially responsible funds tend to have higher annual fees, so their returns are likely to lag behind over time.
"Short-run realized returns are noisy because of luck or other circumstances, sometimes favoring ESG investors and sometimes favoring non-ESG ones," Dr. Statman says. "Each tends to crow when returns favor them. The logic of fees, however, suggests that, in the long run, ESG investors are likely to earn lower after-fee returns than non-ESG investors."
Dr. Statman advises ESG investors to see how their particular ESG fund stacks up over time against a low-cost index fund of the same category. He offers the example of the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund, categorized by Vanguard as a large growth fund. It had an annualized return between May 31, 2000, and June 17, 2021, of 6.73%, compared with 7.67% for the Vanguard Growth Index Fund, also a large growth fund, over the same period.
A look at costs shows that the average annual expense ratio of sustainable ETFs that invest in U.S. stocks is 0.33% versus 0.09% for U.S. equity ETFs in the cheapest quintile by fee, according to Morningstar Direct, an investment-research platform.
Product proliferation
A few years ago, it was hard to build a well-rounded portfolio solely from ESG investments, says Heidi Vanni, chief client officer and managing director at Boston Trust Walden Co., a Massachusetts chartered bank and trust company. That is no longer the case, she says.
"Today, in both the public and private markets, there's no shortage of products -- ESG opportunities abound," says Ms. Vanni.
Just how fast have ESG investments grown? The number of U.S. open-ended funds and ETFs with defined sustainability objectives at the end of 2020 grew around 30% from the year before, according to Morningstar. That's a nearly fourfold increase over the past decade, with significant growth beginning in 2015. As of the end of the first quarter of 2021, there were 409 of these funds, according to Morningstar.
More transparency
One thing that makes some investors wary of ESG is the lack of transparency around what ESG really means and how to measure it. Part of the problem is that there is no one global standard for ESG reporting.
In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission generally requires public companies to disclose ESG information if they deem it "material" to their financial condition, operating performance or to risks investors may face. That leaves a lot of wiggle room.
Without a common standard for accountability, companies can cherry pick which metrics to make public in their annual sustainability reports and which to keep close to the vest. Some companies have even been accused of greenwashing -- that is, conveying a false impression or providing misleading information about their products being environmentally friendly.
In a 2020 BlackRock investing survey, 53% of global respondents cited the "poor quality or availability of ESG data and analytics" as their biggest barrier to adopting sustainable investing, higher than any other barrier that was tested.
Efforts to improve transparency are under way. The European Union in March introduced rules requiring asset managers to start disclosing information on their funds' environmental and social claims and prepare to back up their claims with more detailed disclosures in January 2022. The EU also has proposed that starting in 2024, nearly 50,000 publicly traded and large private companies will have to report standardized data on various ESG metrics.
In the U.S., the SEC in March announced an enforcement task force to focus on areas including climate and ESG-disclosure at public companies. In April, regulators published examples of what they believe fund managers and investment advisers are doing wrong with respect to ESG disclosures and related areas. And in mid-June, the SEC announced its annual regulatory agenda, which includes disclosures related to climate change and corporate board diversity, among other things.
Data providers, meanwhile, are developing more tools to help investors evaluate how companies stack up. Global index provider MSCI just launched the MSCI Target Scorecard, which allows institutional investors to make direct comparisons between companies' climate commitments and assess which companies have realistic decarbonization targets.
Under the microscope
Investors also are watching closely to make sure executives live up to their ESG promises. This proxy season, in particular, institutional investors ratcheted up the pressure on company executives to take action in areas such as climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion and racial justice.
In particular, shareholders at American Express, Berkshire Hathaway, International Business Machines and Union Pacific showed strong support for resolutions requiring the companies to provide data to support their claims of diversity and inclusion, according to As You Sow, a nonprofit that promotes environmental and social corporate responsibility.
"Companies currently tell us stories about their commitments to diverse employees," says Meredith Benton, workplace-equity program manager at As You Sow. "We're asking companies to show investors if they can, or cannot, provide data that substantiates what they tell us."
With the Biden administration pledging to substantially slash U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases by 2030, U.S. companies in all industries are likely to be under scrutiny when it comes to their climate policies. It's an issue that investors and executives at every company will have to address in some way -- big or small, given the underlying social demand, says Remy Briand, head of ESG at MSCI.
Asset-management firms, too, are being evaluated for their ability to offer ESG and impact investments. In January, more than a dozen institutional plan sponsors and investment consultants formed the Institutional Investing Diversity Cooperative to increase data and transparency within investment teams in the asset-management industry.
In addition to the sustainability ratings it provides for funds, Morningstar also offers a ratings system for asset managers to evaluate how well they incorporate ESG factors into their investment processes.
"It's a practice-what-you-preach moment for the industry," says Amy O'Brien, global head of responsible investing at Nuveen, a global investment manager.

Full text: SYDNEY -- The United Nations body that oversees World Heritage sites has recommended that Australia's Great Barrier Reef be classified as in danger, saying the country's center-right government hasn't done enough to protect the reef from the effects of climate change.
The warning echoes the concerns of environmental groups that say the reef is deteriorating after experiencing three mass coral-bleaching events in roughly the past five years, the frequency of which scientists attribute to climate change. Bleaching, which occurs when water temperatures rise, can kill the corals and one study last year estimated the reef has lost more than half its coral since the 1990s.
The recommendation from Unesco, the U.N. culture and heritage organization, must still be approved by the 21-member World Heritage Committee, which includes Australia and is scheduled to meet in July. If approved, the reef will join a list of 53 other World Heritage sites that are considered to be threatened, and Australia could be asked to work with U.N. experts to develop a plan to better protect the reef.
Environmental groups said placing the reef on the danger list would send a strong message to Australia's government that it must move faster to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions scientists say are a main contributor to climate change.
"The more we raise awareness of the consequences of climate change and call out those who are failing to act, the better," said Nicki Hutley, an economist at the nonprofit Climate Council.
Australian officials said they intend to challenge the Unesco recommendation at next month's meeting. Australian Environment Minister Sussan Ley said she agrees that climate change is the biggest threat to the reef, but that the reef has been unfairly singled out for a danger listing and that many other World Heritage sites are also under a general threat from climate change.
Ms. Ley said Australia has invested 3 billion Australian dollars, equivalent to $2.3 billion, in protecting the reef, including water-quality management efforts and research into heat-resistant corals and restoration. She said Unesco didn't use the latest data in its recommendation and that more recent data show some recovery from the bleaching events.
"The reef is an icon internationally and we are here to fight for the reef," she told reporters, adding that officials are also concerned a danger listing could hurt tourism.
The Great Barrier Reef is the most extensive in the world, stretching for about 1,400 miles along Australia's northeastern coastline. It is home to 400 species of coral, 1,500 species of fish and 240 species of birds, according to Unesco. It was listed as a World Heritage site in 1981, and no other World Heritage site contains such biodiversity, the agency says.
Australia has signed on to the Paris climate accord to limit the rise in global temperatures, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has been criticized by environmental groups for approving new fossil-fuel projects and for not setting a firm target for Australia -- which has relatively high carbon emissions per capita -- to reach net-zero carbon emissions.
Mr. Morrison has said he would prefer to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, slower than some environmental groups say is ideal, and that he would like to reduce emissions through new technology and market forces rather than taxes and regulation.
Despite concerns about the overall health of the reef, some areas are still vibrant. Steve Sherwell, owner of Reef Sprinter, which runs snorkeling tours out of Port Douglas in Queensland state, said the reef is in good condition near him and he worried that the constant headlines about the decline of the reef could put off visitors.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to require public companies to disclose more information about how they respond to threats linked to climate change -- and businesses are gearing up for a fight.
The SEC's new chairman, Biden administration appointee Gary Gensler, has said climate-related disclosure is a top priority. President Biden met Monday with Mr. Gensler, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other top financial regulators to discuss the issue. The SEC has already sought industry input, much of which arrived last week, for a rule proposal that could be issued by October.
Technology companies such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which have long touted their efforts to reduce their impact on the environment, say they support the initiative. Energy and transportation companies have told the SEC that climate disclosures could be misunderstood by investors who lack experience with the data or put too much weight on one factor, like a company's total greenhouse-gas emissions.
The SEC has broad authority to require disclosures by companies selling securities. But how it elicits specific information about climate change, whose impact on every company's bottom line isn't always clear, is likely to become a political lightning rod and set off a burst of lobbying in Washington.
The challenge, regulators and corporate officials say, is identifying which measurements are necessary to help investors gauge a company's financial prospects, and how to set requirements that are flexible enough to generate specific, and not generic, information about corporate risks.
"It's a generational project unlike anything the SEC has ever undertaken," said Robert Jackson Jr., a former SEC commissioner. "It requires a great deal of expertise at the staff level and an enormous amount of market outreach."
About 90% of the firms in the S&P 500 publish voluntary reports disclosing statistics on things like carbon emissions and how much renewable energy they use. The content isn't typically reviewed by regulators. Only 16% report similar metrics in regulatory filings, according to S&P Global Sustainable1, a business of the asset-ratings and market-data provider S&P Global.
"Without a mandatory disclosure requirement, we expect to see a continuation of the current hodgepodge of disclosures in which issuers oftentimes cherry-pick which disclosure to adhere to, or in some cases, simply choose to avoid disclosure altogether," Pacific Investment Management Co. managing director Scott Mather wrote to the SEC.
Biden administration officials say better corporate reporting on climate change will channel more capital toward greener industries, helping governments reach the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 under the Paris Agreement. Globally, about $1.6 trillion a year is needed to meet that goal, according to the Energy Transitions Commission, a group of global industrial businesses, financial institutions and nonprofits.
Companies aren't likely to provide all of the relevant data without a government mandate, said the director of the White House's National Economic Council, Brian Deese, who previously led BlackRock Inc.'s sustainable investing business.
"Just because a risk is material and present doesn't mean that the market left to its own devices is going to disclose that through voluntary disclosure," Mr. Deese said last month.
Some Republicans in Congress oppose the SEC initiative.
"The push for more disclosure related to global warming has little to do with providing material information for investment purposes," 12 GOP senators, including Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, wrote to the SEC on June 14. "Rather, activists with no fiduciary duty to the company or its shareholders are trying to impose their progressive political views on publicly traded companies, and the country at large, having failed to enact change via the elected government."
Defining which risks are material -- and how companies should talk about them -- has long been a source of conflict among companies, investors and regulators. The Supreme Court, in a 1976 decision, said information is material if a reasonable investor would view it as important to an investment or proxy-voting decision. The principle gives companies leeway to judge when facts or projections fit the concept, although the SEC can question those decisions.
Commissioner Hester Peirce, one of two Republicans on the five-member SEC, said she isn't convinced that regulators should mandate specific climate disclosures. If some investors want more information, they are free to seek it from companies, she said.

Full text: BRUSSELS -- President Biden and NATO allies warned about China's global influence and called Russia a threat to European and Atlantic security, as the U.S. leader sought to marshal democratic nations against autocracies and bolster an alliance jolted by broadsides from his predecessor.
Despite an atmosphere of renewed comity among allies, disputes simmer over how to balance new threats from China against more traditional ones from Russia and how to address threats in new domains including cyber and space. Turkey's increasingly discordant role in the alliance also hung over the gathering.
In a lengthy, 79-paragraph communique released Monday, China is mentioned nearly a dozen times, a shift from past North Atlantic Treaty Organization summits, when Beijing was barely mentioned.
"China's growing influence and international policies can present challenges that we need to address together as an alliance," the document states. "We will engage China with a view to defending the security interests of the alliance."
The communique says China presents "systemic challenges to the rules-based international order." NATO also mentions concerns over Beijing's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and military cooperation with Russia.
The 30-country alliance also called for "a constructive dialogue with China where possible," noting climate change as a common challenge.
The NATO communique was issued a day after leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies called on China to respect human rights, and marked an exceptional back-to-back rebuke of the country.
But Russia remains a central concern for the NATO countries. It is referred to more than 60 times in the communique, which criticizes Moscow's military buildup, cyber and disinformation attacks aimed at the West, and its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
Mr. Biden said it was too soon to say whether Ukraine should join NATO. "It depends on whether they meet the criteria," the president said, adding that the country needed to clean up corruption. The comments came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters he wanted a yes-or-no answer on whether the nation could join.
The summit also looked to the future. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said leaders agreed to develop a new strategic concept for the alliance, its main guiding document. Leaders discussed how NATO would respond to climate change, including by measuring greenhouse-gas emissions from military activities and, possibly, formulating voluntary reduction goals.
The communique says that Article 5, the principle of collective defense enshrined in the treaty that established NATO in 1949, can be invoked on a case-by-case basis in response to a cyberattack.
During Monday's summit, Mr. Biden emphasized his commitment to the principle of collective defense enshrined in Article 5, following some uncertainty about Washington's view of the matter under former President Donald Trump.
"Article Five we take as a sacred obligation," Mr. Biden said. "I want NATO to know America is there."
The summit comes two days before Mr. Biden is scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, and Mr. Biden briefed allied leaders on the meeting.
The China-related language in the NATO communique was less forceful than the G-7 document. Mr. Stoltenberg acknowledged the difficulties of finding consensus in a group with so many members.
"As always, when 30 allies need to agree, we need to balance, we need to address some differences," he said.
Mr. Biden is seeking to build a coalition of democracies to counter Chinese influence in the world. But at NATO there is some skepticism among European allies about what the role of the military alliance could be. European capitals don't want to be dragged into a confrontation between the U.S. and China.
"There are, of course, opportunities, and we need to engage with China on issues like climate change, arms control," Mr. Stoltenberg said Monday. "But China's military buildup, growing influence and coercive behavior also pose some challenges to our security."
Some allies, particularly those bordering Russia, want to ensure that a greater focus on China won't distract from the threat of an increasingly assertive Russia.
Allies also discussed the Afghanistan withdrawal, including securing the embassy presence in the country that supports the Afghan national-security forces and providing humanitarian assistance. "Our troops are coming home, but we agreed that our diplomatic, economic and humanitarian commitment for the Afghan people and our support for the Afghan National Security Forces will endure," Mr. Biden said.

Full text: President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron embraced each other, sometimes literally, as allies on a host of issues -- from multilateralism to fighting climate change at the summit of the Group of Seven leaders in Cornwall this weekend, after years of volatility between Mr. Macron and ex-President Donald Trump.
After a photo with the other world leaders next to the water on Friday, the two men, who were meeting for the first time, spoke for several minutes, smiling and patting backs.
Messrs. Biden and Macron also share a world view -- one that puts a premium on the value of multinational institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the European Union. That makes Mr. Macron perhaps the most important partner for Mr. Biden in Europe, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, another consummate internationalist, is set to leave office this year.
"I for one think the European Union is an incredibly strong and vibrant entity," Mr. Biden said on Friday sitting next to Mr. Macron.
The body language of Mr. Macron's meeting with Mr. Biden stood in contrast to his first with Mr. Trump, which featured one of the more notable handshakes in diplomatic history: a white-knuckle grasp during which Mr. Macron continued squeezing after Mr. Trump appeared to try to withdraw his hand.
Messrs. Trump and Macron later appeared to develop a bond, but in the years that followed, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the European Union, which Mr. Macron strongly supports; pulled the U.S. from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear agreement, two of Mr. Macron's top foreign-policy priorities; and placed tariffs on steel from the EU.
Mr. Biden quickly brought the U.S. back into the Paris climate accord and last week lifted sanctions on some Iranian officials. The U.S. and the EU have agreed to detente on further tariffs as talks continue.
Mr. Biden, when asked on Friday if he had convinced other G-7 leaders that the U.S. is committed to multilateralism, deferred to Mr. Macron. "Ask him," he said. "Definitely," Mr. Macron replied.

Full text: Money is pouring into stocks that get good grades on issues like building a diverse workforce and reducing carbon emissions. But figuring out how high- and low-rated companies perform is nearly impossible because of inconsistencies in the way they are rated.
A close look at the ratings and performance of stocks ranked by the three major providers of data on environmental, social and governance criteria shows that companies can have widely different ratings.
Depending on the time period and the provider, top-ranked ESG stocks either beat the market or lag behind it. Low-ranked stocks, which are generally deemed to pollute more and treat their workers less well, can outperform top-ranked ESG stocks, and the market overall.
Since company rankings vary widely depending on the provider, which groups win and which lose is inconsistent. ESG scores measure multiple factors including financial situations, the risks posed by climate change and a company's effort to mitigate them. Data providers say ESG works over the long term and investors can use scores from multiple raters to create their own strategies.
Ratings are getting new attention now because the Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing regulations around disclosure on areas like exposure to climate change and carbon emissions.
The Wall Street Journal analyzed nearly 500 U.S. companies rated by all three providers and examined their 2020 and 2021 stock performance.
The Journal sorted companies into three groups -- ESG leaders, average performers and laggards -- based on ratings assigned by Refinitiv, a data provider owned by the London Stock Exchange Group, index provider MSCI Inc., and Sustainalytics, a unit of Morningstar Inc. The Journal analyzed their performance by calculating an equal-weighted index for each category.
Shares of companies considered by Refinitiv to be poor performers on ESG metrics have jumped 26% since the beginning of this year. Companies with top marks rose by 14% in the period.
At Sustainalytics, the top-ranked companies for ESG rose 26% during the period, beating those with lower ratings. At MSCI, the average companies based on ESG scores were the winners, beating both the laggards and the leaders.
Many of the 494 companies analyzed by the Journal are large-cap companies. As a group they outperformed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average this year.
The reason for the disparity is that each rater creates scores using different data sources and procedures, often emphasizing different aspects of the companies' behavior. Some methodologies assign scores relative to competitors in the same industry and others assess absolute risk based on a firm's material exposure to ESG issues.
"Many of our institutional investor clients require multiple, diverse viewpoints on ESG to help them make more informed decisions," said Sustainalytics' executive director of methodology and portfolio research, Hendrik Garz.
Last year's performance of stocks ranked high and low on ESG criteria varied from this year's. At Refinitiv, the top scorers in 2020 beat those ranked poorly, only to lag behind them this year. For MSCI, the laggards won last year, rising 46%, and then became the losers in 2021. The average-rated companies were the winners at Sustainalytics last year.
Stocks overall performed very differently in 2020 and in 2021. Tech stocks, which tend to have higher ESG scores, surged last year as economic activity shifted online. This year more economically sensitive businesses like airlines, cruise lines and hotels rebounded.
Still, there was little consistency in how high- and low-ranked companies performed, showing that the issues with the rankings aren't linked to specific types of markets.
The rankings firms say their data are focused on longer time periods. Because the rankings reward companies that develop plans to minimize risk in areas like climate change, they have done better in bear markets, said Elena Philipova, director of sustainable finance at Refinitiv. "This is about long-term management on a much longer-term agenda like decarbonization and human capital."
Research has shown that companies with better ESG scores tend to generate better earnings over a five- to seven-year period than those with lower ESG scores, said Guido Giese, executive director of MSCI Research. "If you want to listen to the music of ESG, you need to switch to the long-wave radio."
Nearly $17 trillion in U.S. assets was held in 2020 by investors applying environmental, social and governance criteria to their portfolios, according to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.
Many companies were ranked differently by each of the rankings firms.
Refinitiv ranked Wells Fargo & Co. in the top 10% of all 917 banking services companies tracked. MSCI gave the bank an average rating and Sustainalytics ranked them poorly. The bank's stock was one of the best performing of the 494 firms scored by all three raters in the first five months of 2021, climbing 57% to $46.72, helping lift each index the Journal calculated.
A spokesman for Wells Fargo said the bank has boosted its efforts to attract shareholders focused on ESG.
Monica Billio, a professor at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy, who co-wrote a paper on ESG rankings last year, said "the strong disagreement in the market does not allow the ESG relevance to be understood by the market.
"Scores can create confusion because a company is rated highly by one agency and given a very low grade by another," she said.

Full text: PARIS -- Europe is preparing legislation that would jolt the rules of international trade by taxing imported goods based on the greenhouse gases emitted to make them, a plan that has sent shudders through the world's supply chains and unsettled big trading partners such as the U.S., Russia and China.
The European Union plan, due to be announced in July, is generating debate ahead of a summit of the leaders of the Group of Seven rich countries in southwestern England starting Friday, where the international response to climate change is set to be a central topic.
The EU proposal would open up a new front in the fight against climate change by setting the world's first limits on carbon in traded goods. The 27-nation bloc says it wants to stop polluting industries from shifting production outside Europe to avoid the bloc's emissions limits and then exporting back into the EU. The proposal would also use the EU's economic heft to send a powerful signal for countries outside the bloc to start regulating carbon emissions.
It comes as President Biden and European leaders are aiming to breathe new life into the Paris climate accord, after the Trump administration pulled the U.S. out and some European nations fell off track from their own emissions targets. The West is hoping to persuade the developing world to make ambitious new commitments to limit emissions ahead of a November summit in Scotland. John Kerry, the Biden administration's climate envoy, has said carbon-tariff proposals could undermine that process, even as the administration says it is considering whether to support the policy for the U.S.
"Secretary Kerryâ€¯recognizes that border carbon adjustments are a tool that can, under the right circumstances and if designed properly, be useful in advancing climate action," a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said.
Developing countries at a climate meeting in April called the carbon border tax a "grave concern," saying it undermines a key principle of the Paris climate agreement that poorer nations should bear less of the burden for cutting emissions than Europe and other rich countries. Manufacturers in China, India and across the developing world usually rely on coal-fired electricity; that means they would likely face a significant carbon bill on their exports to the EU.
U.S. companies worry the proposal would create a web of new red tape hindering companies' access to the European market.
The EU proposal would require European importers to buy certificates that would cover the carbon content of their imports in certain sectors, according to a draft of the legislation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. At first, the rules would apply to four heavily polluting industries: steel, aluminum, cement and fertilizer, the draft says. Other industries would be included over time. The draft says the rules could come into effect during a transitional period starting as early as 2023 and be fully in force in 2025, though officials say those dates could change in the final proposal.
The proposal would establish a new agency to enforce the rules and certify private companies that importers would need to hire to calculate the carbon content of goods produced overseas. Importers of goods covered by the levy -- called a carbon border adjustment mechanism -- would need to be authorized by the new agency, according to the draft proposal. Officials say the legislation would create a big new market for firms with the expertise to calculate the so-called carbon content of imports.
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is drafting the legislation, which must then be approved by the bloc's national governments and the European Parliament.
The idea already has broad political support across the bloc: EU member states endorsed it at a summit last year and the Parliament did so this year.

Full text: With record global temperatures stoking droughts and deadly heat waves, some scientists are eyeing audacious schemes to counteract global warming -- from erecting enormous air filters to suck carbon dioxide from the air to launching millions of sunlight-defecting space mirrors into orbit around the planet.
Other scientists see the value of simpler tools: shovels and paintbrushes.
The shovels are for planting trees, whose shade has been shown to lower air temperatures in sweltering cities by up to 45 degrees Fahrenheit; the brushes for painting rooftops and other dark surfaces light colors that limit the absorption of temperature-raising sunlight.
More trees and more reflective surfaces won't stop climate change. But they could refashion cities for a warming world, tempering what scientists call "heat islands" caused by heat-absorbing rooftops, building materials and roads that make urban areas hotter than the surrounding countryside.
In addition to lowering temperatures, trees improve air quality and help manage storm water.
Extreme heat can cause health problems ranging from exhaustion and dizziness to dehydration and even death; in recent years, heat has caused more deaths in the U.S. than hurricanes, tornadoes or floods, according to an analysis of weather-related deaths by University of Delaware scientists.
"The tree is such a fundamental and often overlooked piece of geoengineering," says Robert McDonald, an urban ecologist at the Nature Conservancy in Arlington, Va. He is a co-author of a new study showing that the starkest tree cover disparities exist in the Northeastern U.S., where low-income blocks in many communities have up to 30% less tree cover and temperatures up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than more affluent neighborhoods in the same cities.
"Every city will have to think about increasing their tree cover," says Karen Seto at Yale University, an urban geographer who is assessing urban climate change adaptation for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
In cities across the U.S., urban foresters have started planting trees by the million. Other researchers are perfecting the whitest white paint ever developed, to better reflect the sun's rays.
A newly formulated paint at Purdue University promises to provide almost as much cooling effect on the hottest days as central air conditioning, according to research published recently in the journal Applied Materials & Interfaces.
The paint reflects 98.1% of sunlight -- much more than conventional white paints. "It absorbs almost no heat from sunlight," says Xiulin Ruan, a nanotechnology engineer who led the Purdue project. "It can save up to 70% of the air conditioning cost."
The paint, based on a solution of barium sulfate particles, is being developed for commercial use. With production costs similar to those of conventional paints, Dr. Ruan says, it could become a simple way for building owners and homeowners to help climate-proof buildings.
Building owners and roofing contractors have used light-colored shingles and ceramic coatings as well as paints for more than 20 years, according to the EPA and the Cool Roof Rating Council, which assesses the heat-reflecting properties of more than 3,000 roofing materials. At least 10 companies make light-colored substitutes for asphalt aimed at lowering the temperature of paved surfaces, according to the Global Cool Cities Alliance.
Solar-reflective white roofing costs about the same as standard dark roofing material and tends to be more durable, according to studies by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and others. The new ultra-white paint still needs more testing. "Our material is safe," says Dr. Ruan. "We need to test its long-term reliability and make sure it is easy to clean and resistant to dust."
The advent of high-resolution aerial imagery and geospatial mapping of tree cover across the U.S. by the U.S. Forest Service has helped spotlight the importance of trees in urban areas -- and given cities new tools for tracking and protecting their trees.
The New York City Parks Department, for example, now maintains an online map of the location of every one of its 692,892 trees planted along streets, median strips and sidewalks, with the weeding and watering history for each as well as a cost accounting of the climate benefits it provides.
Google is working with the city of Los Angeles on an artificial intelligence system called Tree Canopy Lab that evaluates data on heat risk, population density and other factors to identify areas in need of more trees. Mayor Eric Garcetti has pledged to plant 90,000 trees by 2028 and increase shade in low-income heat zones by 50%.
"We are planting trees to address urban issues like poor air quality and the urban heat island effect, which are caused by our own human activity," says Los Angeles City Forest Officer Rachel Malarich.
Until recently, Los Angeles lost trees to development faster than it could plant new ones.
Working with the city today, USC urban climate scientists are using air sensors and temperature data to pinpoint places where new trees would be most beneficial. "Sometimes there is a 40-degree Fahrenheit difference under a tree and standing in the middle of the street 30 feet away," says John Wilson, director of the university's Spatial Sciences Institute and a leader of its Urban Trees Initiative.
USC scientists recently studied more than a thousand streets in a city where prolonged heat waves have tripled during the past century -- and found that nearly a third had no trees at all. By 2060, the city could see temperatures of 95 degrees Fahrenheit or higher on up to 40 days a year, according to climate projections by the American Meteorological Society and the University of California Los Angeles.
"Dropping city temperatures by one or two degrees could be substantial, and trees can do that," says David Nowak, a senior scientist at the U.S. Forest Service. "If I could plant only one tree in the world, I would plant it in an urban center."
As they work to increase the number of trees, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and other cities have enacted building codes to encourage contractors and homeowners to paint roofs and resurface streets and sidewalks with highly reflective paints and coatings.
"Cities are altering their own climate through land use changes and emission of waste heat," says Brian Stone, director of the Urban Climate Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology and author of "The City and the Coming Climate: Climate Change in the Places We Live." "But that also gives cities direct control over their future warming."
Such efforts come amid reports on rising global temperatures and their pernicious effects on city dwellers.
Rising temperatures last year capped the world's warmest decade in modern times, driven by rising levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, according to independent assessments of global temperature changes by the U.S., Europe and Japan. And global averages mask the special problem of rising temperatures in urban areas, scientists say.
Temperatures in cities have risen at more than double the rate of planetary warming since 1960, according to an analysis of temperature trends in 50 major U.S. cities published recently in the journal Landscape and Urban Planning. Other studies showed that a city of a million people can be 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the surrounding countryside, with a nighttime temperature difference of up to 22 degrees. Climate scientists say that is the result of concentrations of dark-colored, heat-absorbing rooftops, building materials and roads in urban areas.
As a result, urban heat waves are becoming longer, more frequent and more intense, affecting people in low-income neighborhoods more severely than people in affluent areas, according to new studies by the EPA and others. Compounding the risk to city dwellers, urban power outages -- and the resulting loss of air conditioning -- have doubled in the past five years, according to a study published recently in Environmental Science & Technology.
But the new focus on trees and a brighter urban palette is raising hopes for more livable and more resilient urban areas.
"It's part of an emerging, climate-oriented way to manage a city," says Dr. Stone.

Full text: LONDON -- Royal Dutch Shell PLC said it would accelerate its efforts to cut its carbon emissions in the wake of a Dutch court ruling last month ordering the oil giant to take more drastic action.
In a post on LinkedIn on Wednesday, Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said Shell disagreed with the ruling and still expected to appeal the court's order to curb emissions by 45% by 2030, but nonetheless would rise to the challenge of doing more.
"Now we will seek ways to reduce emissions even further in a way that remains purposeful and profitable. That is likely to mean taking some bold but measured steps over the coming years," Mr. van Beurden said.
Shell in February set out plans to gradually reduce its oil output by 1% to 2% a year and expand in areas including electricity and biofuels. Other big oil companies have pledged to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and invest more in low-carbon energy amid growing pressure from activists, investors and governments.
Mr. van Beurden didn't elaborate on what actions the company might take or to what extent it would speed up its pivot to lower-carbon energy. Shell declined to comment further on his comments.
The district court in The Hague, ruling in a case brought by environmental organizations, said its decision was based on broadly accepted United Nations guidance aimed at limiting global warming and human-rights-related law that is similar across Europe. The ruling could set a precedent, at least in Europe, that individual companies bear a legal responsibility to protect people from climate change.
"I still feel disappointed that Shell is being singled out by a ruling that I believe does not help reduce global CO2 emissions," said Mr. van Beurden, adding that the company expects to produce oil and gas for a long time to come.
If Shell pursues an appeal, the case could take around one to two years to be heard, after which it could be further appealed in the Dutch supreme court. The district court said last month that its order would stand provisionally, despite acknowledging potentially far-reaching consequences for Shell that might be difficult to undo.
Friends of the Earth Netherlands, the environmental nonprofit that brought the case, said it welcomed Mr. van Beurden's comments but called on the company to take more aggressive action.
Shell has previously said it estimates its carbon emissions peaked in 2018 and that it plans to reduce the carbon intensity -- the volume of carbon per unit of energy -- of the products it sells by 20% by 2030 and 100% by 2050.

Full text: VICE PRESIDENT
Harris Meets Leader
Of Guatemala
Vice President Kamala Harris offered an optimistic outlook for improved cooperation with Guatemala on addressing the spike in migration to the U.S. after her meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on Monday. She also delivered a direct warning to migrants considering making the trek: "Do not come. Do not come."
Her comments, during a press conference after she met privately with the Guatemalan president, underscored the challenge that remains even as Ms. Harris engages in substantive talks with the Guatemalan and Mexican presidents during a three-day visit to the region this week, her first foreign trip as vice president.
"I want to emphasize that the goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home," Ms. Harris said. "At the same time, I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come, do not come."
In conjunction with Ms. Harris's trip, the Biden administration announced the Justice Department would create an anticorruption task force and an additional task force to combat human trafficking and drug smuggling in the region. Ms. Harris also promised a new program focused on creating education and economic opportunities for girls there, among other new initiatives.

BOSTON
Police Chief Fired
Over Allegations
Boston's police commissioner was fired Monday following a bitter battle to keep his job after decades-old domestic violence accusations came to light.
Acting Mayor Kim Janey announced Dennis White's removal as the city's top cop, four months after Mr. White was placed on leave over the allegations just days into his new job.
Ms. Janey said Mr. White failed to fully cooperate with the city's investigation into the claims and was a "reoccurring presence" at police headquarters while on leave, creating confusion for officers and fostering "a climate of intimidation" within the force.
Mr. White had tried to go to court to block his firing, calling the allegations false and saying the mayor has no cause to terminate him. Mr. White's attorney slammed Ms. Janey's decision and signaled the former commissioner's litigation against the city would continue.
Mr. White -- a 32-year veteran of the department who replaced William Gross, the city's first Black police commissioner -- was suspended after the Boston Globe raised questions about allegations found in court documents from 1999 that Mr. White pushed and threatened to shoot his then-wife, a fellow police officer.
Mr. White has vehemently denied ever engaging in domestic violence, and accused his ex-wife of lying to get a financial advantage in their divorce.

NOAA
CO2 Levels 50% Over
Preindustrial Age
The annual peak of global heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air has reached another dangerous milestone: 50% higher than when the industrial age began.
And the average rate of increase is faster than ever, scientists reported Monday.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the average carbon dioxide level for May was 419.13 parts per million. That is 1.82 parts per million higher than May 2020 and 50% higher than the stable preindustrial levels of 280 parts per million, said NOAA climate scientist Pieter Tans.
Carbon dioxide levels peak every May just before plant life in the Northern Hemisphere blossoms, sucking some of that carbon out of the atmosphere and into flowers, leaves, seeds and stems. The reprieve is temporary, though, because emissions of carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and natural gas for transportation and electricity far exceed what plants can take in, pushing greenhouse gas levels to records every year.
"Reaching 50% higher carbon dioxide than preindustrial is really setting a new benchmark and not in a good way," said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the research. "If we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, we need to work much harder to cut carbon-dioxide emissions and right away."
Climate change does more than increase temperatures. It makes extreme weather -- storms, wildfires, floods and droughts -- worse and more frequent and causes oceans to rise and get more acidic, studies show. There are also health effects, including heat deaths and increased pollen.

CALIFORNIA
Two Arrested in
Road-Rage Death
A man and a woman have been arrested in connection with a road-rage shooting that killed a 6-year-old boy last month on a Southern California freeway, authorities said.
Marcus Anthony Eriz, 24 years old, and Wynne Lee, 23, were detained Sunday outside a home in Costa Mesa south of Los Angeles, the California Highway Patrol said in a statement.
Aiden Leos was fatally shot in the abdomen on May 21 while seated in the back seat of a car driven by his mother, Joanna Cloonan in the city of Orange.
Highway patrol officials said the road-rage incident stemmed from "a perceived unsafe lane change."

Full text: A court decision ordering Royal Dutch Shell PLC to cut its carbon emissions has emboldened litigants in similar cases, including two that could have big implications for Exxon Mobil Corp. and French oil giant Total.
Companies in various industries have already grasped the ruling's potential ripple effects, such as whether they will need to speed up plans to reduce their emissions, lawyers said, and are seeking advice on whether it could apply outside the Netherlands. The ruling could set a precedent, at least in Europe, that individual companies bear a legal responsibility to protect people from climate change.
Shell's defeat comes as oil-and-gas companies face growing scrutiny over their emissions from activists, governments and investors, and adds momentum to other climate-related suits where the legal system or arguments are similar, plaintiffs and legal experts said.
Other cases using similar arguments to target oil companies have faced setbacks, however, while some lawyers and analysts think Shell could successfully appeal the decision and question the court's jurisdiction over the company's global strategy.
Shell has said it plans to appeal the verdict, a process that could take years.
The ruling's influence could soon be put to the test in France, where environmental groups and local authorities have filed a similar case targeting TotalEnergies SE -- the energy company known until last month as Total.
A judicial court in Nanterre, a Paris suburb near the company's headquarters, is set to rule in September whether it can move forward with the case. The suit seeks to force TotalEnergies to immediately cease exploration and cut emissions by reducing oil production by 37% by 2030, from 2010 levels.
Paul Mougeolle, a legal adviser at Notre Affaire a Tous, an environmental nonprofit that is the lead plaintiff in the case, said the group had coordinated early on with the complainants in the Dutch case to formulate a common legal strategy.
The Dutch and French complaints both rely on what is known as "duty of care" legislation, which requires that companies ensure that their operations don't harm citizens, including through climate change, Mr. Mougeolle said.
TotalEnergies, which declined to comment on the case, has challenged the court's competency to handle the suit, saying it should be dealt with by a commercial tribunal.
Friends of the Earth Netherlands, the nonprofit that sued Shell, said it has started preparations to target companies beyond the energy sector, focusing on Dutch businesses with global operations. It has also shared translations of legal documents with similar organizations in other countries.
"What we are now doing is seeing where there are other sectors with a global footprint that need an extra push in order to go the extra mile," said Donald Pols, the group's director.
Overall there are around 1,800 lawsuits related to climate world-wide, according to a database produced by Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, most of which are in the U.S.
Yet legal experts don't expect the Shell ruling to have a big influence in the U.S. American law is likely to be less favorable to environmental groups, they said, because, unlike European courts, most federal courts haven't recognized a constitutional right to a clean environment.
Local governments in the U.S. have instead tried to use common-law nuisance claims to force companies to pay the costs of adapting to the effects of climate change. Most of those cases are pending.
Should a case end up at the Supreme Court, the conservative-leaning panel could be skeptical of allowing cities to get involved in regulating global matters, said Rachel Rothschild, a legal fellow at the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law.
The Dutch court ruling against Shell found that the company contributed to climate change and ordered it to cut emissions by 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The court decision was based on broadly accepted United Nations guidance aimed at limiting global warming and human-rights-related law that is similar across Europe.
Litigants and legal experts said the ruling also encourages plaintiffs in a recently filed case targeting a major Exxon-led oil project in Guyana, where a consortium has already initiated production and poured $10 billion into the country.
Last month, two citizens sued the government in the South American country's constitutional court, seeking to block all oil production. The plaintiffs argued that the project would worsen climate change and violated the government's legal duty to protect citizens' rights to a healthy environment.
"The Shell case is extremely relevant for Guyana," said Carroll Muffett, chief executive of the Center for International Environmental Law, a not-for-profit law firm that studies climate-change jurisprudence. He said both cases center on using the U.N.'s climate-change framework to hold entities accountable for human rights.
Melinda Janki, the plaintiffs' lead lawyer in the Guyana case, said she was encouraged because the Dutch case prevailed using similar arguments to her strategy. She estimates that the Exxon discoveries of nine billion barrels of oil will generate about 3.87 gigatons of carbon emissions.
The litigation is "about stopping a massive increase in carbon emission, a carbon bomb," she said. Ms. Janki said much of Guyana's coastline is at risk of flooding because it is below sea level, making it "one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change."
An aide to Guyana Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo, who is in charge of oil matters, declined to comment. The first hearing in the case has yet to take place.
A spokesman for Exxon, which isn't a defendant in the case, said the company complies with all applicable laws in Guyana, and that the oil giant already has plans to reduce emissions.

Full text: MOAPA VALLEY, Nev. -- This windswept desert community is full of clean energy supporters including Suzanne Rebich, an airline pilot who recently topped her house with 36 solar panels. About 200 homes generate their own solar energy and a quarter of the local electricity supply comes from hydroelectric power.
All the same, many here are dead set against a planned solar plant atop the Mormon Mesa, which overlooks this valley 50 miles northeast of Las Vegas. Slated to be the biggest solar plant in the U.S., the Battle Born Solar Project by California-based Arevia Power would carpet 14 square miles -- the equivalent of 7,000 football fields -- with more than a million solar panels 10 to 20 feet tall. It would be capable of producing 850 megawatts of electricity, or roughly one-tenth of Nevada's current capacity.
"It will destroy this land forever," Ms. Rebich, 33, said after riding her bicycle on the 600-foot high mesa.
Across the U.S., more than 800 utility-scale solar projects are under contract to generate nearly 70,000 megawatts of new capacity, enough to power more than 11 million homes, equivalent to Texas and then some. More than half this capacity is being planned for the American Southwest, with its abundance of sunshine and open land.
These large projects are increasingly drawing opposition from environmental activists and local residents who say they are ardent supporters of clean energy. Their objections range from a desire to keep the land unspoiled to protection for endangered species to concerns that their views would no longer be as beautiful.
Unlike past fights between polluting industries and environmentalists, this one pits people who say they want more renewable power against companies that want to generate it. It threatens to significantly slow efforts by the Biden administration and businesses to fight climate change by reducing America's carbon emissions.
"An energy system based on renewables is still an industrial-scale system, with large generation and transmission projects that people don't necessarily want in their neighborhoods," said Samantha Gross, director of the Energy Security and Climate Initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.
Conservationists say clean energy shouldn't come at the cost of damaging the environment or threatening endangered species. The Sierra Club, which describes itself as "a relentless advocate for the decarbonization of the electric grid via renewable energy sources," is one of several environmental groups opposing a 690-megawatt solar plant on prime desert tortoise habitat off Interstate 15 about 35 miles northeast of Las Vegas.
The $1 billion project, known as Gemini, would, like Battle Born, be developed by Glendale, Calif.-based Arevia and connect to the NV Energy Inc. transmission system.
Solar generation has grown to 4.5% of the nation's electricity supply from 0.1% in 2010, due largely to plummeting prices for equipment. Producing utility-scale solar is now similar to or below the cost of gas and all other energy technologies, even before including government incentives, according to investment bank Lazard Ltd.
Expanding solar and wind power is part of President Biden's plan to convert the nation's power grid to 100% renewable energy by 2035. One of the biggest obstacles is local residents and environmental groups that can tie up projects in regulatory reviews or courts for years. Already, activists have blocked or are seeking to block projects in Nevada, Washington, Indiana and Virginia.
San Bernardino County, Calif., which lists renewable energy as a foundation of its move toward sustainable development, in 2019 put the brakes on new proposals for large solar projects near more than a dozen rural communities, where residents complained of potential dust.
"There were tons of these proposed, so the communities got together and started to fight back," said Brian Hammer, a leader of the fight to stop solar plants in the Lucerne Valley, where three would have nearly encircled his desert home.
Solar-industry executives say they construct their projects responsibly and that building them fast can help combat climate change. "Responsibly developing solar and storage projects on public lands delivers tremendous benefits to the region, state and everyone wanting to preserve this valuable ecosystem," Ricardo Graf, managing partner of Arevia, said in a written statement.
A spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, which oversees public land where 81 applications for solar plants are pending, said the agency works with residents, interest groups and other affected parties "to develop mitigations which allow solar projects while protecting resources."
The BLM is charged under the Energy Act of 2020 with permitting at least 25,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2025. The agency now has 6,900 megawatts in operation, enough to power 1.1 million homes.
Solar power plants have faced opposition from activists and politicians from both parties since the industry's early days. In 2009, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- a longtime supporter of renewable energy -- introduced a bill to create the Mojave Trails National Monument on one million acres to safeguard pristine desert where several solar plants had been planned. The bill didn't try to stop those plants altogether, just redirect them onto private property and public lands that had already been disturbed, such as by grazing. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law in 2016.
Sen. Feinstein has backed clean energy projects in parts of the desert that need less conservation, such as are allowed in a 2016 state-federal agreement called the Desert Renewable Conservation Plan. "It's important to understand that we don't have to choose to either protect the desert or build more clean energy infrastructure -- we can and already are doing both," she said in a written statement.
Recently, Nevada has gone all in on solar development. On Earth Day of 2019, Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, signed a bill to increase Nevada's renewable energy portfolio to 50% by 2030 -- one of the most ambitious targets in the nation.
Over the past five years, more than 50 solar plants have been built in Nevada with generating capacity of about 1,000 megawatts, enough to power Reno. Another two dozen totaling more than 3,500 megawatts are in the planning stage, led by Gemini and Battle Born.
Both projects had been in the offing under different companies since 2007, but didn't gain momentum until the current push for clean energy. Gemini was put on a regulatory fast track. It drew opposition from environmental groups and the Moapa Band of Paiutes, whose reservation sits next to the proposed solar plant along Interstate 15 about 35 miles east of Las Vegas.
"This is a clear environmental justice issue that cannot go unaddressed," the tribe said in an Oct. 10, 2019, letter to Bureau of Land Management officials, citing impacts including noise, dust and damage to its ancestral homeland.
Tribal members say they support solar power, noting that they allowed a 250-megawatt facility to be built on their lands in 2017.
Kevin Emmerich, co-founder of the Nevada-based Basin and Range Watch environmental group, is a longtime supporter of solar energy. He once fried an egg on the pavement at Death Valley National Park when he worked there as a park ranger. "It's something you have to do," he said.
Mr. Emmerich also believes big solar projects represent a threat to a desert landscape he has worked for decades to protect. In particular, he worries about the impact on the threatened desert tortoise, a reclusive creature whose shrinking habitat is imperiled by development, according to federal studies.
At a July 23, 2019, public hearing in Las Vegas, Mr. Emmerich suggested the panels needed to run the Gemini plant could instead be installed atop buildings in Las Vegas -- a possibility industry officials call too spread out to be economical. "Approving this project would be a shame," he said. "You shouldn't do it."
The Interior Department in May 2020 approved the project anyway, stipulating Arevia Power would have to take mitigation measures such as relocating tortoises to new habitat. In all, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report estimates 15,390 of the threatened turtles stand to lose nearly 70,000 acres of habitat in solar projects planned for the Southwestern deserts.
Mr. Graf said Arevia intends to work with federal agencies to protect both the tortoises and native plants at this and other projects and that they will have "far less impact" on the desert than off-road vehicle use.
About 15 miles to the east, the roughly 10,000 residents of the three main Moapa Valley towns -- Overton, Logandale and Moapa -- are determined to avoid a similar fate for Battle Born.
Founded in the 19th century as an outpost of Mormon settlers, the valley in recent decades has become home to a mix of commuters, retirees and tourism businesses. The valley went through a slump 10 years ago, following the 2007-09 recession and closure of nearby boating facilities amid falling levels at Lake Mead.
But since then, it has been on the rebound, with the Mormon Mesa drawing four-wheelers, bicyclists and skydivers onto its plateau of yucca and creosote. The mesa is filled with Native American artifacts and features a 1,500-foot trench called the Double Negative, created in 1969 by artist Michael Heizer as one of the world's largest pieces of land art.
Kyle Grimes is one of relatively few local residents who publicly support Battle Born, as well as Gemini, which he says are needed "just to get away from the fossil fuel." But the business consultant said he would like to see Battle Born moved off areas of the mesa where people recreate.
More common are the local residents who formed a group called Save Our Mesa and began campaigning against the site on Facebook, in sign-waving protests and at a public meeting held at a community center in Overton last October. Among their other concerns: more dust and hotter temperatures from the solar operation, as well as destruction of the mesa and the tourism industry it supports. "We don't want to be the guinea pigs," Lisa Childs, co-founder of the citizens group, said in the meeting.
Mr. Graf told the overflowing room of about 200 people it was still early in the process but that Battle Born would be built in an environmentally friendly way and that benefits to the community would include more than 1,000 jobs, mostly in the construction.
Mr. Graf challenged the concerns on dust, heat and economic harm -- saying the plant's footprint would take up less than a tenth of the mesa's 200 square mile area.
For now, the opponents have gained a delay in the permitting for Battle Born. On a mild February morning, Ms. Childs and other project opponents headed up to Mormon Mesa in their gasoline-powered all-terrain vehicles to inspect favorite overlooks that they fear will be forever marred.
"Once it's done," said Ms. Childs, with her engine switched off, "it can't be undone."

Full text: An activist investor is likely to pick up a third seat on the board of Exxon Mobil Corp., giving it additional leverage to press the oil giant to address investor discontent about diminished profits and its fossil-fuel focused strategy amid concerns about climate change.
Exxon said Wednesday that an updated vote count showed shareholders backed a third nominee of Engine No. 1, an upstart hedge fund that had already won two board seats at Exxon's annual shareholder meeting last week. The final vote hasn't been certified, Exxon said, and could take days or weeks to be finalized, according to people familiar with the matter.
Engine No. 1, which owns a tiny fraction of Exxon's stock, had sought four seats on the board and argued the Texas oil giant should commit to carbon neutrality, effectively bringing its emissions to zero -- both from the company and its products -- by 2050, as some peers have. If the preliminary voting results hold, it will control a quarter of Exxon's 12-person board.
The vote culminated one of the most expensive proxy fights ever. It puts new pressure on Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods, who personally campaigned against Engine No. 1, and could complicate his plans to maintain Exxon as the largest Western oil producer. Mr. Woods was re-elected to the board along with eight of Exxon's candidates.
"We look forward to working with all of our directors to build on the progress we've made to grow long-term shareholder value and succeed in a lower-carbon future," Mr. Woods said.
Though Engine No. 1 only owned 0.02% of Exxon's stock, it was able to capitalize on investors' concerns about Exxon's recent performance and climate-change strategy. Exxon posted a $22 billion loss for last year, its largest on record, after the pandemic crushed fuel demand and upended what turned out to be an ill-timed plan by Mr. Woods to substantially increase spending to boost oil and gas production.
Many of the world's biggest investment firms helped elect the fund's directors, including BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group, who said publicly they wielded votes for investors in favor of at least two dissident directors.
Vanguard voted for two directors proposed by the activist and said it had expressed concerns to Exxon for years about the independence of Exxon's board and its directors' lack of energy sector expertise.
"And for years, we did not witness sufficient progress on either front," Vanguard said last week.
Engine No. 1 has called for Exxon to gradually diversify its investments to be ready for a world that will need fewer fossil fuels in the coming decades. It criticized Exxon's board for presiding over years of poor financial returns and for its unwillingness to reconsider the company's long-held view that oil and gas demand will remain robust for decades.
"We are grateful for shareholders' careful consideration of our nominees and are excited that these three individuals will be working with the full board to help better position Exxon Mobil for the long-term benefit of all shareholders," an Engine No. 1 spokeswoman said.
The hedge fund's third successful nominee is Alexander Karsner, a former U.S. assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy and a current senior strategist at X, formerly known as Google X, a subsidiary of tech giant Alphabet Inc.
Mr. Karsner joins Engine No. 1's two other successful candidates, Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala. Mr. Goff is the former CEO of Andeavor, which was one the largest U.S. refiners before being purchased for more than $20 billion by Marathon Petroleum Corp. in 2018, while Ms. Hietala is a former executive vice president of renewable products at Finnish refiner Neste Oyj.
Engine No. 1's fourth candidate, Anders Runevad, the former CEO of Vestas Wind Systems, appeared to come up short, according to the preliminary vote count.
Exxon said in a regulatory filing Wednesday that about 67.1% of the vote from its more than 4.2 million shares had been counted.
According to the preliminary count, Exxon also lost on two shareholders proposals it had asked investors to vote against but were supported by institutional investors.
Shareholders representing nearly 56% of shares that were eligible to vote supported a proposal calling for Exxon to disclose more about direct and indirect lobbying spending and policies, while about 64% voted for Exxon to release a report on how its lobbying aligns with Paris climate accords.
Exxon has expressed public support for the Paris Agreement and had pledged to further reduce emissions from its operations.

Cities, States Wage Battle Over Banning Gas in Homes

Full text: A growing fight is unfolding across the U.S. as cities consider phasing out natural gas for home cooking and heating, citing concerns about climate change, and states push back against these bans.
Major cities including San Francisco, Seattle, Denver and New York have either enacted or proposed measures to ban or discourage the use of the fossil fuel in new homes and buildings, two years after Berkeley, Calif., passed the first such prohibition in the U.S. in 2019.
The bans in turn have led Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Kansas and Louisiana to enact laws outlawing such municipal prohibitions in their states before they can spread, arguing that they are overly restrictive and costly. Ohio is considering a similar measure.
The outcome of the battle, largely among Democratic-led cities and Republican-run states, has the potential to reshape the future of the utility industry and demand for natural gas, which the U.S. produces more of than any other country.
Proponents of phasing out natural gas said they aim to reduce planet-warming emissions over time by fully electrifying new homes and buildings as wind and solar farms proliferate throughout the country, making the power grid cleaner.
Homes and businesses account for about 13% of the nation's annual greenhouse-gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, mostly because natural gas is used in cooking, heating, and washers and dryers. Climate activists said reducing that percentage is critical for states with goals to slash carbon emissions in the coming decades.
Opponents in the gas industry counter by citing the higher costs of making many homes fully electric and pointing to the added security of having a second home energy source to heat and cook with during extreme weather events. They also highlight the preference many home and professional chefs have for using gas-fired stoves.
New all-electric homes are cost-competitive with those that use gas in many parts of the country, but retrofits can be considerably more expensive, depending on the existing heating and cooking systems and the cost of effectively converting them. A recent study by San Francisco found that retrofitting all housing units that now use natural gas would cost between $3.4 billion and $5.9 billion, costs that would fall on residents, the city or both.
Induction ranges, which use magnets to heat pots and pans directly, can be more expensive to buy than gas ranges, especially in professional kitchens. Restaurant associations across the nation have raised concerns about going electric.
Utilities that supply both electricity and natural gas could face more muted impacts if the shift accelerates. But those that supply only natural gas face the prospect of slower growth or even a reversal of demand, especially if momentum builds to electrify both new and existing homes.
Greater reliance on electricity raises the possibility that parts of the natural-gas delivery system will become stranded assets, facilities that retire before they pay for themselves. The Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, warned in 2019 that in California, where gas utilities spend billions of dollars on their systems each year, stranded assets could complicate efforts to move away from gas by saddling customers with higher costs over time.
President Biden's $1.7 trillion infrastructure plan calls for greater adoption of all-electric heat pumps and induction stoves, giving proponents hope that the government will do more to incentivize their adoption.
Panama Bartholomy, director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition, which supports efforts to electrify buildings throughout California, said the organization is pushing for the state to cut emissions from homes and businesses by 40% by 2030 and to adopt zero-emission building codes for each within the next few years.
"All of a sudden there's a conversation happening that wasn't happening two years ago," Mr. Bartholomy said. "It's the fastest-growing trend we've ever seen."
Industry pushback has been swift, with many utilities and businesses opposing local gas bans.
Arizona became last year the first state to pass pre-emptive legislation barring municipalities from banning new gas hookups. The Arizona Chamber of Commerce helped lead a coalition of businesses that pushed for the legislation, even though no bans were under consideration in the state at the time. Garrick Taylor, the chamber's interim chief executive, said the legislation was born of concerns that bans would result in higher electricity costs and reduced energy choices for residents and businesses.
"If you see something next door in California, there's a chance that a municipality in your state is likely going to consider it," Mr. Taylor said.
The American Gas Association, a national lobbying group, has been pushing for state laws prohibiting local bans. President Karen Harbert said an indiscriminate approach to widespread electrification could put strain on the grid, resulting in either higher electricity prices or greater reliance on gas-fired power plants.
"You have to do the math," she said. "We can't just say if we electrify everything, we're going to solve the challenge of climate change."
State agencies in California, Colorado, Massachusetts and New York have launched efforts to assess how the role of gas utilities might change in the coming years if demand plateaus or declines. Utilities across the country are beginning to ask the same question as they consider new gas investments.
Jan Berman, director of energy strategy and innovation at PG&E Corp., which serves 16 million people in northern and central California, said it might eventually shrink its gas- distribution system, if more homes are retrofitted to run entirely on electricity.
"We welcome the opportunity to avoid investments in new gas assets that might later prove to be underutilized as decarbonization efforts progress here in California," she said.

Full text: Many of the world's biggest investment firms helped elect directors proposed by an upstart environmental-activist fund to Exxon Mobil Corp.'s board. While votes are still being counted, BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group have said publicly they wielded votes for investors in favor of at least two dissident directors.
The proxy battle was the biggest test yet of Wall Street's receptivity to a campaign about the risks posed to business from climate change and the transition away from fossil fuels. Large investors have been criticized for being all talk and no action on getting the companies they invest in to change their policies around sustainability. Exxon's yearslong refusal to make board directors available for frank conversations irked investors.
Energy giant Exxon fought hard to fend off the dissident slate. Company officials continued to lobby shareholders even as Wednesday's annual meeting neared adjournment.
Exxon said it welcomed the new directors, Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, and looked forward to working with them. "With almost three million shareholders, it's not surprising we heard a wide range of views, and many supported the work that we're doing to improve earnings and cash flow capacity, as well as the work to advance the company to a lower carbon future," a spokesman said. "Today, we heard shareholders communicate a desire for ExxonMobil to further these efforts. We're well-positioned to do that."
The vote is expected to draw the lines between funds willing to take a more aggressive posture on climate issues and those that are more reticent.
"This moment is a big victory for what was a fringe environmental activist movement a few years ago," said Jonathon Zytnick, research fellow at New York University School of Law's Institute for Corporate Governance & Finance.
Exxon was an easy villain for Wall Street to rally against. Climate activists have painted it as a symbol of American excesses that contributed to climate change, and the company was coming off a tough period financially.
With only a roughly $50 million stake in the $250 billion energy company, Engine No. 1 ran a six-month, $30 million campaign centered on pushing the oil giant to commit to carbon neutrality. It had a powerful ally. California State Teachers' Retirement System, the nation's second largest public pension fund, pledged support from the start.
Institutional investors only get the chance to formally weigh in on high-profile proxy contests every few years, given that most companies avoid drawn-out battles with activists by striking settlements ahead of shareholder votes.
It was the third time the nation's largest public pension fund, California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, faced off against the company in the past decade. Along the way, Exxon often fought off dialogue between the board and its largest shareholders, said Anne Simpson, head of corporate governance at the pension fund. "It has been like pulling teeth to get Exxon directors to talk to investors," Ms. Simpson said.
An Exxon spokesman said the firm has been "very actively engaged with our shareholders, sharing our plans and hearing their viewpoints and the key issues of importance to them."
New York State Common Retirement Fund joined Calpers in pledging support for Engine No. 1's candidates.
Calpers said it publicly backed the activist campaign because it believed Exxon had repeatedly failed to address the lack of energy-industry experience on the board.
BlackRock voted for three directors proposed by Engine No. 1 and expressed concerns with Exxon's strategic direction and the impact on its financial performance in the long term.
Vanguard voted for two directors proposed by the activist. "Over the years, we have shared with Exxon our concerns about the lack of energy sector expertise in its boardroom and questions about board independence," Vanguard wrote in a bulletin. "And for years, we did not witness sufficient progress on either front."
Exxon added two directors to its board earlier this year, saying they were part of a continuing effort to refresh the board and reflected ongoing talks with investors.
At least some Fidelity funds voted for Engine No. 1 directors, according to people familiar with the matter. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. voted for three of the four dissident directors, the company said.
"There are many reasons you may have wanted to hold Exxon accountable for many years," said Jessica Strine, chief executive of advisory firm Sustainable Governance Partners. "This is the moment for many investors where they had to decide if they would let it pass by or not."
On Wednesday, Exxon's annual shareholders meeting stretched for hours.
There was some confusion around the votes from State Street Global Advisors, the asset management division of State Street Corp. Early this week, preliminary vote tallies indicated it was backing three dissident shareholders, people familiar with the matter said.
A spokesman for State Street said the firm reached a final decision to go with two dissident directors on Tuesday.
A State Street spokesman said the firm was never pressured to change its votes.
The votes are still being tallied by an independent party now, and Engine No. 1 could yet pick up another seat in coming weeks.
For Engine No. 1, launched by investor Chris James with roughly $250 million under management, the campaign was a referendum on its focus of combining environmental concerns with a company's financial outlook.
"It's not like we were asking people to take off their investor hats. We were just making the case that as long-term investors they should support us," said Charlie Penner, who helmed Engine No. 1's campaign.

Full text: A Dutch court's demand that Royal Dutch Shell PLC slash carbon emissions is casting a spotlight on how investors approach oil companies and their strategies to manage climate risks.
In one corner of the market -- bonds issued by oil companies including Shell -- investors appear to be juggling their holdings to get ahead of possible changes.
The development of climate change as a factor for investors to consider is shaking the investment world. The Dutch court ruled on Wednesday that Shell must cut its emissions by 45% by 2030, a move that amps up the pressure to decarbonize. Shell said it plans to appeal.
On the same day, Exxon Mobil Corp. shareholders elected board members nominated by an activist investor that wants the oil company to prepare for a post-fossil-fuel world.
Those decisions echo forces already creating new dynamics in how investors look at fossil-fuel companies.
The change is nascent and most noticeable among European oil companies, whose bonds have lost value even as crude prices have soared. In addition to pressure from shareholders and activists who pushed the Shell and Exxon cases, debt investors say they are trying to get ahead of possible moves by the European Central Bank, Bank of England and other central banks to favor sustainable companies in their bond-buying programs.
"When you take a look at where energy spreads are trading in the context of the recovery and commodity prices rising, there's clearly something holding energy spreads back," said Stephen Caprio, a global credit strategist at UBS.
Brent, the global benchmark for oil prices, is up 34% this year. In the same period, the spread or extra yield over Treasurys on bonds issued by European oil firms has also climbed, indicating investors view them as riskier than other assets.
That spread widening is unusual. In the past, energy company bond yields have tended to tighten when oil prices rise and widen when they fall. Higher crude prices mean more cash flow for the companies that issue the bonds, making them more creditworthy. When bond yields fall, bond prices go up.
An index of euro-denominated debt issued by energy companies saw its spread at 1.03 percentage points on Wednesday compared with 0.82 point for a broader index of euro debt issued by nonfinancial companies. The difference between the two has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, according to analysis by UBS.
Yields on debt issued by oil giants such as BP PLC and Total SE have risen this year faster than comparable nonenergy bonds. A bond issued by Shell that matures in 2031 saw its yield edge up to 0.56% on Wednesday from 0.22% at the end of last year. Equivalent bonds issued by Total and BP also made similar moves.
This is despite targets set by these companies to try to reduce their carbon emissions and become net zero by 2050.
Behind the moves in yields, some investors point to the outsize role of central banks in bond markets.
Christine Lagarde and other ECB policy makers have said that the central bank is assessing its potential role in reducing carbon emissions in the economy as part of a major review of its policies set to come out this year. It is considering whether to factor climate risks into its corporate bond-buying program. It seeks to buy bonds evenly across the market.
In the U.K., the Bank of England said it plans to adjust its corporate bond-buying program to account for the climate impact of issuers. The government in March directed the BOE to expand its mandate beyond price stability to also drive the U.K. economy to be net zero, meaning the country's carbon emissions are fully offset.
"We have seen central banks, literally around the world, now putting climate change as one of their top priorities," said Sonja Laud, chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management. She said she is anticipating market pricing of assets to increasingly reflect the extent to which the companies are working to pollute less.
"We will see a far greater difference in pricing and in the cost of capital for companies that are aligned versus those that are not," she said.
Central banks are a major source of demand in the bond market, especially since the pandemic began. The ECB purchased about 86 billion euros, equivalent to $105 billion, of corporate bonds last year and the Bank of England snapped up GBP 9.5 billion, equivalent to $13.4 billion, through its stimulus programs.
"The direction of travel with the central banks can really move the needle, given the size of the asset base you're talking about," said Fraser Lundie, head of credit at Federated Hermes. He recently cut holdings of bonds issued by heavy carbon emitters. Pension funds and insurers are also shifting money into funds that consider a company's record on the environment.

Full text: To comply with a Dutch court order to cut carbon emissions, Royal Dutch Shell PLC may have to overhaul its business and cut its oil output faster than it had planned, analysts and investors said.
Potential ways to curb emissions include selling assets, rethinking exploration spending and halting growth of its liquefied-natural gas operations, they said.
Shell faces the potential upheaval after the district court in The Hague on Wednesday ruled that the company is partially responsible for climate change and must reduce its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels.
That target, which was called for by the environmental groups that brought the case, is in line with United Nations guidance for member states aimed at preventing global temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
Shell said it was disappointed and fully expected to appeal the decision, and that it is already investing billions of dollars in low-carbon energy, including electric-vehicle charging, biofuels and renewables.
"We are carefully reviewing the court's written judgment and the questions it raises," a Shell spokeswoman said.
If Shell pursues an appeal, the case would be referred to a court of appeal where it can take around one to two years to be heard, after which it can be further appealed in the Dutch supreme court. The court on Wednesday said its order would stand provisionally, despite acknowledging potentially far-reaching consequences for Shell that may be difficult to undo.
"If Shell are going to hit those 2030 targets that have been imposed on them, they need to start acting now," said Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions at Legal & General Investment Management, the U.K.'s largest asset manager and a Shell shareholder.
"The range of things they could do is big," he said, suggesting options could include selling or spinning off assets.
Mr. Stansbury said that while Shell may be able to successfully appeal the Dutch ruling, the pressure to reduce emissions would remain and that he expected there to be other courts considering the same issue.
The number of climate-change court cases has been climbing, according to a database project jointly run by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and law firm Arnold & Porter, estimating filed cases rose over 10% to 1,824 in the past six months. The majority of these cases are in the U.S.
Oil companies are facing rising scrutiny from activists, governments and investors to take greater action to mitigate their impact on the environment.
Elsewhere Wednesday, an activist investor won at least two seats on Exxon Mobil Corp.'s board, a historic defeat for the oil giant that will likely require it to alter its fossil-fuel-focused strategy.
One way for Shell and other big oil companies to substantially reduce their emissions might be to sell assets, some analysts said.
"Divesting certain projects in the Middle East, Nigeria, Malaysia and few other countries would probably be the easiest way to comply with the court ruling if the company chooses or is forced to do so," Artem Abramov, an analyst at consulting firm Rystad Energy, said of the Dutch court's decision against Shell.
But he noted that asset sales might not benefit the climate. "Even if Shell divests high emission assets, they will just change hands, not be taken off the global energy map."
To meet the court's order, RBC Capital Markets said Shell could have to reduce its oil and natural gas production by around 3% a year, while holding its liquefied-natural gas production flat and cutting oil product sales by around 30% from 2020 levels.
"It could force them to look at exploration where they're spending $1.5 billion per year, and ask whether that number should be lower," said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC.
In its ruling Wednesday, the Dutch court acknowledged that Shell would need to change its policies, which could curb the company's potential growth. Still, it said the interest served by the more stringent emissions reductions outweighed Shell's commercial interests. The court didn't stipulate how the ordered reductions should be met, or how it might monitor or enforce its ruling.
Shell in February set out plans to reduce its oil output by 1%-2% a year, while expanding in lower-carbon energy. At that time it said its carbon emissions likely peaked in 2018, and that it planned to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 20% by 2030 and 100% by 2050.
Earlier this month, around 89% of Shell's shareholders supported the company's transition strategy when it was put to an industry-first vote.
A separate resolution calling for Shell to make more ambitious low-carbon investments and emissions reductions was supported by about 30% of shareholders.
Analysts said it was hard to quantify the risk posed to Shell and other energy companies by the Dutch court ruling and the precedent it potentially sets. Shell's share price closed flat Wednesday and traded down about 1.5% Thursday.

Full text: Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC suffered significant defeats Wednesday as environmental groups and activist investors step up pressure on the oil industry to address concerns about climate change.
In a first-of-its-kind ruling, a Dutch court found that Shell is partially responsible for climate change and ordered the company to sharply reduce its carbon emissions. Hours later in the U.S., an activist investor won at least two seats on Exxon's board, a development that will likely require the oil giant to alter its fossil-fuel focused strategy.
The back-to-back decisions demonstrated how dramatically the landscape is shifting for oil-and-gas companies as they face increasing pressure from environmentalists, investors, lenders, politicians and regulators to transition to cleaner forms of energy.
"The events of today show definitively that many leaders in the oil-and-gas industry have a tin ear and do not understand that society's views and the legal and political environment in which they operate are changing radically," said Amy Myers Jaffe, a professor at Tufts University's Fletcher School who has advised energy companies.
Many oil companies have begun adopting comprehensive plans to reduce emissions, and some, especially in Europe, have diversified into renewable energy. But reducing emissions without sacrificing some returns is proving challenging, and many face skepticism about their strategies.
"It's a real market predicament," said Peter Bryant, a managing partner at business consultant Clareo. "Even if their plan is sound, it doesn't matter right now."
The Shell ruling, issued by the district court in The Hague, found Shell must curb its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels -- and that the company was responsible not only for lowering its own direct emissions from drilling and other operations, but also those of the oil, gas and fuels eventually burned by consumers.
The target is in line with United Nations guidance for member states aimed at preventing global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, which the U.S. rejoined this year, governments agreed to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5 degrees.
"This judgment will not only send shivers down the collective spines of the oil industry, but of all the other industries that significantly contribute to the greenhouse gases," said Martyn Day, a lawyer at Leigh Day, a London-based law firm that has been involved in other pollution cases against Shell.
Shell said that it was disappointed with the ruling and expected to appeal it. The company noted that it is investing billions of dollars in low-carbon energy, including electric-vehicle charging, biofuels and renewables.
"We want to grow demand for these products and scale up our new energy businesses even more quickly," a spokesman said.
Lawyers and consultants said the ruling could set a precedent in Western jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, opening oil companies to new legal jeopardy over carbon emissions. Companies in other heavy-polluting industries could also face greater environmental scrutiny, they said.
"This case does open the door for challenges to other energy-intensive sectors," said Liz Hypes, an analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.
Other industries that could face lawsuits include agriculture, transport and mining, all of which are already being targeted by regulators and civil society over their emissions, Ms. Hypes said.
The civil suit against Shell was led by the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth, an environmental group. It alleged Shell's production of oil and natural gas contributed to climate change, violating a so-called duty of care to those affected by it and failing to meet the company's human-rights obligations. Rather than seek damages, activists asked the court to force Shell to reduce its carbon emissions.
The court said Shell wasn't in breach of its obligation to reduce carbon emissions but that there was an "imminent breach," and it therefore set the reduction requirement. Itdidn't stipulate how the reductions should be achieved, or how it might monitor or enforce its ruling.
Exxon's loss came at the hands of Engine No. 1, an upstart hedge fund owning only about 0.02% of the oil giant's stock. It had waged an aggressive campaign challenging the company's energy transition strategy and response to climate change, depicting it as a corporate dinosaur.
Engine No. 1 called for Exxon to gradually diversify its investments to be ready for a world that will need fewer fossil fuels. Exxon defended its strategy to expand drilling, saying demand for fuels and plastics will remain strong for years, and pointed to a new carbon capture and storage business unit as evidence it is taking climate change seriously.
The Texas-based oil company said that a preliminary vote count showed shareholders backed at least two of Engine No. 1's four nominees, with some votes untallied and the final outcome of several seats on the 12-member board unclear.
Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods personally campaigned against Engine No. 1. Many viewed the vote as a referendum on the CEO's performance.
Exxon lost a record $22 billion last year and was struggling to regain its status as an industry-leading profit engine, even before the coronavirus pandemic crushed global demand for oil and gas.
Both sides feverishly made their case to investors until the last minute. Exxon delayed the closing of the voting by an hour Wednesday morning, and Engine No. 1 said the company was calling investors to ask them to change their votes.
"With almost 3 million shareholders, it's not surprising we heard a wide range of views, and many supported the work that we're doing to improve earnings and cash flow capacity, as well as the work to advance the company to a lower carbon future," Mr. Woods said in a statement.
The hedge fund got a big boost from some of Exxon's largest shareholders.
BlackRock Inc. backed three of Engine No. 1's candidates, and some of the largest U.S. pension funds also supported the activist's slate. Asset managers are under pressure to exert influence on portfolio companies to do more about climate change.
Critics of the world's largest asset manager have said that BlackRock shouldn't veer into areas that should be tackled by policy makers, but the firm's chief executive, Larry Fink, has said "climate risk is investment risk."
BlackRock said it voted for Engine No. 1's candidates in part because it believes Exxon and its board need to further assess the possibility that demand for fossil fuels might decline rapidly in the coming decades.

Full text: For years, Exxon Mobil Corp. didn't have to pay much attention to investors because of its gargantuan profits. Yet on a Friday night in January, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods was defending the company during a video call to an investor owning about 0.02% of the oil giant's stock.
Tech investor Chris James's Engine No. 1 had launched an activist campaign against Exxon in December, calling the company a fossil-fuel dinosaur that lacked a coherent plan for surviving a global transition to cleaner energy sources. On the call, Charlie Penner, a hedge-fund veteran helping lead the Engine No. 1 campaign, pressed Mr. Woods to commit to steering Exxon to carbon neutrality, effectively bringing its emissions to zero -- both from the company and its products -- by 2050.
Mr. Woods refused, arguing that oil companies making such pledges had no real plans to achieve them. "They weren't interested in having a conversation," he said in a recent interview. "Frankly, they didn't have a plan."
Messrs. Woods, James and Penner failed to come to any agreement in what ended in a contentious exchange, people familiar with the matter said.
Since January, Engine No. 1's bid for four seats on Exxon's board has turned into one of the most expensive proxy fights ever. Exxon has spent at least $35 million, and Engine No. 1 has spent $30 million, regulatory filings show, in an increasingly pitched battle to persuade shareholders voting Wednesday at the company's annual meeting.
The activists got a boost Tuesday when BlackRock Inc., one of Exxon's largest shareholders, decided to back three of Engine No. 1's four board nominees, according to people familiar with the matter. Engine No. 1 hasn't called for Mr. Woods's removal, but many view the vote as a referendum on his performance, and the outcome could affect his ability to execute his strategy.
The fight demonstrates the challenge facing Mr. Woods: He is defending Exxon's pumping of oil and gas just as finance is moving decisively toward funding a future based on renewable resources.
"One of the things I've learned in this job and particularly with this activist campaign, is the need and the opportunity for us to do a better job of explaining what we're doing," Mr. Woods said. "We are certainly a large, iconic U.S. company. We are associated with the industry . . . that brings a spotlight."
Less than a decade ago, Exxon was the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, and the idea of an activist campaign challenging its leadership would have been unthinkable.
Former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond sometimes publicly belittled questions by bank analysts on the company's strategy as stupid, once likening some analysts to "Mickey Mouse" and "Goofy."
The underpinning of that attitude has largely crumbled. Exxon last year posted a $22 billion loss when the pandemic crushed fuel demand and upended what turned out to be an ill-timed plan by Mr. Woods to substantially increase spending to boost oil and gas production.
The loss has given momentum to the campaign by Engine No. 1, which has sought to capitalize on investors' fears about years of shrinking profits and concerns about the company's future, as governments increase regulations to address climate change.
So far, the country's three largest pension funds -- the California State Teachers' Retirement System, California Public Employees' Retirement System and the New York State Common Retirement Fund -- have said they would support Engine No. 1's candidates.
A spokeswoman for Engine No. 1 disputed that it was unwilling to have a dialogue with Exxon. The fund has accused Exxon's board of presiding over the company's demise and argued its own candidates have energy experience, unlike many current directors.
"Engine No. 1's plan is to add four directors who have all profitably looked around corners in the energy industry and can help management achieve long-term success in a rapidly changing world," she said.
On Monday, Exxon wrote shareholders pledging to appoint two directors with energy industry and climate experience within the next 12 months, part of a monthslong charm offensive.
Since December, Exxon has spent millions of dollars on advertising and mailed shareholder solicitations. It has appointed three new directors and announced changes long sought by some investors, including creating a business unit for carbon emissions-reducing technologies and disclosing for the first time the emissions from Exxon products.
"At a certain point you have to decide, 'If you're not with me, then you're not with me,'" Mr. Woods said in a 2019 interview at his alma mater, Texas A&M University.
Some investors fear that attitude has made the oil giant slow to react to a changing energy landscape.
In a 2019 meeting of business leaders with Pope Francis at the Vatican, the pontiff implored the CEOs and executives of Exxon, BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BlackRock, State Street Corp. and others to accept moral responsibility to help clean up the planet. Mr. Woods acknowledged the need to address climate change, but he said Exxon had to do so in a way that satisfied its obligation to generate returns for shareholders. His response frustrated his peers at the meeting, which was perceived as tone deaf, people familiar with the matter said.
Stephen Arbogast, a 32-year Exxon executive who is now director of the Energy Center at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said the role of big oil CEO has evolved, and now requires communicating the company's future in a low-carbon world to a broader audience.
"Many of these audiences believe that climate is an existential threat, and that oil and gas need to be sunset industries," Mr. Arbogast said.
Mr. Woods said he didn't seek out the job of Exxon's chief executive. When his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, offered him the position in 2016, Mr. Woods told him he didn't want it.
"Frankly I'm not interested in the limelight," Mr. Woods said, adding that he has learned to deal with it.
Whatever his ambition, current and former colleagues of Mr. Woods say he was marked to climb the ladder at Exxon from early on.
The son of a military supplier, Mr. Woods grew up living at or near U.S. bases around the world. He was an offensive lineman on his Texas high-school football team. He followed his high-school sweetheart, now his wife, to Texas A&M and earned a degree in electrical engineering. He received an M.B.A. at Northwestern University and joined Exxon in 1992.
Mr. Woods eventually agreed to lead the company. The board selected him, in part, because he had climbed the ranks of Exxon's refining division, where profits are made squeezing pennies from every barrel. He also spoke the language of Wall Street, having spent time in Exxon's investor relations division, according to the people. The board wanted a break from Mr. Tillerson, a plain-spoken Texan oilman who had spent billions of dollars in pursuit of high-price oil projects that haven't worked out, these people said.
Current and former Exxon executives describe Mr. Woods as demanding. Before signing off on investment ideas, he subjected employees to marathon review sessions sometimes lasting more than a day. He employed Exxon's practice of randomly assigning executives to blue and red teams, one to tear down an idea, the other to defend it.
Some former Exxon executives said Mr. Tillerson left Mr. Woods a bad hand.
In 2016, Mr. Tillerson's final full year, Exxon's return on capital was 1.3%, down from 26% in 2005, during Mr. Raymond's last year, according S&P Global Market Intelligence. Exxon had nearly $21 billion in its war chest when Mr. Tillerson took over, and had more than $39 billion in net debt when he left.
Some of Mr. Tillerson's biggest bets, including investments in Canadian oil sands and U.S. shale gas, came during a period of high commodity prices, and they failed to generate strong profits when prices fell. Exxon also had to exit some joint ventures with state companies in Russia as a result of Western sanctions. It wrote down U.S. shale gas, Canadian oil sands and other properties by $19 billion this year. Mr. Tillerson didn't respond to requests for comment.
Despite that, Mr. Woods continued Mr. Tillerson's big spending, laying out a plan in 2018 to invest $230 billion to pump an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day by 2025. He sought to differentiate his plan, saying it was a return to Exxon's old playbook: large, disciplined investments on prospects that can make money at low oil prices.
Even before the pandemic, the strategy wasn't yielding immediate results. Production was roughly flat through 2019, Exxon's return on capital that year was just 3% and its net debt ballooned to nearly $50 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
The spread of Covid-19 wrecked Mr. Woods's plans. As countries world-wide imposed quarantines, fossil fuel demand plummeted. Exxon responded by slashing its planned capital spending between 2021 and 2025 by about a third and said it would cut as much as 15% of its global workforce.
Its $22 billion annual loss last year was the first ever. In August, the company was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, after nearly a century on the index.
Exxon's lead director, Merck & Co. Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier, defended Mr. Woods's performance in an interview, saying he had to make difficult decisions to pull the plug on projects and carefully choose among new ones as soon he became CEO.
"Darren, in his tenure, has had the wind in his face," said Mr. Frazier, who will retire as Merck's chief executive in June. "CEOs should be judged, in part, by how they develop and how they execute plans at the bottom of the cycle."
Some of Mr. Woods's biggest investments could turn out to be profitable for Exxon as oil demand recovers and Exxon's peers, including BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, divert money from oil production to renewables. In Guyana, where Exxon made one of the largest oil discoveries in years during Mr. Tillerson's tenure, the company could see a return on investment of 20% or more, analysts said, far surpassing returns from renewable projects.
Still, many investors are growing increasingly disaffected. Exxon's stock has recovered after plummeting during the pandemic, yet still trades at only about 1.5 times its book value, down from about 3.5 times book value shortly after Mr. Raymond left.
Engine No. 1 is banking on that dissatisfaction. It has hammered home Exxon's financial underperformance to investors, while also challenging Exxon's refusal to entertain the idea that fossil fuel demand may decline faster than anticipated.
Mr. Woods has acknowledged the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change, unlike Mr. Raymond, and said Exxon can help reduce emissions while staying committed to oil and gas. In March, he unveiled a strategy that would maintain Exxon as the largest Western oil producer. That has proven a tough sell with some investors.
Large money managers, like BlackRock, are also under pressure to exert influence on their portfolio companies to do more about climate change. BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard collectively own more than 20% of Exxon's shares and could tip the scale on Wednesday's vote. All three have signed a pledge supporting goals to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner. The International Energy Agency said investment in new fossil-fuel projects must stop immediately if the world was going to achieve that.
Legal & General, Britain's biggest asset manager, which owns about $1 billion in Exxon shares, said this month it couldn't support Mr. Woods's strategy and would vote for Engine No. 1's slate. John Hoeppner, who heads its U.S. Sustainable Investments, said his team had met with Exxon representatives several times in recent months and noticed a more conciliatory tone, but that Exxon had not offered substantive proposals to address the firm's concerns.
"It was like, 'We heard you, investment community, we listened and delivered, now let's move on,'" he said. "They don't recognize there is a structural challenge."
Other investors said they had spoken directly to Mr. Woods in recent months and that he had improved investor outreach since becoming chief executive. But, they said, Mr. Woods is unwavering about his views that demand for oil and gas will increase in coming years and unwilling to entertain suggestions that Exxon ought to hedge its bets.
Engine No. 1 has said Exxon's moves since the proxy fight began are inadequate. It has portrayed Exxon's low-carbon unit as an exercise in greenwashing, more about public relations than investment. The fund said Exxon refused to meet with its candidates. Exxon said it reviewed Engine No. 1's candidates and determined they didn't meet the board's standards.
Despite the contention, Engine No. 1 said it wasn't calling for Exxon to unwind its oil and gas business but to gradually diversify itself to be ready for a world that will need less oil and gas. Committing itself to cutting carbon emissions to zero isn't only a benefit to society but a business imperative for Exxon in a changing energy market, it said.
Mr. Woods is adamant that Exxon will be a leader in the energy transition. Exxon was making substantial investments to reduce carbon emissions, he said, while meeting the world's need for oil and gas.
"Whatever the future shapes up to be," Mr. Woods said, "we will be more valuable. That is the objective that we're working for."

Fund for Preparing
For Storms Doubled
President Biden announced Monday that he is doubling U.S. emergency spending to help communities prepare for hurricanes and other extreme weather events, while launching a new effort at NASA to better understand and track the impact of climate change.
The $1 billion in spending is a small fraction of what the U.S. spends on weather-related disasters. Last year alone, the nation endured 22 weather and climate-related disasters with losses greater than $1 billion each. The disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms, had a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion.
FEMA will provide $1 billion for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which helps states, local communities, tribes and territories to develop projects to prepare for and reduce risks from disasters and natural hazards.
Officials pledged to increase investment in climate research to improve understanding of extreme weather events and hone decision making on climate resilience, adaptation and mitigation.

SUPREME COURT
Justices Reject Case
On Police Chokehold
The Supreme Court rejected an appeal from a retired federal law-enforcement officer who was put in a chokehold and wrestled to the ground at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital security checkpoint.
The justices didn't comment Monday in refusing to revive a lawsuit filed by Jose Oliva, 76 years old, against three officers who violently detained him in an altercation captured on camera. Mr. Oliva was 70 at the time of the incident in El Paso, Texas. A Vietnam veteran who spent 25 years in federal law enforcement, Mr. Oliva had an appointment for dental work at the VA facility in 2016. The officers said he failed to produce identification, which Mr. Oliva said he already had put in a bin that was about to be scanned.

WASHINGTON, D.C.
Impeachment Figure
Sues for Legal Fees
Gordon Sondland, the Trump administration's ambassador to the European Union and a pivotal witness in 2019 impeachment proceedings, sued former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday in an effort to recoup $1.8 million he racked up in legal expenses.
Mr. Sondland alleges in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, that Mr. Pompeo had committed to reimburse his legal expenses after he was subpoenaed by House Democrats to testify in an impeachment case that accused President Donald Trump of withholding military aid from Ukraine while demanding an investigation into political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The Senate acquitted Mr. Trump.
Mr. Sondland says Mr. Pompeo "reneged on his promise" after learning the details of Mr. Sondland's testimony.
A spokesperson for Mr. Pompeo called the lawsuit "ludicrous."

Full text: Scientists have been trying to stash carbon emissions in rocks, soil and trees to slow the effects of climate change. Now an economics professor wants to trap carbon dioxide in the financial markets.
Prof. Michael Greenstone's plan takes advantage of the current cap-and-trade system around carbon emissions. It creates a secondary marketplace that allows organizations to offset their carbon emissions with pollution permits. The hope is that this would effectively reduce emissions and redirect capital to environmentally focused startups.
The plan is being driven by the nonprofit Climate Vault that Dr. Greenstone launched with Don Wilson, chief executive of Chicago financial firm DRW Holdings LLC; Bala Srinivasan, senior adviser to the president at the University of Chicago; and Andrew Dailey, managing director of MGI Research LLC. Dr. Greenstone is a professor at the University of Chicago and former White House chief economist during the Obama administration.
The nonprofit launches as investors and companies pour billions of dollars into sustainability-focused financial products, turning the promise of doing good into potential profit centers for Wall Street firms. It is so far unclear if the suddenly booming business of selling environmental investing will continue or if these new products will make an environmental impact.
"We have seen time and time again that markets can be such powerful forces for solving social problems," said Dr. Greenstone.
Currently, several U.S. states and Canadian provinces determine caps for the amount of emissions that certain industrial sectors can emit each year within their regions. These companies need to buy slices of the limited pollution pie in their region through a cap-and-trade market, a type of exchange for pollution allowances.
Under Climate Vault's plan, organizations pay for permits to offset emissions not covered by the market.
Climate Vault promises to "vault" the permits, meaning it won't trade them, theoretically keeping carbon dioxide from being emitted and increasing the value of the remaining permits. The cash that organizations pay for carbon permits would then be used to fund companies that are developing technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere.
To be sure, confidence in Climate Vault's model is dependent on confidence that the carbon markets themselves work as intended in reducing carbon emissions.
A critic of Carbon Vault's model pointed to weaknesses in carbon markets, which he said often have far more permits available than are necessary. This would keep prices low and reduce the incentive for businesses to cut their emissions.
California, for example, has a glut of unused allowances, according to Danny Cullenward, a climate researcher and policy director of CarbonPlan, a nonprofit focused on the scientific integrity of climate projects.
"These emissions budgets are politically determined, which means that large-scale interventions from the private sector don't necessarily influence outcomes," he said.
A spokesman for the California Air Resources Board that runs the state's cap-and-trade program said the organization hasn't seen any evidence of oversupply.
"There are mechanisms to control supply if there are changes in demand (high or low)," he wrote in an email.
So far, Climate Vault has bought about 200,000 metric tons of carbon allowances on behalf of its donors, the emissions equivalent of what 40,000 passenger vehicles produce in a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
This spring, Vanderbilt University donated roughly $1.6 million to Climate Vault to offset the school's carbon footprint for 2021. Climate Vault bought the amount of carbon dioxide permits needed to offset Vanderbilt's expected pollution this year and vaulted them away.
Large Wall Street firms have bought into the plan.
"We were intrigued by the idea of purchasing and retiring credits from the regulated market and eventually using those to potentially fund carbon-capture technologies," said Maryanne Hancock, CEO of Y Analytics, a division of private-equity firm TPG that oversees environmental, sustainability and governance strategy, among other areas.
"It gives you deeper assurance the carbon is actually being averted," she said. TPG was an early donor to Climate Vault.
Climate Vault also plans to work with companies that are using technology or natural processes to remove carbon from the atmosphere. This so-called carbon capture is a potential tool in the effort to reduce carbon emissions enough to limit climate change.
If the carbon-removal companies succeed in removing carbon dioxide, Climate Vault will pay them with the carbon permits it has vaulted away. The companies can then sell those permits on the carbon market for cash.
Former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz serves as the chairman of Climate Vault's effort to fund companies doing carbon capture. Technological approaches such as pulling carbon directly from the air so far haven't worked at scale.
"There's a whole bunch of other directions that really need attention and can be significantly less expensive than direct air capture," said Dr. Moniz.

EXCHANGE --- Wall Street's New Mantra: Green Is Good --- After years of intermittent excitement and fizzled expectations, environmental-oriented investing is no longer just a niche interest; 'We've reached the tipping point and beyond.'

Full text: Some of the world's biggest companies and deepest-pocketed investors are lining up trillions of dollars to finance a shift away from fossil fuels.
Assets in investment funds focused partly on the environment reached almost $2 trillion globally in the first quarter, more than tripling in three years. Investors are putting $3 billion a day into these funds. More than $5 billion worth of bonds and loans designed to fund green initiatives are now issued every day. The two biggest U.S. banks pledged $4 trillion in climate-oriented financing over the next decade.
"We've reached the tipping point and beyond," said James Chapman, chief financial officer at Dominion Energy Inc., one of the country's biggest utilities. Dominion, which has begun issuing green bonds, is planning to spend $26 billion or more on clean energy such as wind and solar in the next five years.
After years of intermittent excitement followed by fizzled expectations, green finance is now looking less like the niche interest of socially conscious investors and more like a sustainable gold rush. Driven by surging valuations for electric-vehicle companies such as Tesla Inc. and startup battery producers, banks and investors are betting the transition from fossil fuels is here to stay, and that they can make money by getting behind it, further entrenching the shift.
Behind the geyser of capital is a confluence of forces. Big money managers see opportunities for substantial profits, and they also worry about financial risks associated with climate change. Many of their clients -- giant pension funds and fast-trading young investors alike -- want to put their wallets behind projects that aim to curb environmental damage.
And many governments around the world are boosting spending on environmental issues and instituting new regulations on the carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. The Biden administration has proposed spending billions of dollars to address climate change. Such moves provide momentum to the investment wagers of the private sector, accelerating the shift.
Even if investors and governments suffer losses, the inflow of cash could produce innovations in areas like batteries that are needed to significantly reduce carbon emissions. "Wall Street will throw money at this problem," said David Brown, principal analyst in the energy-transition practice at consulting and research firm Wood Mackenzie. "Some will lose and some will gain, and the net benefit is you will have new industries that will emerge."
As recently as 2014, the world's energy companies spent $735 billion on oil-and-gas extraction. The figure was less than half that last year, while spending on wind and solar projects rose to nearly $220 billion, up from about $135 billion six years earlier, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Some analysts predict spending on renewable energy will exceed oil and gas in the next several years.
To be sure, few banks or businesses have been willing to give up profitable business lines in the name of climate change. Investors and banks still finance industries that produce lots of carbon, though they often charge more to do it.
And some of the climate-friendly initiatives launched by businesses and investment firms appear designed to do little more than burnish their reputations -- a phenomenon called "greenwashing." Some energy companies, for example, tout efforts to reduce carbon even while producing large amounts of oil and gas and seeking new fossil-fuel sources.
Some green-energy advocates, for their part, say the pace of investments still needs to accelerate substantially and target potential supply-chain bottlenecks such as raw materials used in rechargeable batteries.
The International Energy Agency said recently that global investment in energy projects needs to more than double from its current level to $5 trillion a year by 2030 to meet net-zero emission goals by midcentury. A large portion of the spending needs to be for renewables and other green projects, it said.
Wood Mackenzie has estimated that at least $50 trillion in investment will be needed to reduce fossil-fuel and other greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord. The figure is based on the agreement's targets of the world getting to net-zero emissions in the next 30 years, and limiting the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Wood Mackenzie's models estimated the amount of wind, solar, battery storage and other projects necessary to meet the temperature goal.
Roughly half of that money, the firm said, needs to go to areas such as wind and solar power and battery storage. Another $18 trillion is needed to modernize the electric grid, in part to transition to cleaner energies such as solar and wind.
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that without these investments, costs from weather-related catastrophes and sea-level increases associated with climate change will reach tens of trillions of dollars in the decades ahead.
Total investment in renewable-energy projects, electric vehicles and other green efforts exceeded $520 billion last year, a record, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which tracks green investments. Spending was up 12% from a year earlier and nearly 60% from 2015, Bloomberg data show.
"This is what's really going to drive the momentum for the green shift to happen," said Ajay Kochhar, the chief executive of Li-Cycle, which recycles battery materials and has agreements to work with several battery and auto makers. "It enables scale, which brings down costs, which then enables more proliferation. It's a positive feedback effect that results."
Reaching a deal to secure about $600 million in new financing earlier this year has allowed the Toronto-based company to pursue plans to expand operations in Rochester, N.Y., and around the world.
Financing costs for solar and onshore wind projects during the 2015-20 time period were 20% and 15% lower, respectively, than in the 2010-14 period, according to an Oxford University study.
Fossil-fuel projects, by contrast, have become riskier for investors. Credit-rating firms Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's in recent months warned that industries that produce significant amounts of carbon could be hurt financially as governments, banks and money managers try to lower the carbon intensity of their investments.
Some of the $26 billion that Dominion Energy plans to spend on alternative energy is going toward one of the nation's few major offshore wind facilities, a project off the coast of Virginia Beach, Va. When the project is completed in 2026, it is expected to be the largest offshore wind farm in the U.S., with about 180 turbines, enough to power 660,000 homes.
Virginia passed a clean energy act in 2020, mandating that Dominion be carbon free by 2045. The company, with its steady stream of income from electricity customers, says it was able to finance the project relatively cheaply.
Even in coal-rich West Virginia, a $200 million wind farm is under development. When construction began earlier this year, the governor, coal magnate Jim Justice, said, "This innovation, this diversification for West Virginia, is amazing."
Investment firms are responding to demand from their clients. Since the start of 2019, a net $473 billion has flowed into stock mutual and exchange-traded funds with environmental goals as part of their mandates, while a net $103 billion has gone into all other stock funds, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar Inc. compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Investment firms started 579 new funds with environmental goals last year, the data show.
More than 70% of funds that invest based on environmental, social and corporate-governance practices across all asset classes beat the returns of funds that don't have those objectives in the first four months of the year, according to Morningstar. Electric-car companies and renewable-energy producers have been some of the market's best performing investments in recent years, although they have fallen off in recent weeks. Some investors say green-energy companies could struggle if interest rates rise and make early-stage investments less attractive.
Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, launched a sustainable-investing venture in April in response to client demand. "Every day we hear from a different client who we didn't think would be into" sustainable investing, said Karen Karniol-Tambour, co-chief investment officer of the new venture. "Now they are saying, 'It's part of my mandate.'"
The newest source of cash for clean-energy firms: special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, shell companies that list on an exchange with the purpose of acquiring private firms to take them public. These blank-check companies, as they are known, have agreed to about 35 mergers worth nearly $95 billion with companies tied to green energy, sustainability or electric cars since March 2020, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of figures from data provider SPAC Research.
SPAC mergers have become a popular alternative to initial public offerings for companies tied to areas like green energy, batteries and electric vehicles, in part because they allow private firms to make lofty projections about their future success. Those aren't allowed in a traditional IPO.
Li-Cycle's Mr. Kochhar has spent about half his time fundraising since the company was founded in 2016. Li-Cycle earlier this year reached a deal to go public through a SPAC valuing the firm at about $1.7 billion, which is expected to generate the roughly $600 million in new cash. "Money is not the constraint," he said.
Some investors say many startups going public through SPACs are overvalued and could fail, leaving individual investors with losses even as SPAC insiders are protected through unique incentives. Shares of companies going public through SPACs have fallen lately.
Reed Hundt was the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission during the Clinton administration, when the internet and mobile phones were just starting to take off. He now runs the Coalition for Green Capital, which helps start so-called green banks that fund alternative energy. He sees parallels to the earlier era in the scale and the pace of change that is occurring in the energy industry.
"These are profound economic shifts," he said. The wave of investment, he said, will drive down prices and accelerate the transition from fossil fuels. "The direction set by the market is to go to the cheapest possible fuels -- which are wind and sun," he said.
ReNew Power, one of India's largest renewable-energy companies, is expected to raise $1.2 billion through a U.S. SPAC deal. ReNew has borrowed $1.4 billion since late last year at rates lower than what it paid before. The company plans to more than triple its wind and solar capacity by 2025, said Chief Executive Sumant Sinha.
ReNew expects revenue, which was about $680 million in the year ending in March, to surge as the energy market grows in India, one of the world's largest polluters. Over the next two decades, India is expected to add electricity generation capacity equivalent to what exists today in the European Union, according to the IEA.
Companies and governments issued nearly $315 billion in green and sustainable bonds and other debt securities in the first quarter, more than triple the figure from a year earlier, according to the Institute of International Finance. Investors are willing to pay a premium for such bonds, in comparison to conventional bonds. That "greenium" pushes up bond prices and drives down yields, lowering borrowing costs.
Banks, which for years have been major funders of fossil-fuel companies, see increased financial and reputational risks in those industries. In April, JPMorgan Chase & Co. pledged $2.5 trillion over the next decade for environmental and social causes, including direct funding for wind and solar projects and assistance for clean-energy firms raising money. Bank of America Corp. said it hopes to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion in the sector by 2030.
"Today, banks fight over funding every wind and solar deal," said Jigar Shah, the new head of the federal Energy Department's Loan Programs Office, which oversees more than $40 billion in federal financing for clean energy projects.
Mr. Shah, formerly president of San Francisco sustainable-infrastructure company Generate Capital Inc., said in early May that the Energy Department's loan office has had more than 130 formal consultations with businesses -- the final step before an applicant files for a loan -- since he took the job in March. He says he expects to have about 10 deals approved by August.
The loan office was criticized a decade ago after the failure of Solyndra, a California solar company it had backed, Mr. Shah points to successes, such as Tesla, which received a $465 million loan in 2010 that helped it accelerate production of the Model S and build a factory in California.
At the time, Tesla was a risky startup. Now, it is the most valuable auto maker in the world, with a market value of about $560 billion. The company repaid the loan ahead of schedule in 2013.
Tesla's soaring stock helped ignite an investing frenzy around electric cars and batteries, and it has boosted the performance of many sustainable-investment funds, attracting more cash to the sector. Mr. Shah said the government can play an important role by backing early-stage companies, which draws in other investors.
Critics of such public-private investment plans say they can drive away private-sector capital because the government typically has the most senior loan, making it first to get repaid in the event of default. Another common criticism, that the government doesn't have the expertise to assess risky startups, is one reason the loan-office job went to Mr. Shah, who spent much of his career making such assessments.
The Biden administration's proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan would expand subsidies through tax credits. Another administration proposal, the Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator Act, would provide $100 billion in funding for projects in renewable power, grid infrastructure and reforestation.
Alphabet Inc.'s Google committed to getting power from clean-energy sources around the clock by 2030. By signing upfront agreements with utilities to purchase clean energy, Google is helping them get better financing terms for their projects, said Michael Terrell, Google's head of energy.
Microsoft Corp. last year said it planned to offset all its carbon emissions since Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded it in 1975. Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company realized several years ago that the business case for investing in renewables had become stronger.
"This is where the world is going," he said. "It's where regulators are going. It's where customers and investors are going."

Full text: SAO PAULO -- Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, who is charged with helping protect the Amazon, was targeted by Brazilian federal police Wednesday as part of an investigation into alleged illegal chopping of trees for export, according to people familiar with the probe
Police said about 160 officers were deployed to carry out 35 search warrants in Brasilia, Sao Paulo, and the Amazonian state of Para related to alleged crimes involving corruption and smuggling. Police raided properties linked to Mr. Salles, according to people familiar with the operation, who didn't give any more details.
Mr. Salles said in a video sent by aides that the accusations against him are unfounded, and added that he and the other workers under investigation would have cooperated with authorities if given the chance.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro last month asked the U.S. to pay Brazil $1 billion to help the South American country reduce deforestation, saying the way to save the rainforest is by financing sustainable activity in the region. Brazilian officials say that industrialized countries need to take responsibility for their past contributions to climate change.
Mr. Salles has been at the center of Brazil's efforts to win compensation for his country's past and current work to reduce deforestation, and the investigation could raise concerns in the Biden administration and among U.S. lawmakers about Brazil's commitment to protecting the environment.
There has been sharp international criticism over the protection of the Amazon under Mr. Bolsonaro's administration. About 224 square miles of trees in the Amazon were lost in April, the highest level for that month since Brazil's space research agency, Inpe, created the Terra Brasilis platform in 2015 to track the data.
Eduardo Bim, the head of Brazil's environmental agency Ibama, was removed from his role as part of the operation, which was authorized by the country's supreme court, according to a person close to the probe. Ibama, which oversees environmental regulation and protection of Brazil's rainforests, didn't respond to requests for comment.
The White House and State Department didn't respond to a request for comment.
Brazil's Supreme Court authorized the searches after receiving information about a "serious scheme to facilitate the smuggling of forest products" that allegedly involved Mr. Salles, Mr. Bim and 10 other government workers, according to documents.
The documents said Para state's environmental agency had informed U.S. authorities about at least seven shipments containing wood that lacked the proper documentation and authorization from the state.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court handed the city of Baltimore a preliminary setback in its bid to sue more than 20 multinational oil-and-gas companies on allegations they contributed to climate change and misled the public.
Baltimore filed the 2018 lawsuit in Maryland state court, alleging energy companies failed to warn the public about the dangers of their products. The city says it has suffered climate-change-related injuries, including from rising sea levels and extreme weather, and seeks to recover monetary damages. Other state and local governments have filed similar lawsuits.
The defendants fighting such claims include BP PLC, Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC.
They sought to move Baltimore's case to federal court, which they argued is a more appropriate venue with fairer procedural protections. The companies said the case belonged in the federal system because some of their oil-and-gas exploration efforts have come at the behest of the federal government.
A federal trial judge denied the request in 2019 and last year a federal appeals court said it was largely powerless to consider moving the case out of the state system.
The high court, in a 7-1 opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch, on Monday said that decision was incorrect.
In a highly technical ruling, the Supreme Court sent the case back to a federal appeals court for further proceedings. The justices said nothing about the substance of the case.
Only Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented. Justice Samuel Alito didn't participate in the case.

Full text: Central banks, the most powerful financial institutions in the world, want to become the guardians of the environment as well.
The central banks say climate change is a financial and economic risk. They believe rising sea levels, more wildfires and bigger storms could cause shortages that spur inflation, the regulators' traditional nemesis.
The banks that are deepest into the issue are trying to limit climate change by steering their financial systems away from fossil fuels. Their regulations could hit U.S. companies operating overseas. The Bank of England's remit now explicitly includes environmental sustainability as well as maintaining price stability.
The Federal Reserve is proceeding cautiously, worried about financial risks but wary of expanding its mandate, which would put it in the middle of the partisan debate over climate change.
In December, the Fed joined the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System. That group, which includes central banks and regulators of major European countries as well as China, Russia and Japan, started with eight members in 2017.
Now, with 90 central banks and regulators as members, the group is planning to meet at a major conference in June. Some members are adjusting policy based on climate considerations, potentially including higher capital charges for lending to fossil-fuel companies and bank stress tests that focus on the risk of rising temperatures to loan portfolios.
The group, which was launched in part as a response to the U.S. announcing in 2017 that it was pulling out of the Paris climate accords, includes regulators of all the world's globally systemic banks. The central banks' rising interest in climate dovetails with a flood of investor cash into products such as green bonds and into stocks of companies that make batteries and produce alternative energy. The U.S. has since rejoined the Paris accords.
Potential risks posed to the financial system by climate change include losses on loans or a decline in the value of assets, such as waterfront property and property repeatedly exposed to wildfires. Commercial banks and investors lend billions to companies that produce significant amounts of carbon dioxide, such as operators of coal power plants.
While climate change could affect macro economies, the effort right now is largely focused on regulating financial companies. Still, it takes the central banks beyond their traditional focus of managing inflation.
In March, the group proposed options to adapt monetary policy "to a hotter world" including central banks' charging higher interest rates to lenders that pledge carbon-intensive assets as collateral.
Some central banks are also debating whether to require banks to set aside more capital for loans to fossil-fuel companies and less capital on loans to wind- or solar-power companies. Such a move would mean central banks would be influencing which parts of the economy get credit. Shifting in that direction would go against the long-held belief by central banks that they should avoid influencing lending decisions and could embroil them in political disputes over the extent of climate change.
Some central banks are moving more quickly than others, setting rules that U.S. companies will have to follow in affected countries and creating possible examples for the Fed and others.
In the U.K., Treasury chief Rishi Sunak this year changed the remit of the Bank of England's interest-rate-setting committee to include "strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is also environmentally sustainable" as well as maintaining price stability.
The Bank of France has started tallying the potential costs of climate change. A pilot climate stress test of banks and insurers found that the cost of insurance claims could rise as much as six times in parts of France by 2050 because of the increasing risk of droughts and flooding.
The European Central Bank, which oversees monetary policy and bank regulation in the eurozone, says climate already is covered by its mandate.
"Climate change can directly affect inflation. This may happen when more frequent floods or droughts destroy crops and raise food prices, for example," wrote Frank Elderson, a member of the ECB's executive board and the chairman of the central banks' climate group. "These issues clearly lie at the heart of our mandate."

Full text: Professional money managers are turning up the heat on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
California Public Employees' Retirement System and Neuberger Berman have demanded that the Omaha, Neb., conglomerate bring in new directors and provide more disclosures on climate risks and executive pay.
Leading up to Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday, proxy advisers Glass Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. have recommended that investors withhold their votes for board members.
While many of the complaints aren't new and none of the shareholder proposals are likely to pass, Berkshire's lackluster returns in recent years have made it more vulnerable to criticism amid a growing wave of investor interest in corporate sustainability issues.
The shareholder movement to press companies on climate change, social progress and governance continues to gain steam in the U.S., emerging as a key selling point for money managers in their efforts to keep client money.
Under Mr. Buffett's leadership, the firm boasts 20% compounded annualized gains from 1965 to 2020, outperforming the S&P 500's 10.2% gains including dividends during the period. Berkshire's total returns over the past three- and five-year periods were 12% and 14%, respectively, compared with the index's 19% and 18%.
"Berkshire has gotten a pass in part because of its historically strong financial performance," said Simiso Nzima, head of corporate governance at Calpers.
Berkshire has stressed its continued focus on the long game. Mr. Buffett, who is chief executive and chairman, built up a diverse portfolio of mostly U.S. businesses and investments meant to perform over decades, not to compete with a volatile market buoyed by booming tech stocks.
Calpers, the nation's largest public-pension fund, with $444 billion in assets, co-sponsored a shareholder proposal asking Berkshire to provide more disclosures on climate-related risks and opportunities.
The pension fund is also withholding its votes to re-elect members of the board's audit and governance committees on grounds of failing to meet shareholder demands over climate-risk disclosures. It said it was concerned that the board lacks new members, doesn't engage with shareholders and isn't letting investors vote on executive pay plans.
"If you don't refresh the board, you don't have a next generation of directors able to learn from the long-serving directors before they leave the board," Mr. Nzima said.
Berkshire declined to comment ahead of the company's Saturday meeting.
Neuberger, a money manager with more than $429 billion in assets, also said it would vote for several shareholder-led proposals related to environmental, social and corporate-governance issues, often abbreviated as ESG.
"One would think that if companies have a responsibility to look out for the environment or deliver good on social issues and governance, that Berkshire might be a leader in these areas," said Michelle Giordano, a Neuberger analyst who follows the company. "But it doesn't seem like they are."
Berkshire said in its annual proxy statement that while it agreed companies had a responsibility to manageclimate risks, it preferred to let its various operating units commit to their own environmental policies. Mandates from a small corporate office, the company wrote, would infringe upon the autonomy that has helped those businesses thrive under Berkshire's ownership. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, for instance, already produces a sustainability report.
Calpers also has pledged to support a proposal requiring the company to report its efforts to diversify its staff.
Berkshire said the diversity-report proposal improperly suggests that "there is a standardized technique for each of Berkshire's more than 60 operating businesses to address diversity, equity and inclusion."
"It would be unreasonable to ask for uniform, quantitative reporting for the purposes of comparing such dissimilar operations in different geographic locations," Berkshire wrote.
Glass Lewis and ISS recommended shareholders vote for the ESG proposals and withhold votes for certain directors.
Another factor is at play: Berkshire shares are slowly changing hands.
Mr. Buffett's longstanding plan to shrink his stake in the company over time has shifted more Berkshire shares to big institutional investors, said Lawrence Cunningham, a law professor at George Washington University who has written extensively about the company.
About 70% of Berkshire's shares are owned by individuals, many of whom are longtime holders loyal to Mr. Buffett, Mr. Cunningham said. And many don't care whether Berkshire lacks a corporate sustainability report or an investor-relations team at the ready to answer their questions.
"Berkshire's unusual and valued family of individual shareholders may add to your understanding of our reluctance to court Wall Street analysts and institutional investors," Mr. Buffett wrote in his most recent letter to shareholders. "We already have the investors we want and don't think that they, on balance, would be upgraded by replacements."
The gradual uptick in institutional ownership, though, might already be empowering professional managers to press Berkshire on governance matters. When Mr. Buffett and his estate sell off his remaining shares, it is likely those money managers will hold an even bigger stake in the company, Mr. Cunningham said.
"There will be a dawning of significant leadership and structural change, and these holders are preparing for that battle," Mr. Cunningham said.

Full text: Franklin D. Roosevelt created the modern government-funded social safety net in the 1930s to aid lower- and middle-income families -- paid for in part by jacking up taxes on the richest Americans. Dwight Eisenhower built the interstate highway system in the 1950s. John F. Kennedy defined federal industrial policy in the 1960s by pledging to put a man on the moon by decade's end.
In his first 100 days in office, Joe Biden has been attempting to emulate all three, seeking to combine and update for the 21st century his predecessors' visions for a muscular Washington role in the economy.
With his American Families Plan unveiled Wednesday -- following his American Jobs Plan and his American Rescue Plan -- President Biden has proposed $6 trillion in new federal spending for the next decade. That is far more than any recent president at a comparable point in their terms.
Beyond expanding the size and scope of government, Mr. Biden's program aims to redistribute trillions of dollars of resources from the highest-earning households and businesses to everyone making less than $400,000 a year.
He suggests doing so by undoing a portion of former President Donald Trump's tax cuts for corporations and high-income families. But Mr. Biden also wants to go further, giving the Internal Revenue Service more resources to scrutinize alleged tax avoidance, adding higher and different types of capital-gains taxes for certain investors, and raising taxes on a popular form of Wall Street compensation.
All told, the top tax rates on the top earners would hit their highest rate, according to analysts, since before Ronald Reagan ushered in a new era favoring tax cuts in the early 1980s.
In Mr. Biden's agenda, some core themes have emerged. His administration wants to:
Expand the reach of the government social safety net well beyond retirement security, healthcare and income support, pushing more deeply into attempting to offer a federal guarantee for child-care, preschool, and college.
Extend the federal role in building infrastructure and redefine what it means beyond the traditional understanding of roads and bridges to high-speed internet service and caregiving, freeing up workers who would otherwise have to stay home to tend to children, or elderly parents.
Give Washington a new role in developing critical industries from semiconductors to electric cars, to compete with foreign rivals and to attack climate emissions.
In unveiling last week Mr. Biden's plans to slash carbon emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2030, his aides acknowledged that the technologies to do so might not yet exist, but that the government could bring those capabilities about.
And while the spotlight has so far been on Mr. Biden's plans to expand government through increased spending, his aides have also been working to extend the power and remit of regulation to advance a long list of goals, from curbing emissions to giving workers more bargaining power.
The vision that Mr. Biden is explicitly rejecting is the one laid out by Mr. Reagan in the 1980s, and has in some form defined economic policy making for the following four decades. Under that vision, lower taxes combined with deregulation was generally the best formula for faster growth and broadly shared prosperity.
Mr. Biden and his aides argue that more direct government support is a better way to support most Americans, and they see a clear trade-off between policies they say favor affluent winners over lower-income households. That is the theory behind their view that the tax code over the past few decades has tilted too much in favor of investors.
"Trickle-down economics has never worked," Mr. Biden said in his speech to Congress on Wednesday. "We're going to reward work, not just wealth," was how Mr. Biden framed his tax plan.
Many Republicans argue that Mr. Biden's attempts to support lower- and middle-income households over investors will end up harming both. The pre-pandemic economy "was the best our country has seen in decades," Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said after Mr. Biden's speech, a boom he attributed to the Trump tax cuts. "The quickest way to slow our post-pandemic economic recovery is to hike taxes," Mr. Grassley added.
A driving principle behind the Biden $6 trillion plan is that "we have to rebuild trust in government to solve big problems," says Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council. Or as Cecilia Rouse, head of the Council of Economic Advisers puts it: "government shouldn't be a dirty word."
The American public's trust in government eroded over the past few decades in part as backlash to the big-spending programs of the 1960s. The Biden economic program is rooted in a belief that the American economy is now riddled with market failures that only Washington can fix.
Two areas in particular illustrate the Biden focus: caregiving and climate.
The federal government has never played a major role in caregiving, even as the sector has become more central to the economy.
Both Mr. Biden's jobs plan and his families plan propose hundreds of billions of dollars of new federal support for caregiving. That includes $400 billion in funding for home care for the elderly, and direct subsidies to lower- and middle-income families.
As administration officials sell those plans, they are attempting to portray them as a form of infrastructure that can boost productivity and growth.
Scientific warnings about the threat of climate change have also, in the telling of Biden officials, upended traditional assumptions about the government's role.
"The need for public investment could not be clearer, perhaps in ways that weren't clear 12 years ago when President Obama took office," says Ben Harris, a Treasury Department economist. "Climate change is an example of a massive problem that requires government intervention."

Full text: Countries aiming to sharply reduce their emissions to meet climate goals must be prepared for staggering costs and looming political battles as they seek to overhaul swaths of their economies, climate analysts and economists say.
The International Renewable Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organization based in Abu Dhabi, saidin March the world would need to invest $115 trillion through 2050 in clean technologies, such as solar power and electric vehicles, to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Such goals, made at the 2015 Paris accords,were revived in the Earth Day Climate Summit hosted last week by President Biden.
Environmentalists and some economists say the changes would translate into innovative technologies and job creation, while saving a million lives annually from lowering air pollution and circumventing higher water levels that would swamp coastal cities. Still, the upfront costs would require revamps across many sectors, including steel production, agriculture and cargo shipping.
Mr. Biden's target of sharply reducing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 would force companies to speed the pace of change and present new expenses. Much of the world's hopes for reducing carbon emissions, however, rest on China and India, which are heavily dependent on coal -- considered the dirtiest fossil fuel -- to generate power. China is the No. 1 emitter globally.
David Victor, an international-relations professor at the University of California San Diego who focuses on climate policies, said getting to zero requires "eliminating essentially all fossil fuels."
"What do you do about cement? What do you do about steel production? What do you do about agriculture? What do you do about aviation and shipping?" he said. "There's a tendency when you study radical technological change to overestimate what's possible in the near term."
China must invest $21 trillion over three decades to overhaul transportation, industry and construction while building nuclear, wind and solar production facilities to reach thegoal of zero net emissions by 2060, according to a report presented by China's leading climate experts in October at Tsinghua University. That amounts to more than 2.5% of its annual gross domestic product.
Weaning China off coal won't be simple. Coal supplied 56.8% of its energy consumption in 2020, according to official data, with 1,082 plants generating nearly 1,100 gigawatts of power.
With its vibrant economy barely slowing during the pandemic, China is expected to consume 6% more coal by 2025 compared with 2020, the China National Coal Association reported last month. In 2020, China proposed 73.5 gigawatts of new coal plants, more than five times the rest of the world combined.
President Xi Jinping, addressing the summit, said the country would reduce coal consumption in five years. He didn't offer to end burning of coal nor did he accelerate the timetable for China to lower carbon emissions, as environmentalists had hoped.
Still, after adopting recommendations made in the Tsinghua University report, Mr. Xi in December announced at a United Nations summit plans to lower carbon intensity by more than 65% from its level in 2005.
He also said China would increase the share of nonfossil fuels in its mix to about 25% by 2030, up from 15.3% in 2020. The president pledged in December to bring the total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1,200 gigawatts by 2030, more than double the present capacity.
Some note that much of China's dependence on fossil fuels has to do with the economic stimulus that comes with the construction of coal plants in certain regions; China's coal plants run at 49% capacity. Many on the drawing board might never be built because they aren't economically viable, energy researchers say.
But China has balked at having to keep up with developed countries in lowering emissions. "Developed countries need to increase climate ambition and action and make concrete efforts to help developing countries accelerate the transition to green and low-carbon development," Mr. Xi said.
The administration has set a U.S. goal for cutting emissions by as much as 52% by 2030 from 2005 and an end to greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. Mr. Biden plans to double financing for low-income countries for climate-reduction plans while prodding private business to develop green-friendly initiatives.
The goals laid out in the Paris agreement aren't legally binding. But they rely largely on the international consensus that ecosystems could be devastated unless the rise in global temperature is limited to about 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
Another fast-growing developing country, India, also provides a challenge when it comes to reducing dependence on coal.
Coal supplies nearly half its energy, and new coal plants that would produce 100 gigawatts have been approved. India is second in the world in coal consumption, with its global share expected to rise from 11% to 14% in 2030.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated at the climate summit India's goal is to build 450 gigawatts of renewable-energy sources by 2030, including solar, wind and small hydroelectric plants. If it happens, that would make up about 55% of the 817 gigawatts India's Central Electricity Authority estimates the country will need in 2030. The country, though, remains far from that target, with 94 gigawatts of renewable power installed.
Obstacles include the economic and geopolitical: Big solar developers generally contract with state power-distribution companies to sell them the electricity at a set price for a term that can be as long as 25 years.
But solar prices have fallen so quickly that some financially strapped distribution companies have balked at paying the higher prices they previously agreed to.
Policy makers are also increasingly uncomfortable at buying so much of their solar equipment from their rival, China, which controls the bulk of solar manufacturing.
Addressing the concerns from countries about overhauling their economies, White House climate czar John Kerry emphasized the potential advantages of moving toward greener energy and transportation sources. "No one is being asked for a sacrifice," he said on Friday. "This is an opportunity."
The International Renewable Energy Agency says the shift should create three times more jobs than it destroys, because renewable energy industries tend to be more labor intensive than fossil fuels. The International Labour Organization in 2018 said the transition will destroy 6 million jobs but create 24 million new ones worldwide. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the shift is likely to resemble previous transitions when industrialized societies embraced new technologies, like the internet.

Full text: Meeting President Biden's goal of sharply reducing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 would require dramatically reshaping key sectors of the economy, from energy to transportation to agriculture.
While U.S. industries are already transitioning to a lower-carbon future, Mr. Biden's target would prod industries to greatly speed the pace of change. Some appear to be ready. Others would face extraordinary challenges.
All would face significant new costs -- exactly how much is unknown -- and it is unclear how much would be subsidized by government tax policies or incentives, since the Biden administration has yet to detail how it would seek to reach its aggressive new goal.
Sectors that appear most directly affected by Mr. Biden's emissions pledge -- including agriculture, transportation, oil and gas extraction, utilities, and chemical and plastics manufacturing -- collectively make up more than 10% of the nation's $21 trillion gross domestic product, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data. The costs of the related energy and raw materials they produce affect nearly every corner of the economy. Transportation generates 29% of U.S. emissions, followed by electricity generation at 25% and industry at 23%, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's annual inventory of greenhouse-gas emissions. "This is a real sea change in the degree of ambition by the U.S. government; it is pretty monumental," said Richard Newell, president and chief executive of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan think tank. "This is technically feasible but a substantial acceleration of existing trends."
At an Earth Day climate summit this week, Mr. Biden called for slashing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 50% to 52% compared with the baseline year of 2005, as he seeks to put America at the forefront of world-wide efforts to combat climate change.
Mr. Biden's target is a significant ratcheting up of the goal articulated by former President Barack Obama -- a 26% to 28% cut by 2025 -- to help put the U.S. on a path to comply with the Paris agreement, which seeks to limit average global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
His actions have received support from numerous big businesses, many of which have pledged recently to cut their own emissions. In an open letter to Mr. Biden, dozens of companies including McDonald's Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google said a more ambitious climate target would "guide the U.S. government's approach to more sustainable and resilient infrastructure, zero-emissions vehicles and buildings, improved agricultural practices, and durable carbon removal."
But they have also raised concerns among representatives for some of the large industries that would be most heavily affected, who have called them unrealistic.
Academics, business consultants and others who study U.S. emissions say that meeting Mr. Biden's targets would require significant changes in two key areas: how the U.S. generates electricity and how it powers its cars and trucks.
The transportation and warehouse sector, which makes up roughly 2.8% of the economy, is also getting cleaner, thanks largely to tightening fuel-economy standards and a growing push by major auto makers to invest in electric vehicles. But it too would need to speed up changes to meet Mr. Biden's target.
According to a new Boston Consulting Group report, the U.S. is on a path to reduce light-vehicle emissions by 50% in 2035. To move that up five years will require ongoing incentives to purchase electric vehicles, but also the return of a cash-for-clunkers type program, the report concluded.
Top U.S. auto makers have already committed to raising EV output. Ford for instance said earlier this year that it was committing $22 billion to electric vehicles and the digital technology involved in connecting them to the internet by 2025.
"Ford supports lowering U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions 50% by 2030," said spokesman T. R. Reid. But putting more electric vehicles on the road will require a dependable supply of batteries and semiconductors, he added. "We're involved in real-time discussions with the administration about long-term availability of those key components."
Other challenges remain. The U.S. would need a huge expansion of electric-vehicle charging stations before such cars could reach a mass market.
In the power sector utilities sector, which makes up roughly 1.6% of GDP, renewable energy is already on the rise, fueled in part by falling costs for wind and solar farms, but also subsidies and state-level mandates.
In 2020, 39.5% of U.S. electricity came from zero-carbon emitting sources such as nuclear, wind and solar, up from 29.9% a decade earlier, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.
One of the most affected industries would be the American oil and gas sector, which raised its output substantially over the past decade, thanks to fracking, boosting the economies of states such as Texas and North Dakota. Oil and gas extraction directly makes up roughly 0.6% of GDP, while chemicals and plastics, largely made from fossil fuels, account for 1.9% and 0.4%, respectively.
Agriculture, which makes up nearly 1% of the economy, contributes about 10% of annual U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, according to the EPA, and relative to other industries has faced fewer government mandates to reduce its carbon footprint.
Big meat and grain-processing companies have set voluntary targets in response to consumer and investor pressure, but many farmers remain resistant to regulations centered on farms and feedlots.
JBS SA, the world's largest meat company, believes its voluntary efforts to curb emissions across its U.S. beef and pork operations are aligned with the Biden administration's target, according to Cameron Bruett, the company's U.S. chief sustainability officer.
The most difficult major category to reduce emissions may be heavy industry. Steel, cement and petrochemical manufacturing require large amounts of energy and emit substantial emissions.
Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, says reducing industrial emissions will be costly.
"This is the place where we might actually think about doing some really expensive things," she said.

Full text: China and India, both with huge and growing appetites for energy, will play outsize roles in efforts to curb greenhouse-gas emissions as the world seeks to come up with more ambitious targets on climate change.
The two countries are similar in many ways. They have massive populations topping 1.3 billion, and both are heavy users of coal, the worst fossil fuel in terms of carbon emissions. China alone consumed more than half of the world's coal in 2019, according to the International Energy Agency. India is currently a distant No. 2 with 11% of the global share, but its share is expected to rise to around 14% by 2030.
Both countries' leaders, who have signaled they don't want to be seen as acting at the behest of the U.S., argued at the virtual two-day climate summit hosted by the White House, which began Thursday, that their nations should shoulder different responsibilities than developed nations in the fight against climate change.
But there are also significant differences in their approaches. While India defines itself as a developing country with a longer timeline for reducing emissions and as a potential recipient of money and technology to help, China increasingly wants to position itself as a climate leader and a provider of technological and financial support.
"China and India are among the world's biggest emitters, so without them it will be impossible to achieve the Paris Agreement," said Byford Tsang, a London-based senior policy adviser at E3G, a think tank that advocates for strategies to reduce carbon emissions.
In China's case, he said, the question isn't whether the country can reach its own goals but whether it can do what is needed to keep the temperature rise at 1.5 degree Celsius, a goal set by the Paris Climate Agreement.
China will reduce coal consumption starting in 2026, Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the summit. He also reiterated his pledge from September that China would reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality -- net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions -- by 2060.
But he stopped short of promising a carbon-emissions cap, as some climate campaigners had hoped. Mr. Xi "obviously did not want to make any big announcement under U.S. pressure," said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a new partnership with the U.S. to expand renewable energy. He didn't add another climate goal or upgrade India's existing ones. "We in India are doing our part," Mr. Modi said.
Climate negotiators are seeking to set more aggressive climate targets to reach the goals agreed to in the Paris Agreement by building momentum ahead of a United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.
Developing countries want richer countries to make good on pledges from the Paris climate negotiations to mobilize $100 billion a year in public and private financing to aid the effort. Top Indian officials made financial support among their top requests to John Kerry, the Biden administration's climate envoy, when he visited this month.
India has reduced its carbon intensity -- or how much carbon dioxide is emitted per unit of gross domestic product -- by 26% versus 2005 levels, India's environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, said at an April speech sponsored by the French Embassy in India. "We all have to act," he said. "But those who have polluted have to act more."
Under its current policies, India's carbon emissions will rise 50% by 2040, the IEA forecasts. That is more than any other country for which the IEA did projections, and is enough to cancel out the forecast fall in emissions from all of Europe.
In 2019, China had 9.8 billion tons of carbon emissions. The country's climate scientists expect emissions to plateau at 10.5 billion tons, based on China's current policies.
Mr. Xi also said that China would "strictly control coal-fired power generation projects" as well as "strictly limit the increase in coal consumption" through 2025 before starting to reduce it over the following five years.
This leaves room for China to further increase coal consumption in the next four years. China proposed 73.5 gigawatts of new coal-fired power last year, more than five times as much as the rest of the world combined. In 2020, coal supplied nearly 57% of China's energy, according to China's statistics bureau.
But the picture may not be as bad as it seems on the surface. A number of the coal-fired power plants that China has approved may never get built because they aren't economically viable or likely desired by Beijing, said Zhang Xiliang, the director of the Institute of Energy, Environment, and Economy at Tsinghua University.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden sought to assert U.S. leadership in global climate talks, committing to a sharp reduction in the nation's greenhouse-gas emissions at a summit Thursday that drew promises from other world leaders to take action and calls for rich nations to shoulder more responsibility.
"No nation can solve this crisis on our own," Mr. Biden said at the start of the two-day virtual climate summit at the White House. "All of us, and particularly those of us that represent the world's largest economies, we have to step up."
The climate summit is aimed at jump-starting global efforts to reduce emissions as part of the Paris agreement, which calls on countries to ratchet up their climate commitments every five years. The deal relies largely on international pressure, rather than legally binding enforcement mechanisms, to persuade countries to make deep emissions cuts.
China, the No. 1 emitter and the world's No. 2 economy, said it would reduce but not eliminate coal consumption, and it called on wealthy countries like the U.S. to do more. Several other countries pledged to cut future emissions and expand their use of renewable energy.
Scientists and activists have said that without major action this decade from the U.S., China, the European Union, India and other top emitters, countries won't be able to meet the Paris agreement's goal of keeping average global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Temperature increases above that threshold could be devastating for some ecosystems and could result in rising seas that flood major cities, among other risks, according to the United Nations.
Mr. Biden used the summit to unveil a new target that calls for cutting U.S. emissions 50% to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030. The year 2005 is a common baseline for such climate targets.
In 2019, the most recent year for which complete data are available, U.S. emissions were about 13% below 2005 levels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Emissions last year were projected to be down 21% from that 2005 baseline, due in part to a slowdown related to the pandemic. But this year, emissions are tracking higher again as the economy recovers.
"The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable and the cost of inaction keeps mounting," Mr. Biden, a Democrat, said at the summit, which featured 40 world leaders, with allies and rivals such as Russia and China among them.
Major companies, including Apple Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Walmart Inc., have endorsed the president's 50% target. Critics among congressional Republicans and the energy industry said Mr. Biden's plan could hurt the economy by raising the price of energy.
"What they put out today addresses the risks of climate change, but it doesn't address the key challenge of affordable and reliable energy," said Mike Sommers, leader of the American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. trade group for oil-and-gas companies.
President Xi Jinping of China said at the summit that his country would reduce coal consumption starting in 2026. Mr. Xi's promise offered a peak but not an end to China's coal consumption and didn't meet the expectations of climate campaigners who were hoping for a more ambitious emissions-reduction timetable.
Instead, Mr. Xi reiterated the timetable he had already set forth for China reaching peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality -- net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions -- by 2060.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India made public a new partnership with the U.S. to expand renewable energy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said his country would aim for a reduction in carbon output below 2005 levels of between 40% to 45% by the end of the decade. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. was putting into legislation its intention to cut emissions by 78% from 1990 levels by 2035. That goal, made public earlier in the week, is a step up from a previous target of a 68% emissions cut by 2030.
The EU approved this week a trillion-dollar plan aimed at making the 27-country bloc climate-neutral by 2050 and improving its overall ecological performance.
China, the world's No. 1 emitter, and many developing nations said they shouldn't shoulder the same responsibilities as developed countries to combat climate change, arguing that wealthy nations were allowed to release greenhouse-gas emissions into the atmosphere unchecked for decades while they industrialized.
"Developed countries need to increase climate ambition and action and make concrete efforts to help developing countries accelerate the transition to green and low-carbon development," Mr. Xi said.
Marshall Islands President David Kabua, whose country is threatened by sea-level rise, also pressed for help from wealthy nations. "Too often, vulnerable countries hear the excuse that state emission cuts are too costly, but political signals, especially from the major economies, shape decisions on investment and innovation for low-carbon pathways," he said.
Many nations' leaders are skeptical of U.S. promises on climate following decades of sharp policy shifts, including President George W. Bush abandoning the 1997 Kyoto Protocol negotiated under the Bill Clinton administration and President Donald Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate deal that President Barack Obama played a central role in negotiating in 2015.
Developing nations are also pursuing billions of dollars in financial assistance to help them lower their emissions, adapt to the effects of climate change and offset the costs of limiting their reliance on fossil fuels. Mr. Biden said the U.S. would double by 2024 the annual climate-related financing it provides to developing countries.
Under a plan released by the White House, federal agencies will move toward ending U.S. government investment in foreign carbon-intensive, fossil fuel-based energy projects. And the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., an agency that helps finance projects in developing nations, will transition to a portfolio that is net-zero in emissions by 2040. The president added that the U.S. continues to support an effort to send $100 billion from rich countries to developing nations.
Mr. Biden's new emissions goal would nearly double the target set by Mr. Obama, which called for a 26% to 28% cut by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Biden administration said this week that the U.S. is on track to meet that target.
Global progress has been slow since the Paris accords went into effect. Several of its biggest advocates found it difficult to fulfill their ambitions, and within a year, China's emissions began accelerating again after a brief slowdown.
U.S. officials said they see multiple paths toward achieving their goals, through a combination of federal policies and action by states, companies and other subnational groups. Mr. Biden has proposed a $2.3 trillion infrastructure package that includes measures to reduce emissions, such as a proposed standard mandating that U.S. electricity be produced with low-carbon energy sources.
The 24-page climate plan the U.S. submitted to the U.N. on Thursday includes broad top-line options for reaching the target. A federal climate task force set up by Mr. Biden will release a more-detailed plan later this year, officials said. Final negotiations aimed at increasing national climate targets is scheduled by the U.N. for November in Glasgow.

Full text: President Biden is expected this week to call for cutting U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions roughly in half by 2030, according to people familiar with the matter, as he pushes to jump-start global efforts to tackle climate change.
Mr. Biden will release the new goal during a virtual summit at the White House on Thursday and Friday, part of an effort to assert global leadership on climate issues amid tensions with China. The new target seeks to reduce over the next nine years emissions by 50% from levels in 2005. Emissions last year were already projected to be down 21% from that 2005 baseline, due in part to a slowdown related to the pandemic. But this year, emissions are tracking higher again as the economy recovers.
John Kerry, the Biden administration's special climate envoy, and Gina McCarthy, the White House's national climate adviser, briefed a group of Senate Democrats Wednesday afternoon on the target, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The White House declined to comment on the briefing.
Administration officials said 40 world leaders would participate in this week's climate summit. Mr. Biden invited a group that comprises European allies and some autocrats from U.S. rivals that are among the world's biggest emitters and fossil-fuel producers, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House has noted that invitees include 17 countries responsible for about 80% of all global emissions, an effort to supercharge ambitions going into negotiations scheduled for November to raise targets for reducing emissions.
Some developing countries are expected to use the summit to urge wealthier nations to help finance efforts to reduce emissions and to adapt to the effects of a warming planet. Brazil has asked the Biden administration for $1 billion in exchange for it reducing deforestation by 40%. India, meantime, has also stressed to the U.S. the importance of industrialized countries making good on pledges to mobilize as much as $100 billion a year in support of similar efforts.
Mr. Biden is facing pressure to convince other nations and his Republican opponents at home that he can get China to commit to more ambitious efforts to slash emissions.
"Unless China stops its uninhibited growth of emissions, anything we do will be offset fourfold by the Chinese," said Rep. Garret Graves (R., La.), the top Republican on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
The Biden administration seeks to show the U.S. is committed to lowering emissions after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. The new target will likely be seen by other nations and environmental groups as ambitious, said advocates, some of whom had briefed the White House in recent weeks on data arguing that the 50% target is achievable.
"That's the kind of number that they're going to need to be credible in the international community," said Heather Zichal, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, a trade group, who was a top climate adviser to President Barack Obama.
A White House official declined to comment on the target, adding that it had not been completed.
Mr. Biden's emissions target is certain to face criticism from GOP lawmakers and some in the business community who worry that the administration's climate policies could harm the economy. Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas) criticized the Paris agreement this week, arguing it "disproportionately penalizes American workers."
Other businesses will loudly support Mr. Biden's move. More than 300 of them -- including Apple Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Walmart Inc. -- signed an open letter last week to Mr. Biden saying a 50% cut is the least he should adopt.
Mr. Kerry met with Chinese officials in Shanghai last week in a bid to restart bilateral climate discussions between the two nations. Following the meeting, the U.S. and China said in a joint statement that they would work together to set more ambitious goals to tackle climate change. Mr. Kerry told reporters that the two sides discussed the possibility of China enhancing the commitments. Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in September that China would reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality -- net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions -- by 2060.
Mr. Kerry said in an interview last week that China's pledge to achieve net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions by 2060 isn't fast enough, and he prodded the country to go further.

Full text: Brazil's government, widely criticized by environmental groups as a negligent steward of the Amazon rainforest, has made an audacious offer to the Biden administration: Provide $1 billion and President Jair Bolsonaro's administration will reduce deforestation by 40%.
The proposal was made as the Brazilian president -- who oversees the world's largest rainforest, a biome essential for a stable global climate -- prepares for a virtual environmental summit with roughly 40 heads of state hosted on Thursday and Friday by President Biden, who has made battling climate change a centerpiece of his administration.
European governments and activists have publicly expressed misgivings with Mr. Bolsonaro's proposals because he has trimmed funds for environmental-protection agencies amid an increase in deforestation.
But supported by some influential scholars and Amazon dwellers, Mr. Bolsonaro argues that the only way to save the jungle is through carbon credits and by financing sustainable economic activities so people can make a living from fish farming, cacao production and other activities that don't require the razing of trees. The theme has been central to talks Brazil's environment minister, Ricardo Salles, said he has had in recent weeks with Biden administration climate officials.
The request is likely just among the first of many similar to follow as developing nations start to negotiate with industrialized countries about who pays for costly programs to address climate change. This fall, the nations of the world are to set new, more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, and developing countries want their richer peers to make good on pledges from the original Paris climate negotiations to mobilize $100 billion a year in public and private financing for them.
Top Indian officials made that among their top requests to John Kerry, the Biden administration's special envoy on climate change, when he visited this month, according to the Indian Finance Ministry on Twitter. Officials from these countries, including Brazil, say industrialized nations must account for their historic contributions to climate change and the need for citizens in poorer countries to rise out of poverty.
"We need to focus on the people, the 23 [million] or 25 million people who live in the Amazon," Mr. Salles told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. "It's an area where you have the worst human-development index in the whole country. That's why illegal activities have been so attractive."
Mr. Salles said Brazil has taken to heart Mr. Biden's comments, made in a presidential debate last September, to gather $20 billion from around the world to help Brazil's government cut forest destruction. The minister calculated that Brazil is entitled to as much as $294 billion for the big reductions the country made curtailing deforestation, even though they occurred long before Mr. Bolsonaro took office in 2019.
"We think that $1 billion, which is only 5% of the $20 billion that were mentioned during the campaign . . . is a very reasonable amount that can be mobilized up front," Mr. Salles said.
He said a third of that $1 billion would be used to deploy specialized battalions to enforce environmental laws, while the remaining two-thirds would help fund nascent bio-industries that would provide alternatives to poor farmers who slash and burn to raise crops and cattle. Brazil says that with foreign aid, it would end deforestation by 2030.
"If we don't give these people this economic support," Mr. Salles said, "they will continue to be co-opted or incentivized by illegal activities."
Biden administration officials didn't respond to questions specifically about the Bolsonaro administration's request for $1 billion. But a climate team headed by Mr. Kerry at the State Department sees Brazil as an important partner in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
"We have a lot of work to do" before there's an agreement, Mr. Kerry told reporters on Sunday as he explained direct discussions on financing forest protection that are taking place with Brazil. "But we think it's really worth working at because the rainforest is so critical, as a carbon sink, as a consumer of carbon, and it's at risk."
Mr. Kerry and other State Department officials also stressed the need for the Bolsonaro government to demonstrate its commitment to the environment by decreasing deforestation substantially.
"We want to see very clear tangible steps to increase effective enforcement and a political signal that illegal deforestation and encroachment will not be tolerated," a State Department spokesman said.
Environmental activists worry that by engaging Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. Biden is enabling the Brazilian leader's pro-development policy and further fueling destruction in the rainforest. Under Mr. Bolsonaro's watch, Amazon deforestation jumped by 9.5% in the year ended July 31, a 12-year high.
"The government's credibility to collect funds from other governments is entirely damaged," said Carlos Rittl, a senior fellow at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Germany.
In contrast, Dan Nepstad, president of the Earth Innovation Institute, a Berkeley, Calif.-based environmental group that works with Brazilian farmers and government officials to support sustainable activity, said the Biden team's strategy of "engaging and building up that dialogue has been a very wise move."

Full text: The U.S. and China, the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, said they would work together to set more ambitious goals to tackle climate change, a rare statement of agreement at a time of heightened bilateral tensions.
John Kerry, the Biden administration's special envoy on climate change, said Sunday that his meetings with his counterparts in Shanghai were productive, adding that the two sides discussed the possibility of China "enhancing" the commitments that leader Xi Jinping made last September, to reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality -- net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions -- by 2060.
"This is the first time China has joined in saying it's a crisis," Mr. Kerry told reporters in Seoul, a day after wrapping up a four-day China tour to meet with climate officials. Mr. Kerry said that the Chinese delegation underscored that the climate issue must "be addressed with urgency. And they talked about 'enhancing.' So the language is strong."
The joint statement also said the U.S. and China would cooperate to provide investment and financing for developing countries to shift their economies toward lower emissions.
China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment said in a separate post on its official WeChat account that "China and the United States will strengthen cooperation and work together with other parties to address the climate crisis."
During his time in Shanghai, Mr. Kerry, the first senior Biden administration official to visit China, met face-to-face with counterpart Xie Zhenhua and talked to Vice Premier Han Zheng by video link, state news agency Xinhua reported. "We talked a lot about coal," Mr. Kerry said.
Mr. Kerry's Asia trip comes before President Biden hosts a virtual climate summit to mark Earth Day, having invited the leaders of 40 countries to join the April 22-23 event.
Mr. Xi hasn't formally confirmed his attendance, but people familiar with the matter said he would participate. Sunday's joint U.S.-China statement said only that both countries "look forward" to the summit.
At the end of the Earth Day summit, the Biden administration is expected to announce a new goal for reducing U.S. emissions. The meeting is intended to build momentum ahead of a United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November. Climate negotiators are seeking to set more ambitious climate goals than those agreed to in the Paris climate pact, which aims to cap average global annual temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius.
If China makes a more robust pledge on climate, it may choose to do so before Mr. Biden's summit. Chinese leaders on Sunday open their own international meeting, the Bo'ao Forum for Asia, on the southern island of Hainan.
Mr. Kerry's visit took place amid heightened tensions between the two countries and bilateral frictions over trade, technology and human rights. But the Biden administration has also said it wants to carve out space for cooperation with Beijing on climate change, nuclear proliferation and the global pandemic response.
The end of overseas coal financing is almost certainly decided, according to a person familiar with the discussions. In recent months, Beijing has signaled an increased willingness to tackle climate issues, with China's main economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, now drafting a climate road map, according to people familiar with the process.
"It is an encouraging step towards cooperation amid great geopolitical challenges," Zou Ji, a Paris Agreement negotiator for China and the current president of Beijing-based nonprofit Energy Foundation China, said of the U.S.-China negotiations and joint statement.

Given the circumstances, Scientific American has agreed with major news outlets worldwide to start using the term "climate emergency" in its coverage of climate change. . . .
This idea is not a journalistic fancy. We are on solid scientific ground. In January Scientific American published an article about a study entitled "World Scientists' Warning of a Climate Emergency." . . .
Journalism should reflect what science says: the climate emergency is here. . . .

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Senate confirmed Gary Gensler as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, putting a veteran regulator and banker in charge of the Biden administration's plan to tighten oversight of Wall Street.
Senators voted 53-45 to approve Mr. Gensler's nomination, making him the most prominent financial regulator that President Biden has hired to date. He received support from three Republicans, reflecting the GOP's limited appetite for a policy agenda that is expected to include requiring more disclosure from public companies on matters such as the potential impact of climate change on their businesses.
Mr. Gensler takes the job at a hectic time for markets. The stock market continues to break records, while individual investors make risky bets on some stocks such as GameStop. In addition, more companies are gaining access to public markets through special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which require less disclosure than traditional IPOs.
"Any chairman comes to the SEC with their ideas of what they want their priorities to be," said David Grim, a partner at Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young who formerly served as an SEC division director. "But those priorities are in some ways at the mercy of what's happening in the markets at the time."
A onetime Goldman Sachs executive, Mr. Gensler is known in Washington as a hard-nosed regulator who succeeded in overhauling the swaps market after the financial crisis. The rules he implemented as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 2009 to 2013 are widely credited with shoring up the market's resilience during last year's turmoil amid the pandemic.
Progressives who supported his nomination are hopeful that Mr. Gensler will pursue a similarly ambitious agenda at the SEC, a 4,300-employee agency that polices the stock market and dictates disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies.
"The SEC has been asleep on the job for long enough," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) told Mr. Gensler during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Banking Committee in March. "It's time for the commission to get up off its behind and protect investors and consumers."
At the top of Democrats' priority list for the SEC is requiring companies to disclose more information about risks they face from climate change, an approach to which Mr. Gensler has expressed openness. The agency, now led by acting Chairwoman Allison Herren Lee, said last month it plans to increase scrutiny of companies that mislead investors when touting socially responsible strategies.
"There's tens of trillions of dollars of invested assets that are looking for more information about climate risk," Mr. Gensler said during his hearing. "I think then the SEC has a role to play to help bring some consistency and comparability to those guidelines."
Conservatives warn that saddling public companies with additional requirements could hamper their competitiveness. "I'm concerned [Mr. Gensler] will cause the SEC to use its regulatory powers to advance a liberal social agenda," said Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.).

Full text: Top intelligence officials are testifying before Congress Wednesday and Thursday on global threats facing America. Such open sessions, complemented by closed hearings and classified and unclassified written reports, were annual events until President Trump halted them in 2019. He intensely disliked media reporting on testimony about Russian meddling in U.S. elections, reflecting his concern for his personal rather than national interests.
These hearings, or any public discussion of intelligence matters, are limited by legitimate concerns for protecting sensitive information and intelligence sources and methods. Even so, open hearings and unclassified reports have proved enormously helpful in public debate. What should this week's testimony include, and by what standards should it be judged?
The principal risk to intelligence integrity is politicization, a charge routinely hurled across the political spectrum. Several new Biden administration officials will testify for the first time this week, so it is timely to stress continued strengthening of the wall between intelligence and policy making. Molding intelligence to fit an administration's policy preferences is a constant danger, as is arguing that particular intelligence compels a particular policy. The former threat seems easier to spot, but the two are equally pernicious. Only rarely is any intelligence (or information generally, however acquired) such a show stopper that it dictates policy. Data and intelligence analysis or judgments, especially the latter two, don't end debate but inform it.
The hearings' headline subjects should be China and Russia. How the intelligence leaders handle these strategic threats will speak volumes about their likely future performance. They have the opportunity to provide comprehensive analysis of threats from Beijing and Moscow, similar in some ways to Vice President Mike Pence's October 2018 speech on China. While we can expect ample commentary on Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. and other Western elections, the sheer scope of China's efforts to shape U.S. public opinion is of a different order of magnitude, as Mr. Pence made clear. Although it's politically tempting, witnesses would be wrong to play down Chinese operations in an attempt to score points off Mr. Trump's unhappiness with discussions of Russian interference. Americans need the fullest possible picture of Beijing's machinations, especially from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, consistent with classification needs.
Moscow's adventurism in the former Soviet Union is on display as troops mass near Ukraine's border, and its military presence in the Middle East is growing. Beijing's expansionism in the South China Sea and elsewhere is also accelerating. Both are major threats in cyberspace. While there are important judgments to be made about Russia's objectives and capabilities during renegotiation of the New Start Treaty, the intelligence community should also discuss the threats posed by China's expanding nuclear program. The sheer scope of Chinese and Russian military activity, across all war-fighting domains, hardly figured in the 2020 presidential campaign, and needs underlining now. The intelligence leaders have much to warn about.
Given the Joe Biden-John Kerry emphasis on climate change, one could make over-and-under wagers about how much testimony will dwell on this topic, but it will be especially interesting to see how climate issues color the China analysis. Minimizing the threat Beijing poses to avoid endangering possible climate-related agreements would be a grave mistake. On climate change itself, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but "intelligence" adds no special value that makes these witnesses' opinions better than others, especially on long-range predictions. We don't need a Clandestine Oceanic and Atmospheric Service. Recalling Vice President Al Gore's penchant for probing intelligence analysts on environmental issues, however, we should watch the testimony carefully for signs covert agents will again fear being tasked to spy on trees and whales.
Terrorism and proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons require considerable emphasis, with a focus on North Korea and Iran. Almost anything said about Pyongyang's continuing efforts to get deliverable nuclear weapons will be an important corrective for Mr. Trump's essentially willful ignorance and silence here.
The Taliban, al Qaeda and ISIS remain dangerous threats, but Iran is today's main source of terrorism, both direct and through proxies, compounded by the Quds Force's extensive conventional military presence around the Middle East. Equally important, the Biden administration's dangerously visible yearning to renew the Iran nuclear deal highlights why the relevant intelligence testimony warrants careful scrutiny. Career State Department officials misshaped a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, which decisively concluded that Tehran had abandoned its nuclear-weapons program. They hoped thereby to forestall what they feared was George W. Bush's imminent intention to destroy it by military action. For good or ill, that wasn't Mr. Bush's intention. Nonetheless, the 2007 NIE's politicization ranks as one of the worst-ever examples of the genre.
This week's hearing should be lengthy, and will provide the measures to score the Biden administration's attitudes toward intelligence. I for one am nervous.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said the Biden administration won't compromise with China on economic issues or human rights in its attempts to negotiate a deal to address climate change.
Mr. Kerry, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, said his team is committed to finding ways to force China to be accountable for pledges it makes in negotiations to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute to climate change.
An industrial powerhouse, China is the world's biggest source of greenhouse gases. Mr. Kerry said satellites and other new technology will allow the U.S. to monitor national emissions around the globe, and noted that European countries have discussed levying a special tax on imported goods based on emissions from their production.
"You need accountability," Mr. Kerry said in his office at State Department headquarters. "We will have enormous visibility, and that visibility has been very effective at creating accountability."
Mr. Kerry made his comments before departing from Washington for three days of scheduled meetings with senior Chinese officials in Shanghai on climate change and economic issues.
Rep. Garret Graves (R., La.)., the top Republican on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, agreed that Mr. Kerry must press China to curb emissions. But he expressed skepticism that Mr. Kerry could ultimately get China to accept efforts to verify that it is fulfilling any promise to lower emissions.
State Department officials said the goal of the trip is to get China to reduce emissions more quickly. Mr. Kerry said he has already been in talks with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, and other Chinese officials.
"We are talking to China about talking," Mr. Kerry said. "We need, obviously, to have China at the table in order to be able to resolve this challenge."
Mr. Kerry's visit to Shanghai will make him the first senior Biden administration official to visit China. It comes on the heels of contentious talks in March between the two countries' top-ranking diplomats in Alaska.
Mr. Kerry has been on a series of trips ahead of a virtual climate summit that President Biden is hosting with world leaders next week. Mr. Kerry met previously with European allies and last week with leaders in India and the Middle East.
Mr. Biden had campaigned on promises to address climate change, but because emissions are global he is limited in what he can accomplish without international cooperation. He moved to rejoin the Paris climate accord -- from which former GOP President Donald Trump had exited -- within hours of his Jan. 20 inauguration.
"The climate issue is a free-standing issue. It's not for trade against the other critical differences that we have with China right now," Mr. Kerry said, adding that he had effectively negotiated with China on the Paris agreement. "Those have got to be channeled separately. Climate is about the survival of the planet."

Full text: PARIS -- France's Veolia Environnement SA reached a $15.5 billion deal to acquire Suez SA, creating a water and waste-management giant that aims to soak up a global surge in infrastructure and climate-change spending.
The companies turned the page on months of acrimony and legal battles Monday, striking a preliminary agreement for Veolia to purchase Suez shares for 20.50 euros apiece, compared with an initial offer of 15.50 euros. The combined entity would generate annual revenue of 37 billion euros, equivalent to $44 billion, across five continents.
The deal comes at a time when governments world-wide are boosting spending on infrastructure as part of efforts to recover from the pandemic and overhaul their economies to meet commitments under the Paris climate accord.
President Biden this month unveiled a $1.52 trillion budget outline focused on climate change and infrastructure. The European Union in July last year agreed on a 750 billion euros recovery fund designed to spark an industrial transformation centered on a European Green Deal.
Water and waste-management services are grappling with a transition to greener technologies that will require an overhaul in the operations of local services ranging from trash collection and water treatment to recycling and the production of energy from industrial waste. Veolia estimates this transition will create a global market of nearly 1 trillion euros.
Veolia Chief Executive Antoine Frerot said the deal would forge a "world champion of ecological transformation around Veolia, offering France a reference player in a sector that is probably the most important of this century."
Veolia's struggle to acquire Suez, however, shows how difficult consolidation remains in a sector that is highly fragmented and enmeshed with local politics. Veolia, the sector's largest company by market value, has a major footprint in France as well as Central and Eastern Europe and the U.K. Suez, its closest rival, is strongest in Northern Europe -- including France -- and Spain. But together, the companies will only account for about 5% of the global water and waste market, according to Veolia.
The two firms have been rivals since the 1800s. Veolia was created by imperial decree in 1853, starting life as the Compagnie Generale des Eaux with two main goals: to irrigate the French countryside and supply water to towns and cities. The 150-year-old Suez, meanwhile, takes its name from the company that built the canal linking the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, revolutionizing global trade.
In August, Veolia made an offer to purchase a 29.9% stake in Suez from the company's largest shareholder, French utility Engie SA.
Suez rebuffed the move as hostile, adopting a poison-pill defense that placed its French water operations in a newly created foundation based in the Netherlands. That made Suez's water assets difficult to sell -- a key step in satisfying antitrust requirements as part of any acquisition by Veolia. Suez also went looking for other suitors and made an unsuccessful court challenge to Veolia's plans to buy the Engie stake.
Engie's biggest shareholder, the French government, was concerned a merger would lead to job cuts in France. In the end, Paris brokered a compromise with Veolia sweetening its offer to take over the entire company. Veolia agreed to place many of Suez's French operations in a smaller company that will be owned by private-equity groups and French shareholders.
Investors cheered the agreement, with Suez shares rising 7.7% in Paris trading and Veolia up 9.7%.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden is seeking more funding for education, healthcare, research and renewable energy next year in a $1.52 trillion spending plan reflecting his vision of an expansive federal government that tackles issues ranging from climate change to racial inequality.
The preliminary plan released Friday by the White House would raise discretionary spending by 8.4%, or $118 billion, from the $1.4 trillion authorized last year, excluding emergency measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Discretionary spending is the part of the budget that Congress shapes through the appropriations process.
Nondefense spending would rise 16% next fiscal year to $769.4 billion. Spending on defense would increase 1.7% to $753 billion -- much less than Republicans are likely to support but more than called for by progressives, who pushed for cuts during the Trump administration.
The proposal fulfills some of Mr. Biden's campaign promises, including more money for schools in high-poverty areas, cancer research and investments to address climate change. It drew immediate opposition from some Republican lawmakers, who called it an intrusive expansion of federal power.
The request would lift nondefense spending as a share of gross domestic product to 3.3%, roughly in line with its average over the past 30 years, officials said. It will be followed later this spring by a full budget proposal that includes mandatory spending programs such as Social Security, tax increases and the impact over the next decade on deficits, debt and the economy.
White House officials said the plan aimed to make long-overdue investments in core public services and agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Head Start program.
Republican lawmakers assailed the plan.
"From everything we have seen and heard, President Biden's policies will only grow Washington's power and coercive influence which harms America's working class," Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, the top Republican on the House Budget Committee, said in a statement Friday.
Some Democrats criticized the plan for not doing more to trim military spending.
"A proposed increase of $13 billion in military spending is far too much given its already rapid growth at a time of relative peace," said Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who has helped lead a push from House Democrats to winnow the Pentagon's budget.
He praised the White House's decision to stop separately funding the Overseas Contingency Operations, an emergency war fund that had become a way for lawmakers of both parties to boost military spending because it wasn't subject to earlier budget limits, though he urged the administration to lower the amount of money it received through the defense budget.
Mr. Biden's first funding request is separate from his $2.3 trillion economic plan, which would include investments in infrastructure, such as rebuilding roads and bridges and expanding broadband access, as well as new spending on renewable energy and funding for long-term care for the disabled and elderly.
The president, during an economic briefing with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, highlighted funds for healthcare research, opioid treatment and prevention, schools and climate change. "I look forward to working with Congress to advance these and other priorities," Mr. Biden said.
The blueprint contrasts sharply with the priorities of former President Donald Trump, whose last budget request called for steep reductions in social safety-net programs, such as nutrition assistance and Medicaid, and higher outlays for defense and the space program. Mr. Trump's last budget proposed to lower nondefense spending by 5% in fiscal 2021 and increase military spending by 0.3%
Since then, Republicans have called for more military spending but warned other domestic spending should be reined in, after Congress authorized nearly $6 trillion over the past year to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. budget gap tripled in fiscal year 2020.
A White House budget serves as a recommendation to Congress and reflects an administration's priorities in spending negotiations for the next fiscal year. It is likely to be rewritten in coming months as lawmakers craft their own spending measures.
In their first years in office, recent presidents have typically submitted broad overviews of their budget priorities in February or March, followed by a joint address to lawmakers. A more detailed budget proposal is then submitted months later, often in April or May.
The White House has previously said its budget proposal would be delayed in part because of a lack of cooperation during the transition from budget staff in Mr. Trump's administration.

Full text: China's ambitions to develop a massive rare-earth mine has run into a maelstrom of local politics in a part of the world the U.S. considers vital to its national security interests.
The U.S., China and the European Union have been circling Greenland in recent years as they jockey for influence in a region undergoing transformation as a result of climate change. Warming temperatures and melting ice have opened up the possibility of new shipping routes in the Arctic Sea as well as resource extraction.
China's rare-earths giant Shenghe Resources Holding Co. and an Australian firm were on the cusp of developing a mine along the ice-bound island's southern coast when Greenland's government called a snap election amid mounting controversy over the project's impact on the environment.
Greenland's left-wing pro-environment party Inuit Ataqatigiit finished first Wednesday with 37% of the vote, paving the way for IA's 34-year-old leader, Mute Egede, to form a coalition government. The incumbent center-left party Siumut, meaning Forward, won only 29% of the vote after backing the mining project.
The election leaves in limbo a project that is part of Beijing's quest to increase its grip on rare earths -- the raw materials necessary to make the batteries and magnets that power everything from cellphones and electric cars to wind turbines. Global demand for rare earths is forecast to soar, as nations push to meet their commitments under the Paris Climate Accord, which President Biden has decided to rejoin.
China mines over 70% of the world's rare earths and is responsible for 90% of the complex process to turn them into magnets, according to Adamas Intelligence, which provides research on minerals and metals. The mining project in Kvanefjeld, a mountainous area in Greenland known in Inuit as Kuannersuit, was expected to produce 10% of the world's rare earths, according to Greenland Minerals, an Australia-based firm that holds the project's exploratory license.
Shenghe, one of the world's biggest producers of rare-earths materials, acquired a 12.5% stake in Greenland Minerals in 2016, making it the company's largest shareholder. Since then, Shenghe's stake has been diluted to 9%, but Greenland Minerals is relying on the Chinese firm to process any materials it extracts from Greenland, a technically challenging step that is key to the project's viability.
The concession includes uranium deposits, which locals fear could be released into the pristine natural landscape and farms. The project is also forecast to raise Greenland's carbon-dioxide emissions by 45%.
Miles Guy, Greenland Minerals' chief financial officer, said the firm had been on the verge of clearing the final hurdles in a yearslong regulatory marathon when the election was called. The firm has invested 130 million Australian dollars (US$99 million) in the project. "In our view it would be an extreme display of bad faith to suddenly reverse all that," he said.
Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit, said the election result gave her party a strong mandate to oppose the mine. "It would be devastating for Greenland," Ms. Larsen said.
At stake is Greenland's path toward independence. The island is still partly governed by Denmark, which helms the country's defense and foreign-affairs portfolio and gives Greenland an annual block grant of roughly 3.9 billion Danish krone ($623 million) to help fund basic services. Declaring complete independence from Denmark would require Greenland's mainly Inuit population of 56,000 to find another source of income to compensate for the loss of that grant.
Mr. Guy said the Kvanefjeld project is expected to generate $200 million in annual tax revenue for the government as well as hundreds of local jobs.
Caught in the middle of the geopolitical maneuvering are the residents of fishing villages that dot Greenland's southern coastline. Narsaq, a town of about 1,300, feared the environmental damage that the project could unleash. Uranium mining is a deeply polarizing issue in Greenland, whose 1988 ban on extracting radioactive materials was lifted in 2014 by a single vote in parliament.
Debates within the ruling party forced Prime Minister Kim Kielsen to relinquish a party chairmanship post last year. "This is, no doubt, the most controversial project in Greenland currently," said Martin Breum, lead correspondent for the Arctic Journal and a longtime writer on Greenland's internal politics. "We are talking about one of the largest [rare earth] deposits outside China."
The election doesn't totally foreclose the possibility of rare-earth mining in Greenland.
The IA party would be open to a referendum on the project, if any of its potential coalition partners insisted on one as a condition for joining the government, Ms. Larsen said.

Full text: A billionaire British hedge-fund manager's campaign to make large public companies set near-term targets for carbon-emission cuts is encountering challenges from U.S. corporations and money managers.
More than a dozen companies in Europe, Canada and Australia have signed onto Chris Hohn's "Say on Climate" initiative, according to data from Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. The drive has also aimed to make companies' emission targets subject to annual shareholder votes. But in recent weeks, U.S. cable provider Charter Communications Inc. and railroad operator Union Pacific Corp. decided to oppose Mr. Hohn's proposed shareholder resolutions.
Some large U.S. fund managers also took issue with aspects of the proposals. State Street Corp., one of the biggest money managers in the country, doesn't think companies with strong environmental track records should have their carbon-emission plans put to shareholder votes, said Ben Colton, the Boston-based firm's global co-head of asset stewardship.
Going forward, Say on Climate will shift its approach in the U.S., only recommending votes to disapprove of a company's emission plan if a shareholder finds it deficient, said Mr. Hohn, who has been holding talks with U.S. investor groups on the matter. The campaign will continue seeking mandatory emissions disclosure and plans in all cases.
"There's widespread investor support for annual disclosure of emissions and a plan to manage them," Mr. Hohn said. The disagreement over the shareholder vote prompted the new approach for U.S. companies, he said.
Many on Wall Street view the debate over the activist agenda as a test of how corporations and giant asset managers fulfill their public commitments to address climate change. BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, has advocated for using proxy votes to address climate change.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- U.S. climate envoy John Kerry is planning to travel to India and the United Arab Emirates in the coming days to increase the Biden administration's pursuit of deeper international commitments to address climate change, according to people familiar with the matter.
The trip comes ahead of an international climate summit President Biden is hosting next month and at a time when world leaders are preparing to negotiate new commitments for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Mr. Kerry plans to announce the trip Wednesday, according to some of the people. Many of the details are still being sorted, but travel could start as soon as this weekend, one of the people said.
Mr. Kerry is expected to arrive in Abu Dhabi at the end of the week, a person familiar with the details of the visit said. In Abu Dhabi, he is expected to join a regional discussion on climate to take place on Sunday. All countries in the Middle East and North Africa region have been invited to join, including Qatar, the person said.
This would be Mr. Kerry's second international trip after meeting this month with allies in Europe. It will be his first trip to Asia, a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions and a common focus of international efforts to address climate change.
The administration is making India an early stop because it is the world's third-largest emitter of the gasses that contribute to climate change, and is also seen as a more amicable partner at a time of friction with China, the world's biggest emitter. India's energy demand is likely to soar in the coming years, but the country's economy is still heavily tied to coal, a major source of greenhouse gases.
Abu Dhabi is a common stop for U.S. diplomats in transit to India, and Mr. Kerry has already made the longtime U.S. ally an early source of his attention.
In a tweet Jan. 31, he announced that he had spoken with the U.A.E.'s climate envoy and planned further collaboration with the country on technology, investment and leadership in the Middle East.
The State Department declined to comment.
Qatar's upcoming participation in the climate talks in Abu Dhabi marks the first time it has been invited to such a discussion since Saudi Arabia took steps to end a yearslong regional blockade of the Gulf nation earlier this year.
Mr. Kerry has been eager to push negotiations on climate change despite broader diplomatic friction, saying the issue is an existential threat.

'Lonesome Dove'
Author McMurtry, 84
Larry McMurtry, the prolific and popular author who took readers back to the old American West in his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "Lonesome Dove" and to modern-day emotional landscapes in the novel "Terms of Endearment," has died. He was 84 years old.
His death was confirmed Friday by a spokesman for his publisher, Liveright.
Mr. McMurtry wrote almost 50 books, including novels, biographies and essay collections. He simultaneously worked as a bookseller and screenwriter, co-writing the Oscar-winning script for the movie "Brokeback Mountain."
Several of Mr. McMurtry's books became feature films, including the Oscar winners "The Last Picture Show" and "Terms of Endearment." His epic 1986 Pulitzer winner "Lonesome Dove," about a cattle drive from Texas across the Great Plains during the 1870s, was made into a popular television miniseries that starred Robert Duvall.
He wrote his first novel, "Horseman, Pass By," at 25 years old, in 1961. It was made into the 1963 movie "Hud" starring Paul Newman.

ALABAMA
Tornadoes Wreak
Havoc, Kill 5 in South
Tornadoes and severe storms tore through the Deep South, killing at least five people as strong winds splintered trees, wrecked homes and downed power lines.
Multiple twisters sprang from a "super cell" of storms that rolled over western Georgia early Friday after spawning as many as eight tornadoes in Alabama on Thursday, said John De Block, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Birmingham.
One large, dangerous tornado moved through Newnan, destroying homes there and damaging others in surrounding communities west of Atlanta, meteorologists said.
A day earlier, one tornado formed in southwest Alabama and carved up the ground for more than an hour Thursday, traveling roughly 100 miles and causing heavy damage in the city of Centreville, south of Tuscaloosa.
Mr. De Block said it dissipated in Shelby County, where another twister had already heavily damaged homes and businesses and devastated the landscape. The county is home to suburban Birmingham cities such as Pelham and Helena and the unincorporated subdivision of Eagle Point -- all suffering heavy damage.
Still another of the eight suspected tornadoes that hit the state killed five people in Calhoun County.
Some school districts from Alabama to Ohio canceled or delayed class Friday because of damage and power outages.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION
Putin, Xi Invited
To Climate Summit
President Biden has invited 40 world leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping to participate in a virtual climate summit in April, the White House said.
Mr. Biden at the start of his administration rejoined the Paris climate pact, from which President Donald Trump withdrew. Despite friction with China over an array of issues, including trade and human rights, the Biden administration sees climate change as one area of cooperation, as well as nuclear proliferation.
Chinese officials have proposed scheduling a virtual meeting between Messrs. Xi and Biden on the sidelines, but the U.S. has so far not responded to that request.

Accused Gunman
Appears in Court
The 21-year-old gunman accused of killing 10 people at a Boulder supermarket this week made his first court appearance on Thursday, where a defense lawyer said she needed more time to look into his psychiatric condition.
Kathryn Herold, one of the public defenders representing the suspected gunman, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, told Colorado District Judge Thomas Mulvahill: "We cannot begin to assess the nature and depth of Mr. Alissa's mental illness until we have the discovery from the government."
Mr. Alissa, who faces 10 counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted first-degree murder in Monday's mass shooting, is accused of opening fire on a King Soopers grocery store using an AR-style pistol. Prosecutors on Thursday morning formally filed charges against Mr. Alissa.
Judge Mulvahill ordered Mr. Alissa held without bail until another hearing in the next two to three months. The suspected gunman, bearded and slightly disheveled, sat slumped in a wheelchair during the hearing. He was shot in the leg, law enforcement said, during a gunbattle with police responding to the scene. Mr. Alissa answered quietly "yes" to Judge Mulvahill's question as to whether he understood his rights.

WASHINGTON
Senate Passes
PPP Extension
The Senate approved a bill extending the deadline for applying for a Paycheck Protection Program loan to May 31, sending the legislation to the White House for President Biden's signature days before the current March 31 deadline.
Small-business advocates had pushed for an extension of the deadline after the Biden administration made a series of changes to the program aimed at increasing access to the funds for businesses owned by women, minorities, and rural residents. The House approved the extension last week.
The Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, offers forgivable loans to small businesses harmed by the pandemic. The government guarantees the loans lenders issue through the program.

WASHINGTON
Parler Flagged Violent
Content to the FBI
The conservative-leaning social-media network Parler referred violent content from its platform to the FBI more than 50 times in the weeks before the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, the company said Thursday, following criticism that it failed to adequately police threats ahead of the deadly attack.
Parler in December began alerting the bureau to content suggesting the possibility of violence at the Capitol as Congress met to confirm President Biden's victory, the company wrote in a letter to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which is investigating Parler and its role in the siege.
The social-media site referred a number of posts to law enforcement, including one on Dec. 24 from a user who called for an "armed force" of 150,000 people to "react to the congressional events of January 6," according to the letter, which included the post and communications with FBI officials among its exhibits and has been reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The FBI declined to comment. FBI officials have repeatedly said they had no specific, credible threats about violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and had shared information they had as quickly as possible with other law-enforcement agencies.

WASHINGTON
Oil Lobby Supports
Pricing Emissions
The oil industry's top lobbying group will push Congress for legislation to price carbon emissions across the economy, in a sharp policy turnabout a decade after the industry helped kill a similar effort to address climate change.
The board of directors of the American Petroleum Institute, which for years worked to play down the impact of climate change, on Thursday approved a "climate action framework," a sweeping plan to lower the emissions blamed for global warming.
It backs increasing government and industry collaboration, seeking to preserve a role for oil companies to solve a problem it says requires "continuous innovation."
The plan supports a price on carbon dioxide that every emitter must pay, but doesn't back any specific type of plan such as a tax. It also supports more federal research funding, regulation of methane emissions and improved industry efforts to track and reduce emissions, among other measures.
The Wall Street Journal reported this month that the group was poised to approve such a plan. Member companies at API also have been demanding the group do more to address climate change as they face their own pressure from political leaders, investors and environmental activists.
Mike Sommers, the group's president and CEO, said its decision to endorse carbon pricing reflects a change in circumstances. U.S. emissions have fallen since API's past opposition to carbon pricing, he said, and the U.S. now needs further market incentives to spur innovation to sustain that progress.

MARINE CORPS
Human Errors Cited
In Deadly Sinking
A Marine Corps investigation found the sinking of a seafaring tank last year off Southern California that killed nine service members was caused by a series of human errors and mechanical problems that could have been averted, according to a report released Thursday.
The investigation found that inadequate training of troops, shabby maintenance of the amphibious assault vehicles and poor judgment by commanders contributed to the tragedy. Three commanders were dismissed as a result, including the commander of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit who oversaw the training in the summer of 2020 off San Clemente Island, about 70 miles northwest of San Diego.
It was one of the deadliest Marine training accidents in decades.
"Ultimately this tragic mishap was preventable," wrote Lt. Gen. Steven R. Rudder, commander of U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, in his review of the investigation.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers he doesn't expect the $1.9 trillion stimulus package will lead to an unwelcome increase in inflation, but he emphasized that the central bank has tools to deal with rising price pressures if necessary.
"We might see some upward pressure on prices. Our best view is that the effect on inflation will be neither particularly large nor persistent," he said Tuesday, reiterating comments he has made repeatedly since the measure was enacted earlier this month.
Critics of the stimulus have said it will cause a surge of consumer spending that will coincide with an improving economy to stoke consumer-price increases. The measure includes $1,400 payments to most Americans and enhanced unemployment benefits to deal with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr. Powell said that the Fed remained strongly committed to keeping the public's expectations for future inflation under control, as they have been for decades, and that he didn't believe a one-time spending surge that leads to temporary price increases would change those expectations.
The central bank leader made the remarks Tuesday at his first joint appearance with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Capitol Hill, where they testified on the government's pandemic relief efforts. Both Mr. Powell and Ms. Yellen said they continue to expect a strong economic rebound this year as the vaccine distribution accelerates, social distancing measures ease and economic activity picks up. But they emphasized the recovery is far from complete.
The Fed has held its benchmark interest rate near zero since the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic slammed the U.S. economy a year ago. Mr. Powell has said repeatedly in recent weeks that the Fed is in no hurry to change its easy-money policies until it attains its goals for higher inflation and a strong labor market.
The central bank last year approved a major shift in how it sets interest rates, dropping its longstanding practice of pre-emptively lifting them to head off higher inflation. The Fed is now aiming for average inflation of 2% over time, while also pursuing its goal of maximum employment.
The consumer-price index rose by 1.7% in the year ended February, the latest sign of an upswing in prices after nearly a year of muted overall inflation as the pandemic subdued consumer spending. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, were up 1.3%.
Yields on Treasury securities have risen on expectations that strong economic growth fueled by stimulus measures and vaccinations could push inflation higher. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, a key gauge of borrowing costs throughout the economy, recently rose above 1.7% for the first time since January 2020.
Some economists and analysts worry that the Fed's policies, particularly combined with the recent large spending packages, could fuel excessive inflation. Some critics in the past worried that the Fed's policies of keeping rates low and buying bonds would encourage the federal government to borrow and spend more than otherwise, inflating government debts. Other critics say the Fed's policies contribute to inequality by pushing up prices of assets, such as stocks, that are owned mainly by the affluent.
Tuesday's hearing before the House Financial Services Committee was Ms. Yellen's first since being sworn in as Treasury secretary. She and Mr. Powell are due to testify again before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday.
The two officials are required to testify once a quarter on the $454 billion provided by the Treasury to support emergency Fed lending programs under terms of the March 2020 pandemic relief act. Most of those programs lapsed at the end of last year, and lawmakers instead used the hearing to question the two policy makers about issues ranging from climate change to budget deficits to the economic outlook.
Republicans homed in on an emerging effort among U.S. financial regulators to address risks stemming from climate change. The Fed recently created a committee to study the implications of climate change for financial institutions and infrastructure. Ms. Yellen has floated the idea of climate-related stress tests for financial institutions.
Rep. Bill Posey (R., Fla.) said the pursuit of climate-change mitigation measures "threatens affordable energy and our recently acquired energy independence" and pressed Ms. Yellen and Mr. Powell on the purpose of testing banks' vulnerability to climate risks.
"It's really very early days in trying to understand what all this means," Mr. Powell said, noting many large banks and industrial firms are voluntarily engaged in similar analyses. "It clearly can have longer-term implications -- for our economy, for our financial system and for the people that we all serve -- and I think our obligation is to try to understand that."
Republican lawmakers also challenged Ms. Yellen on the Biden administration's plan to raise taxes to pay for an infrastructure and economic package that could cost as much as $3 trillion. "It's pretty simple: If you cut taxes, you increase jobs. If you raise taxes, you cost jobs," said Rep. Roger Williams (R., Texas), who owns an auto dealer valued in financial disclosures at more than $50 million.
Ms. Yellen said President Biden's post-pandemic plans will likely need to be paid for with tax increases, such as returning the corporate tax rate to 28%. But she said those changes wouldn't come until the pandemic is over and would ultimately help the economy.

Full text: HONG KONG -- The U.S. and China are tiptoeing toward cooperation on climate change despite recent and testy high-level talks, with the two governments' chief climate envoys scheduled to come together for formal discussions this week.
The U.S. climate envoy, John Kerry, will join his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, at a virtual conference on Tuesday. China will chair the meeting of top officials from dozens of European countries, the European Union and Canada.
Tuesday's conference, known as the Ministerial on Climate Action, is an annual meeting of major economies and polluters that was set up by China, the European Union and Canada after the U.S. moved to exit from the Paris accord in 2017. Mr. Kerry's decision to join the event is intended to signal that the U.S. is back at the climate table, people familiar with the plans said.
The event marks the first formal engagement between Messrs. Kerry and Xie in the two months since the Biden administration took office, though the two have spoken informally about the possibility of setting up a more formal mechanism of engagement to tackle climate issues, the people said.
It comes on the heels of talks last week in Alaska between the most senior American and Chinese foreign-affairs officials, who sniped openly over human rights, aggression against other countries and the U.S. role in the world.
Given the tensions, the Kerry-Xie interaction marks a test of the Biden administration's China strategy, which looks to carve out cooperation on issues like climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic while the two powers compete for global influence and the control of critical technologies.
Beijing also wants to put the rivalry on a more predictable track after relations went into near-freefall during the Trump administration.
"Climate is an existential issue. It's possible to work on it even when there is great power competition," one of the people familiar with the coming Kerry-Xie meeting said.
The State Department and China's environmental protection ministry confirmed Messrs. Kerry's and Xie's attendance at Tuesday's virtual climate meeting. China said both men wouldn't meet separately during the virtual conference, while the State Department declined to comment on whether Mr. Kerry would interact directly with his Chinese counterpart.
Climate has emerged as a promising area for collaboration for the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. President Biden has made the issue a priority, vowing to make the U.S. a global leader and re-entering the landmark international accord known as the Paris Agreement, from which former President Donald Trump withdrew, saying it was unfair to the U.S.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has likewise made it known he takes climate seriously, using a policy meeting this month to reiterate China's need to restrain carbon emissions and reach carbon neutrality.
Mr. Xie and Mr. Kerry, as secretary of state in the Obama administration, worked on the Paris accord together. After Mr. Kerry was named climate envoy by Mr. Biden, the Chinese government reappointed Mr. Xie to the role he held for more than a decade before stepping down in 2018.
The Biden administration is under domestic political pressure to hew to the tough stance it has promised on China. Republican lawmakers and China hawks in the security establishment have warned that Mr. Kerry and climate negotiations might be used by Beijing as a wedge to divide the administration and soften its approach.
During Secretary of State Antony Blinken's confirmation hearing in January, Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) told him: "I hope you're never tempted to give in in your strategy with regards to China in order to obtain a climate advantage that Secretary Kerry might be promoting." Mr. Blinken shook his head in apparent agreement.
Chinese policy makers likewise worry that the U.S. could try to leverage cooperation on climate to extract concessions in other areas, said Li Shuo, a Beijing-based senior policy adviser at Greenpeace.
Following Mr. Blinken's Alaska talks with his Chinese counterparts, the official Chinese-language readout published by China's state news agency Xinhua on Saturday said Washington and Beijing would set up a working group on climate change.
In response to a request for confirmation from The Wall Street Journal, a State Department spokesman said the two sides discussed the climate crisis in Alaska but didn't form a formal working group.
Mr. Kerry said during a press conference in January that the U.S. intended to work with China on climate change as a "critical stand-alone issue" without trading at the expense of other concerns. Mr. Kerry is coordinating his work with the rest of the national security team, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
Washington and Beijing have shown a desire to ramp up leadership and rally countries to set ambitious goals ahead of a United Nations climate conference in November.

Divisive Meetings Test U.S. Ties to Beijing --- Deepening distrust on several issues signals a tough task for powers to find common ground

Full text: ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- High-level talks between the Biden administration and Beijing that veered into acrimony put the U.S.-China rivalry in sharp relief, complicating efforts by the two powers to erect guardrails and keep tensions from spiraling further.
The meetings, which ended Friday, covered an array of issues that over the past year sent U.S.-China relations to their most unsteady point in decades: China's clampdown on Hong Kong, repression of Muslims in Xinjiang and aggressive behavior with its neighbors. The two sides also explored some areas of hoped-for common ground.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters afterward that the governments "are fundamentally at odds" on issues such as Hong Kong and cyberattacks, though interests intersect on Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and climate change.
"We were clear-eyed coming in, we're clear-eyed coming out, and we will go back to Washington to take stock of where we are," national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.
Yang Jiechi, China's senior-most foreign-policy official, also noted "important disagreements" remained and in remarks to Chinese state media suggested Beijing wouldn't back down. "China will unswervingly defend its national sovereignty, security and development interests. China's development and strengthening is unstoppable," said Mr. Yang.
The talks were the first under the Biden administration and tested its strategy to compartmentalize the countries' relationship into what Mr. Blinken said are competitive, collaborative and adversarial components.
To that end, in the week before the talks, the Biden administration rallied support among allies in Asia and imposed sanctions on senior Chinese legislators -- moves that contributed to Beijing's anger as the talks opened. In his opening remarks, Mr. Blinken launched into China's cyberattacks, its threats against Taiwan and others, and its clampdowns in Xinjiang and Hong Kong as "threatening the rules-based order that maintains global stability."
Mr. Yang in turn criticized the U.S. for undermining global stability by using force around the world, and he said the U.S. doesn't serve as a model to others. He listed the U.S.'s problems with racism and declining domestic confidence in U.S. democracy.
Although U.S. officials played down the public sparring in front of reporters, it exposed a deepening distrust between the two governments that is likely to make cooperation more difficult.
"Anyone who was hoping there would be a significant de-escalation -- largely people in the business community -- can see that's not going to be possible, at least in the near term," said Allison Sherlock, a China analyst at the consultancy Eurasia Group.
Friday in their last meeting, Messrs. Blinken and Sullivan and Mr. Yang and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yigathered with a smaller group of aides to try to set up a way to manage difficulties ahead, officials said.
An early test comes next week at a virtual conference on climate change that U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, are due to attend. Climate change is an issue the Biden administration has identified for potential cooperation with Beijing, as are the pandemic and the global economy.
Beyond that, foreign-policy specialists said, the acrimony shows shifting perceptions that each has about the balance of power between the two nations, increasing the likelihood of miscalculation and conflicts over hot spots like control of critical technologies and China's claims against Taiwan and Japan and in the South China Sea.
A new target is electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. China's government is restricting use of Tesla vehicles by members of the Chinese military and employees in sensitive posts in government and business, citing national-security concerns over data collected by the cars, according to people familiar with the effort.
Both governments face pressing domestic issues, giving them reason to try to limit costly confrontation. President Biden has placed priority on reining in the pandemic and shoring up the recovery. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to seek a third term as Communist Party leader next year and can ill-afford a full-blown crisis with the U.S.
Still, he and other Chinese officials have in recent months played up perceptions that "the East is rising and the West is declining," citing the Communist Party's perceived superiority in governance.
Mr. Yang, a member of the party's ruling body, channeled that sentiment in responding to Mr. Blinken on Thursday. "The United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength," Mr. Yang said. He accused the U.S. of being condescending and waved his finger at Mr. Blinken and Mr. Sullivan.
Mr. Yang's remarks drew plaudits in China, where they were circulated on social and mainstream media.
U.S. officials accused Mr. Yang of grandstanding for a domestic audience and said Messrs. Blinken and Sullivan continued to engage their Chinese interlocutors on substance.
"We will still have business to conduct," Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House's principal deputy press secretary, told reporters. "America's approach will be undergirded by confidence in our dealing with Beijing."
A key part of the Biden strategy to compete with Beijing -- working with U.S. allies -- also angers Beijing, which sees the alliances as central to U.S.'s effort to constrain China's ascent and limit its influence.

Full text: When Hurricane Harvey stalled over Houston and dumped about 3 feet of rain in 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.'s largest campus was heavily flooded. Its global data center was inundated, along with buildings where the tech company's servers and data-storage gear were assembled.
After the floodwaters receded, Chief Executive Antonio Neri, then the company's newly appointed president, toured the facility where diesel generators ran machinery drying out rooms to prevent mold. Two months later, HPE announced it was moving all manufacturing operations out of the Houston area to locations less exposed to extreme weather.
HPE also did something few companies do: It disclosed what it said were climate-related risks to its investors.
More companies may soon be required to make more substantive climate disclosures amid growing pressure from investors and from regulators for businesses to think more about the future physical impact of changing climate patterns.
Under the Biden administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to issue rules compelling companies to do a better job of disclosing their climate-related risks.
Such disclosures pose difficult questions for companies. What is a climate risk versus a normal extreme-weather risk? The Houston region has always been prone to heavy flooding and hurricanes, for example, though some scientific research has begun to link higher ocean water temperatures with increased storm intensity.
Mr. Neri, who became CEO in February 2018, said HPE decided to do more to estimate its potential exposure to build trust with investors.
"This was a wake-up call to force us to think much more broadly" about the risks HPE faced, Mr. Neri recalled recently. The company said it has spent the past 3 1/2 years identifying existing and future vulnerabilities.
Companies are required to inform investors about all material risks they face, but the climate is often addressed in generalities. The current SEC guidance on climate disclosure is more than a decade old and focuses on the potential impact of regulations and international accords. The acting SEC chair has promised to re-examine this issue and update the guidance.
"The quality of disclosures is highly uneven and generally lousy," concluded research published last year by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. The number of companies disclosing climate-change risk has been rising over the past few years, it said, but details were often too vague to help investors.
"The big blind spot is the physical risk of climate change," said David Victor, professor at the University of California, San Diego and co-author of the Brookings paper. He added that very few companies disclose specific risks, or what they are doing to mitigate their vulnerabilities.
HPE has taken significant steps to safeguard its operations, and has done more than most to talk to investors about its steps, according to securities experts and a review of corporate disclosures by The Wall Street Journal.
Two months after Hurricane Harvey, HPE announced that it was moving all manufacturing operations out of Houston. Most went to a facility in Chippewa Falls, Wis. The reason cited is that the Midwest location is "less vulnerable to acute physical climate-related risks," according to an HPE disclosure. Other Houston operations were shifted to Guadalajara, Mexico.
The company took a $93 million charge in 2017 to pay for storm damages not covered by insurance claims. Beyond that, it didn't disclose costs related to moving its headquarters and other operations to Texas from California, or the cost of its work assessing its climate-related risks.
A year later, in 2018, HPE was one of the first to publicly estimate how it would fare under two climate scenarios: a global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, and a temperature increase of more than 2 degrees. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure, a group created by the international Financial Stability Board, had recommended that companies conduct the stress test to gauge risks.
HPE projected that an increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius could result in "extreme weather events" that could cost the company $800 million, versus $200 million for the smaller temperature increase. The company also concluded that the lower temperature increase presented a large market opportunity, as companies invest in cloud computing -- and purchase HPE equipment -- to use technology to find solutions. It reran these scenarios the following year using improved models.
Mr. Neri said a key conclusion was that HPE had more to gain than to lose from confronting climate change, if it moved quickly.
"Definitely climate change is going to have a huge impact to our society and the business overall," he said. "I don't think we have a lot of time. We have to do more, and we have to go faster."
In December 2019, HPE expanded its disclosures of risks and the need to build additional resiliency. "Climate change serves as a risk multiplier increasing both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our world-wide business operations," the company stated in its annual securities filing.
Last year, HPE convened workshops including executives who handled siting of its operations, risk management and other business units. They examined four future climate scenarios designed to "test the extremes of those uncertainties" and develop mitigation strategies. One result was to incorporate more climate risk analysis into supply-chain planning decisions, to "buffer HPE from supply chain disruptions," according to a company synopsis of the workshop.
HPE's emphasis on building more climate-resilient operations is already paying off, Mr. Neri said. Investors are asking more questions, he said, and customers are giving preference in contract bids for sustainability practices, such as reducing its carbon emissions.
Mr. Neri said he calculated that the company was awarded $847 million in contracts in the fiscal year that ended in October because of extra consideration from its climate engagement. It booked $27 billion in total revenue over the same span.
Meanwhile, HPE has stuck with a pledge to eliminate greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations and product use by 2050. Mr. Neri says he plans to eliminate emissions, not purchase carbon offsets.
The company announced in December that it is leaving Silicon Valley for the Lone Star State. But its new campus, scheduled to open in early 2022, demonstrates it is committed to doing things differently now.
It is in the Houston suburb of Spring, intentionally located 21 feet above the crest of Hurricane Harvey flooding, and is further from the coast.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In the first months of President Biden's term, Democrats on Capitol Hill unified around his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, quickly passing through Congress a package that closely resembled Mr. Biden's original plan and notching an early achievement.
But Mr. Biden and Democrats will face a far more complicated set of political and policy decisions as they seek to move forward with Mr. Biden's push for infrastructure and climate legislation.
Without a looming deadline like expiring unemployment aid, which helped to quickly mobilize Democrats on the relief measure, the process for passing another major bill could take months. Lawmakers will need to work out the scope of the package, whether and how to raise taxes to pay for it, how to address procedural limits on the legislation, and whether to tailor it so it receives Republican support.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) signaled on Friday that she wants to get started on the issue, beginning with a bipartisan effort instead of immediately resorting to the partisan approach that enabled passage of the relief package.
"Congress must work swiftly to build on the historic Biden American Rescue Plan," she said in a statement. "To that end, I have called upon the Chairs of the Committees of jurisdiction to work with their Republican counterparts to craft a big, bold and transformational infrastructure package."
People close to the White House said the president isn't expected to publicly detail his vision for the legislation for several weeks, perhaps longer. Mr. Biden and his team are instead focused on selling the coronavirus aid law to the public in speeches.
"We haven't made a final decision yet as to what the format, the size, what the next proposal will be," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday.
The open timeline means lawmakers may pursue other big-ticket legislation first, including an effort to invest in technology and manufacturing projects aimed at countering China, while the infrastructure package comes together.
Mr. Biden has met with lawmakers from both parties to discuss infrastructure. While many Democrats see the infrastructure bill as an opportunity to invest in low-carbon energy sources and wean the economy off fossil fuels, some Republicans are skeptical of spending on initiatives to address climate change in an infrastructure bill.
The House passed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill last year that emphasized fighting climate change, and only three House Republicans supported it. Mr. Biden proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan during the campaign focused on climate change. A new broad infrastructure plan that addresses climate change could cost even more, with some Democrats expecting a price tag as high as $3 trillion.
Republicans and Democrats have started working on a narrower bill on surface transportation -- including highways and bridges -- that Congress will need to pass by the end of September. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said lawmakers were so far on track for a bipartisan product.
Democrats approved the latest coronavirus relief bill without any Republican support by using a process called reconciliation. If Democrats move forward with a smaller infrastructure package first with bipartisan support, they could then include additional provisions related to infrastructure and climate later through reconciliation, which could encompass a variety of Democratic priorities, according to people involved in the discussions.

Full text: HONG KONG -- The U.S. and China are engaged in a confidence-building exercise that could show whether the world's two largest economies can work together on shared priorities despite deep disagreements and a badly strained bilateral relationship.
Washington and Beijing are to co-chair a Group of 20 study group focusing on climate-related financial risks. It is a cautious step in a low-stakes venue. Still, neither country is eager to take credit for even such a modest initiative, underscoring sensitivities on both sides about any outreach.
In February, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told her G-20 counterparts the U.S. would co-chair the group. A day later, Chinese central bank governor Yi Gang said the bank was pleased to co-lead the group.
Neither side mentioned the other in its announcement.
"Both sides are inching closer to each other and trying to make climate a safe lane for communication," said John Podesta, founder of the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank in Washington.
The U.S. views China as its major competitor. A new Biden administration strategy document labeled China the only rival potentially capable of combining economic, diplomatic, military and technological power "to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system."
China has been trying to wean itself from dependence on U.S. technology and make clear to the new administration that it won't back off on issues of human rights or Taiwan, which Beijing views as part of China.
Still, both Beijing and the Biden administration have talked about the urgency of addressing climate change, and the need to work together on the issue.
In response to questions, the State Department pointed to remarks by Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week calling for the U.S.-China relationship to "be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be." Spokespeople for the Treasury Department declined to comment.
On Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described climate change as a common cause that could help improve U.S.-China relations.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in September that China would achieve carbon neutrality -- net zero carbon-dioxide emissions -- by 2060, with emissions peaking before 2030.
Since then, Beijing has sent other signals pointing to a turn in its domestic energy policy.
The U.S. has recently agreed to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, though the accord is criticized by climate activists who say the commitments countries have made are insufficient for keeping the world from warming by 2 degrees Celsius, the benchmark many of them cite.
Climate advocates have also expressed concern about Beijing's commitment to fighting climate change overseas. Since 2000, Chinese policy banks have extended nearly $52 billion in loans to support coal projects through its Belt and Road Initiative, according to Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.
In December, researchers at China's environment ministry and international climate advocates called for more stringent environmental criteria for Beijing's overseas investments.
Senior Chinese government officials attended the report's launch event, which has been interpreted as a signal of Beijing's willingness to reconsider its overseas climate impact.
In February, Beijing appointed Xie Zhenhua, who served as China's climate envoy from 2007 to 2018 and knows the new U.S. climate czar John Kerry from negotiations over the Paris Agreement.
Throughout 2020, Messrs. Kerry and Xie and their confidants were in regular communication, people familiar with the matter said, exchanging ideas and sounding out one another's positions as the possibility of a Biden victory became apparent.
The two men have since been in direct contact, China's Foreign Ministry said in February, while Mr. Kerry has praised Mr. Xie as "a capable advocate."
It isn't clear who the U.S. will name as the co-chair of the G-20 working group.
On China's side, the co-chair will be Ma Jun, a World Bank veteran and former chief economist at the People's Bank of China who is an expert on environmentally sustainable finance and adviser on the report in December calling for stricter environmental criteria for Chinese overseas investments.
Mr. Ma, who confirmed his appointment as China's representative on the G-20 study group in an interview, said the U.S. Treasury Department and China's central bank each proposed -- independently from one another -- upgrading the G-20 study group to a working group, which unlike a study group can make concrete policy recommendations.
The full G-20 is expected to approve the change, though the group's agenda hasn't yet been set.
The People's Bank of China didn't respond to a request to comment.

Full text: BRUSSELS -- Renewed trans-Atlantic cooperation on addressing climate change will prompt other countries to take more action and improve prospects for coming global meetings on the issue, said President Biden's special envoy for climate change, John Kerry, after meeting with allies here.
Mr. Kerry, making one of the first international trips by a senior member of the Biden administration, is meeting with leaders this week in London, Brussels and Paris, following the U.S. return to the Paris climate accord. On his agenda are efforts to coordinate with Europeans for a planned Earth Day environmental summit Mr. Biden is hosting in April and the United Nations COP26 environmental summit in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.
"This is the rekindling of a partnership that helped to make Paris happen, and we're going to work hard to make Glasgow a success," Mr. Kerry said in a meeting with European Union Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans. "Our leadership, we hope, will be critical in bringing other significant emitting nations to the table."
Mr. Biden has made tackling climate change one of his top priorities, signing an executive order returning the U.S. to the 2015 agreement hours after taking office. The U.S. officially rejoined on Feb. 19.
Former President Donald Trump had exited from the accord in 2017, saying it put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage through increased regulations and burdens on American companies. The response to climate change was one of many areas of tension between Mr. Trump and his European counterparts.

Full text: For years, Mark Brownstein of the Environmental Defense Fund felt a little foreign at Houston's big energy conference, where fossil fuels were king and conversations about climate change and clean energy were largely whispers in the hallways.
"Now, it is the main stage," said Mr. Brownstein, who has participated in the CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference since 2003. "Now, you're talking about renewables and batteries and vehicle electrification."
This year's CERAWeek is all about topics like carbon capture and investing influenced by ESG, or environmental, social and governance factors -- a sign of how swiftly the energy industry is being buffeted by the world's quickening transition to cleaner energy sources.
The influential gathering of global energy leaders, which began Monday and is being held virtually this year due to the pandemic, is a succession of CEOs and government officials detailing efforts to reinvent themselves for a lower-carbon world.
Microsoft Corp. co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates touted investments in clean-tech startups and carbon capture technologies to make the world greener. Andy Jassy, the incoming CEO of Amazon.com Inc., outlined the retail giant's push to power its operations with renewable energy. The heads of some of the world's biggest oil companies detailed how they were trying to turn into green giants to contribute to a cleaner future.
Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP PLC, said the world is running out of time to cut carbon emissions, but that his company has recognized "an enormous business opportunity" in upgrading the global energy system, which will require trillions of dollars of investment.
Mr. Looney said BP would pivot over the next decade by lifting spending on low-carbon technologies and renewable power generation and cutting fossil fuels production 40% by 2030. Those efforts, he said, will cut BP's greenhouse gas emissions between 30% and 40%.
"We've been an oil-and-gas company for 112 years and I think this is a moment where we have to reinvent the company," Mr. Looney said.
The conference's agenda underscored the new terrain the energy industry is navigating, as once-peripheral issues have become central considerations for its future. Goals to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 have become a benchmark, not only for policy makers but also for companies and investors' strategies, said energy historian and expert Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit, who leads the CERAWeek conference.
CERAWeek also marked one of the first encounters between oil executives and the new Biden administration. White House officials participating in the event said President Biden would resume U.S. collaboration with other countries to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and that financial regulators are beginning to seek input from companies as they work to set new standards for climate-risk disclosures.
On Tuesday morning, John Kerry, the Biden administration's climate envoy, said oil companies need to move faster on becoming greener energy companies and moving away from fossil fuels, both to save the planet and their bottom line. He added that people want electric cars over gasoline-powered cars.
"Where's the revenue going to come from? [Oil companies] don't want to be sitting there with stranded assets," he said. "That fight is useless. You're going to end up on the wrong side of this battle."
Mr. Jassy said Amazon, which has pledged to power itself with renewable energy by 2030, is on pace to beat that goal at data centers across its operations five years ahead of schedule. On a panel called Reinventing Energy with Mr. Looney, the CEO of BP, Mr. Jassy said companies looking to reinvent themselves are better off helping to shape that change than wishing it away.
"They have to avoid fighting gravity," he said.
Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Texas shale producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co., said during the conference that the company is set to deploy its first electric-powered drilling rig soon, but it will take years for technology to advance enough to electrify all of its oil-field equipment. Moving rigs and fracking equipment to the grid will ultimately curtail its carbon footprint further as the amount of fossil fuels powering the grid declines in coming years.
Meanwhile, investors have peppered the company's executive with questions about its ESG efforts, Mr. Sheffield noted in an interview this week.
"On a fifty-minute phone call with an investor, they probably spent 10 minutes of that phone call on ESG questions," he said.
Investors are still in the early days of defining what ESG means for American shale companies, or nearly everything else for that matter. But companies that can show that they are among the most thoughtful on environmental metrics can still attract capital in coming years, albeit at a higher cost than during the shale revolution, said Brian Singer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
The transition to cleaner energy will require the participation of old-school oil companies and up-and-coming energy firms alike, said Maynard Holt, chief executive of Houston investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Gary Gensler, President Biden's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, told senators Tuesday he would look into issues ranging from climate change to the GameStop Corp. trading frenzy if confirmed.
During a nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Gensler was asked about the marriage of social media and day trading on platforms such as Robinhood Markets Inc., which has drawn more retail investors into markets while also fueling volatility.
He also raised concerns about the business model of some online brokers, which offer commission-free transactions while selling their clients' orders to high-frequency market makers, a practice known as payment for order flow.
"I think technology has provided greater access but also raises interesting questions," he said. "What does it mean when balloons and confetti are dropping and you have behavioral prompts to get investors to do more transactions on what appears to be a free trading app, but there's also this payment behind the scenes?"
A Robinhood spokesman declined to comment.
The GameStop episode was the subject of a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee last month. The wild run-up and subsequent crash of the videogame retailer's shares, driven by social-media chatter on forums popular with small investors, have raised concerns about the stability of the U.S. stock market and the rules that govern it. The SEC and other authorities are investigating whether the saga calls for changes to market plumbing or was fueled by mischief akin to market manipulation.
Progressives, who support Mr. Gensler's nomination, are hopeful the veteran regulator will use the SEC's oversight of Wall Street and public companies as a lever to advance broad domestic policy goals, from fighting climate change to advancing diversity in the workplace.
Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), the chairman of the Banking Committee, said he expects Mr. Gensler to focus on "upgrading climate-risk disclosure requirements that are out of date, punishing misconduct and enforcing the protections on the books."
Such calls have drawn objections from Republicans who said the commission should stick to its job of regulating markets.
"The SEC has historically administered the federal securities laws on a bipartisan basis," said Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee. "There are some, however, who want the SEC to stray from its tradition of bipartisanship by using its regulatory powers to advance a liberal social agenda."
Mr. Gensler also faced questions about a proposal pending before the SEC from Nasdaq Inc. to require the thousands of companies listed on its stock exchange to include women, racial minorities and LGBT individuals on their boards.
Republicans on the Banking Committee urged the SEC to deny the proposal, saying it interferes with board members' duty to govern in the best interests of shareholders.
Mr. Gensler didn't say whether he would support the proposal but said he believes diversity enhances decision-making processes.
Democrats say the SEC should require publicly listed companies' financial disclosures to include more information about diversity and worker pay. They are also calling for more comprehensive reporting about the risks companies face from climate change or government efforts to curb it, and for disclosure of political spending by companies.
Mr. Gensler testified alongside Rohit Chopra, Mr. Biden's choice to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who told the committee that he would seek to protect Americans struggling with debt amid the coronavirus pandemic from potential abuses by lenders and look into issues such as data privacy.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The oil industry's top lobbying group is preparing to endorse setting a price on carbon emissions in what would be the strongest signal yet that oil and gas producers are ready to accept government efforts to confront climate change.
The American Petroleum Institute is poised to embrace putting a price on carbon emissions as a policy that would "lead to the most economic paths to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement," according to a draft statement reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
"API supports economy-wide carbon pricing as the primary government climate policy instrument to reduce CO2 emissions while helping keep energy affordable, instead of mandates or prescriptive regulatory action," the draft statement says.
API's executive committee was slated to discuss the proposed statement this week. In a statement to the Journal, API's senior vice president of communications, Megan Bloomgren, said the group's efforts "are focused on supporting a new U.S. contribution to the global Paris agreement."
Carbon pricing aims to discourage the production of harmful greenhouse gases by setting a price on emissions. The API draft statement would endorse the concept in principle, without backing a specific pricing scheme such as a carbon tax.
An endorsement of carbon pricing by the oil industry's most important trade group would underscore the changing politics of climate change, as major business groups acknowledge the dangers posed by greenhouse gases and adjust to a new reality in Washington. Another major business group, the Business Roundtable, endorsed carbon pricing last year.
President Biden campaigned on treating climate change as a crisis, and since he ascended to power with Democrats controlling Congress, too, several major trade groups have announced support for new climate initiatives.
API was one of the fiercest opponents just more than a decade ago when Congress last considered major legislation on the issue, a plan to have emitters pay and trade for their contributions to climate change. Now it is just the latest of several groups to support similar plans to put a price on or tax emissions, following a January announcement from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The institute's draft statement stops short of explicitly endorsing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions or other specific pricing framework, and stops short of the language of environmental activists who argue the world must transition away from fossil fuel power sources altogether.
But it does continue a reversal that has accelerated since Mr. Biden's victory. In recent weeks, API has backtracked on past opposition to direct federal regulation of the oil-and-gas industry's emissions. And it is emphasizing that the industry can play a role in helping the world address climate change. That has included laying groundwork publicly to support some form of price on carbon emissions.
In its annual State of American Energy report from January, it listed "market based government policies" to reduce emissions across the economy as a policy that would support progress. The Washington Examiner reported it was the first time this report included such language.
"The risks of climate change are real," API's annual report said. "Market-based policies can foster meaningful emissions reductions across the economy at the lowest societal cost. An example can be carbon pricing -- balancing reducing GHGs with flexibility and pacing to keep energy affordable."
Internally, many API members staunchly oppose endorsing a carbon tax or imposing standards for the use of renewable energy, according to one person familiar with the internal discussions.
The organization had similar internal conflicts over its position on methane-emissions regulations, which the Trump administration had moved to undo at the request of independent producers.

Full text: Federal officials are rushing emergency relief to Texas for its power crisis, though longer-term efforts to shore up the electric grid are likely to run into political obstacles and challenges to Washington's authority.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has deployed to hard-hit areas, providing generators and fuel, and delivering water, blankets and meals. Residents can access emergency aid funds for temporary housing, home repairs and uninsured property damage.
But political and legal issues loom over Washington's response. Federal emergency funds can't legally be used for utility bills that soared for some people, local governments and businesses in Texas' open-market system. And lobbyists and congressional aides expect Texas to keep defending a system that it has worked for years to shield from federal jurisdiction.
A cold snap unusually powerful for the state crippled Texas' electrical grid this month. It left more than four million Texans without electricity and heat, many for days in subfreezing temperatures, and resulted in 80 deaths.
President Biden on Friday traveled to Houston and met with state and local officials. He used the visit to reassure Texans struggling with the twin crises of the winter storms and the coronavirus pandemic, pledging to help the state "recover and rebuild."
"Our fellow Americans are hurting and it's our job to help everyone in need," said Mr. Biden, speaking outside NRG Stadium, where the Houston Texans football team plays. The president visited an emergency operations center and a food bank.
A disaster declaration Mr. Biden signed last Saturday now applies to more than 100 counties, opening up grants and low-cost loans for residents and business owners. The federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program may also help some subject to large utility bills.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott promised in a statewide address Wednesday to find answers to what went wrong. He said he would ensure state lawmakers enact fixes.
Beyond immediate needs, congressional committees and federal regulators are beginning to investigate how Texas' grid failed and what it suggests about future threats to reliability nationwide. They are also looking into commodity trading during the event, to examine whether market manipulation played any role in soaring prices.
Texas has few and often no requirements for buildings and power plants to weatherize, instead relying on free-market established prices to provide the incentive for businesses to do so on their own.
In a state more used to hot summers, those businesses largely ignored past federal warnings to prepare for Arctic winter chills.
Nearly 185 generating units, mostly gas and coal-fired capacity, tripped offline. The resulting shortages and unexpectedly high demand led to soaring electricity prices. Wholesale power prices were more than 400 times last year's average.
The Senate Energy Committee is preparing a hearing on grid reliability. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate gas pipelines and wholesale electricity markets, has launched three hearings, examining what happened during the cold snap, the threat of climate change to grid reliability, and potential market manipulation during the disaster
FERC's authority is limited because the grid serving most of Texas has limited links crossing state lines. The agency does have power to set new requirements for reliability.
The White House and allies in Congress are also pushing for infrastructure spending that they say could address climate change and some of the risks exposed by the Texas crisis, a push bolstered by the event, analysts said. "Clearly these types of weather events are going to be happening and more frequently," said Gina McCarthy, head of the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy. "We need to make changes, and rethink, from the bottom up, how we deliver energy and keep it reliable."
Lawmakers aren't expected to take up emergency legislation focused on the Texas disaster. While Congress has passed stand-alone aid for some large disasters, it often ties additional emergency funding into other pieces of legislation.
As part of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief plan, Democrats are seeking to provide FEMA with $50 billion in disaster-relief funds.

Fed Tries to Mitigate
Climate-Change Risks
Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said the economy and financial system are being affected by climate change, and the central bank is ramping up work to ensure the financial system can deal with the risks associated with this.
"Climate change is already imposing substantial economic costs and is projected to have a profound effect on the economy at home and abroad," Ms. Brainard said in a speech Thursday.
Her remarks come as the central bank has started moving forward more aggressively with efforts to shore up the financial system amid clear evidence that disruptive environmental events are starting to take a toll.
Ms. Brainard said the Fed's interest in shoring up the financial system against climate-change risks isn't in conflict with its legal mandate of promoting job growth. "We will be very focused on trying to understand how the climate-related risks" and efforts to transition to a more sustainable economy and financial system "might affect our economic growth over the medium to long term," she said.

SOUTH CAROLINA
Abortion Bill Signed,
Challenge Is Filed
South Carolina's governor on Thursday signed a bill banning most abortions, one of his top priorities since he took office more than four years ago. Planned Parenthood immediately sued, effectively preventing the new law from taking effect.
The South Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act, is similar to abortion restriction laws that a dozen states have previously passed. All are tied up in court. Federal law, which takes precedence over state law, allows abortion.
"There's a lot of happy hearts beating across South Carolina right now," Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said at the Statehouse. The House passed the bill by a 79-35 vote Wednesday and gave the measure final approval Thursday.
Moments after the Thursday vote, Planned Parenthood said it was filing a lawsuit. The South Carolina law, like those of other states that are currently being challenged, is "blatantly unconstitutional," said Jenny Black, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to wield the department's broad powers to tackle potential risks to the financial system posed by climate change while pushing tax incentives to reduce carbon emissions.
Ms. Yellen is looking to a veteran of the Obama administration, Sarah Bloom Raskin, as the leading candidate for a new senior position that would head a new Treasury climate "hub," according to people familiar with the matter. A former deputy Treasury secretary who once worked alongside Ms. Yellen on the Federal Reserve Board, Ms. Raskin has warned in interviews and speeches that U.S. regulators must do more to strengthen the financial system's resilience to climate risks.
The move is part of the Biden administration's effort across many government departments to address climate change and its impact on various industries. In two early moves, the administration rejoined the Paris climate accord and suspended new oil-and-gas leases on federal land.
"I think we need to seriously look at assessing the risk to the financial system from climate change," Ms. Yellen said at her Senate confirmation hearing last month, calling it an "existential threat" to the U.S. economy. Ms. Yellen said the new hub would review financial stability risks and tax policy incentives related to climate change.
Her climate push is already facing resistance from some Republicans in Congress and financial-industry officials wary of new regulatory burdens on banks after the Obama administration imposed widespread new rules following the 2008 financial crisis.
While climate risks are broadly acknowledged in the industry, there is no consensus on whether they can be mitigated through regulation.
Bank representatives say they worry U.S. policy makers could adopt some form of nonbinding climate stress tests -- which have been introduced in the U.K. -- potentially to help set bank capital requirements. They contend economic modeling is "extremely subjective and highly variable," according to Francisco Covas of the Bank Policy Institute, an industry lobbying group.
"Significant further research and testing should precede any effort to make decisions about capital adequacy or other issues based on the results of climate-related stress tests," Mr. Covas, a former Fed economist, wrote in an October research note.
Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said he was concerned regulators could use climate stress tests to keep banks from lending to the oil-and-gas industry. "Financial regulators lack the expertise to make environmental policy," he said in questions submitted to Ms. Yellen after her confirmation hearing.
Among the climate risks that Ms. Yellen and others see for the financial system are more frequent severe weather events such as flooding or wildfires that endanger assets underpinning bank loans.
For example, mortgages in coastal areas are vulnerable to hurricanes and sea level rise.
Banks' business may also be altered as countries reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, including more widespread use of electric vehicles and shifts to renewable energy resources. Such shifts could reduce the value of assets owned by oil and power companies and increase the riskiness of loans to those firms.
The new push comes as some major financial firms have taken steps in recent years to reduce their exposure to what they considered the worst climate offenders. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other international banks have also committed to aim their financing in ways that help the world meet the goals of the Paris accord.
Ms. Yellen is likely to find an ally in Jerome Powell, who succeeded her as chairman of the Fed. The central bank oversees the nation's biggest banks alongside other regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is a bureau of the Treasury.
"Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system, and the economy," Mr. Powell said at a December press conference.
The Treasury's greater consideration of climate change will also factor into tax policy and international financial diplomacy. Congress is likely to consider climate legislation this year that could include tax incentives, something the Treasury will help shape and implement. And the department will play a key role coordinating on climate issues with global counterparts through the Group of Seven and G-20 groups of leading economies.
Ms. Raskin, when she served at the Treasury under President Barack Obama, led an effort to grapple with the financial stability risks of cybersecurity. She is currently a law professor at Duke University and is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the top prosecutor in the second impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
Ms. Raskin was a key contributor last year to a report from the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Markets, a climate advocacy group, that detailed dozens of potential steps for regulators.
In addition to requiring more disclosures and stress-testing, the report said U.S. regulators should work with their global counterparts to identify activities that could exacerbate climate risks, consider encouraging banks to support sustainable investments in low-income communities, and require bank supervisors to monitor the effects of climate risk on bank lending and investment.

A Skating Dream Is Kept on Ice Due to Pandemic --- The Netherlands thought the biggest obstacle to a historic race on frozen canals was climate change. Covid-19 has brought new restrictions.

Full text: The Netherlands have been waiting 24 winters for a cold snap like this one. Not too windy, not too snowy, and temperatures sinking like a bike in a canal. That's because these are the precise conditions required for the ultimate Dutch sporting event: a 200-kilometer speedskating race on frozen waterways through 11 cities in Friesland.
It's known as the Elfstedentocht. And it's pronounced . . . don't worry about it.
Because it depends so heavily on climate, the race has been held only 15 times since 1909, most recently in 1997. There has never been a drought this long. Dutch people worried that climate change meant they would never have a winter cold enough or long enough again -- until they stepped outside last weekend and found the weather starting to cooperate with temperatures in the teens.
There is only one problem now: the Elfstedentocht stars are aligning in the middle of a pandemic. Under current Covid-19 restrictions in the Netherlands, the race would not be allowed to happen, even if the ice grows thick enough.
That hasn't stopped Dutch speed skaters from watching the weather and their government, and praying for a way to make it possible. The most famous people in the country right now are meteorologists.
"I'm looking every day, sometimes 10 times a day, at the weather models," said 53-year-old Henk Angenent, the 1997 Elfstedentocht champion and one of three living winners of the men's race. "I think the winter is coming back at the end of next week. It's what I feel."
The hype has snowballed so fast that Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is being forced to treat ice skating as a matter of state. While it would be permissible to head onto the ice with one other person, he said, any mass event simply couldn't fit with the country's rules on physical distancing. Organizers say an Elfstedentocht would attract between 1 and 2 million fans to the edge of the canals.
But the clamor for a few allowances is growing. Dutch speedskating legend Erben Wennemars laid out the case for more cold and fewer restrictions in his newspaper column.
"We have been at home for months and have no idea how long this situation will continue," he wrote in the Algemeen Dagblad. "Many people need a ray of hope. A dot on the horizon. Maybe a small miracle, a fairy tale that gives us hope again."
In any other year, an Elfstedentocht could be announced with just 48 hours notice. Organizers formally known as Royal Association of the Eleven Frisian Cities, put together a plan every winter and wait for a deep freeze. It takes two weeks of temperatures below 20 degrees Fahrenheit and ice at least 6 inches thick to support some 30,000 skaters. More often than not, the local "ice masters" have to nix the whole thing.
So when organizers declared last November that there would be no Elfstedentocht this winter, it was a safe bet that the whole exercise would be academic again. Then the first signs of ice this month made skaters start to dream.
"We've never been closer, if you look at the weather," said Immie Jonkman, a member of the Elfstedentocht's board. But, she added, much of the hype has come from the rest of the country. Frieslanders more in tune with how their canals behave have been a little more measured. "It's great to have something to think about besides corona. I think that's why people are getting so excited about ice."
Whether or not Elfstedentocht happens -- and Jonkman insists that it won't -- the Netherlands are still giddy at the prospect of what they call "natural ice." Having a chance to skate on canals again is seen as a chance to reconnect with Dutchness in a way that knocking back a Heineken or picking a bunch of tulips just can't match.
"It's a cultural heritage for us," said Richard Plugge, the director of the Jumbo-Visma cycling team who has been advising national speedskating authorities on potential Covid protocols. "The natural ice defrosts the Dutch. It makes us a warm, happy family."
Even that has become a rarity in recent years due to climate change, according to Sytse Kroes, an Ice Master who remembers skating 5 miles to school during his childhood winters. A small band of devotees in recent years have cobbled together an alternative Elfstedentocht on the Weissensee in Austria. Others make regular trips to Sweden to get their natural ice fix.
"But it's terrible," Kroes said. "In Sweden, you have to skate on lakes. Here you can skate from city to city."
Kroes talks about icy winters in Friesland like they're vintages of fine wine: 1968 was a great year. So was 1987. One subzero spell in 2012 seemed like it might produce a Grand Cru season only for the Elfstedentocht to be called off at the last moment. Ten days of freezing hadn't been enough.
One small consolation could be the running of the marathon speedskating championships for elite athletes, which haven't been held in nearly a decade. The government has expressed cautious support for the idea and the sport's governing body is studying how to create a restricted environment around a lake -- or, in Dutch, a "Natuurijs Bubbel."
All of this hinges, of course, on the Netherlands staying cold. A few extra degrees or a couple of days of snow (Kroes points out that snow ice is the enemy) could punt the entire conversation into 2022. The coming days will be crucial to determine whether any skating is possible at all. For the Elfstedentocht, however, the wait is set to continue, 24 years and counting.
"We're only at the start of an ice period," Kroes said. "But people have no patience anymore."

Full text: Cameroon's Dja Faunal Reserve is one of the largest undisturbed areas in Africa. Elephants trample through the trees, monkeys call to one another, and insects hum, all with barely any human interference. The lack of roads and dense forest have protected the biodiversity there, but the same remoteness has left the impact of climate change on the area little understood. Instead of trying to set up camp for a few weeks at a time, researchers are turning to tools they hope will gather data indefinitely.
"So often the science stops when you leave these places," says Shah Selbe, the co-founder of FieldKit, a Los Angeles nonprofit building open-source tools to collect conservation information. "If we can create low-cost tools that make monitoring easier, we can start to get more data."
Big Data has transformed industries from finance to drug discovery. Conservationists, however, haven't had the same access to deep data sets because of the difficulty and cost involved in gathering data in the wilderness.
To help, startups are developing open-source technology built to monitor the environment. The hope is that open-source tech will make it cheap enough to gather data. In turn, the data could lend greater insights into where to focus efforts to save endangered species and tackle the effects of climate change.
The open-source movement advocates sharing design information so that anyone can inspect and improve upon the tools that are built. Often, the groups behind the tech are nonprofits, typically resulting in hardware and software that are cheaper than commercial counterparts.
FieldKit makes a water-resistant device about the size of a coffee-table book that allows users to gather data on water temperature, weather conditions, pH levels and more. Launched this month, the $150 device includes a computer chip that can accommodate a variety of environmental sensors and add-ons, which run $50 to $205 each. FieldKit also offers two prebuilt models, one for water quality and another for weather conditions. Prices include a small margin to support Conservify, FieldKit's parent nonprofit, which currently relies on grants to fund its operations.
The units were built to withstand environments from rainforests to freezing tundra, and to collect data for weeks or even months at a time, says Mr. Selbe. He expects that many users will be full-time researchers affiliated with nonprofits or universities, but he says it was important to sell prebuilt kits to expand the potential audience to students and individuals without technical backgrounds.
FieldKit's website hosts the data collected on the devices. Mr. Selbe says that he hopes that most researchers will put their data on the platform, enabling even researchers and enthusiasts without FieldKits to use it.
Much of the conservation technology builds on open-source tools made for more general uses, such as Raspberry Pi's simple, single-board computer chips and Tensorflow, Google's machine-learning platform. These advances have been essential for the cash-strapped environmental research community, says Alasdair Davies, co-founder of the Arribada Initiative, a nonprofit that builds open-source technology with partners who require technical expertise.
More devices in the field mean more data, but analyzing all of it can prove impossible for solo researchers and small teams. Citizen scientists have volunteered to label, transcribe or otherwise organize data on scores of different projects, including labeling wildlife caught on camera in a New York forest and transcribing old weather logs from the U.S. Navy. Some research even requires volunteers, such as Arribada's Carnivore Bytes project, which aims to learn more about wild dogs in part by gathering data on people's pets.
Carnivore Bytes in January sent recording devices that clip onto collars to hundreds of dog owners. With an app, volunteers note when their dogs are doing things like panting, playing or eating. Eventually, the data is meant to help train an algorithm to go through wild-dog noises for insights into how climate change is impacting their lives. For example, wild dogs making fewer eating noises could suggest that prey is scarce and hunger is becoming an issue.
Open Acoustic Devices, based in the U.K., sells acoustic recording devices called AudioMoths for $60, compared with hundreds or thousands of dollars for a commercial version. Since launching in 2018, AudioMoth has sold about 20,000 units, according to co-founder Andy Hill. The sales, along with occasional work building custom software to go along with AudioMoth projects, allow Mr. Hill and another founder to work on the technology full-time, he says.
AudioMoths have been used to record thousands of hours of sound. In one project, researchers are recording marine mammal vocalizations in an effort to decode the different sounds that dolphins, manatees and whales use to communicate.
Open-source technology is also allowing more people to engage in environmental research, says Lydia Gibson, an ecologist and National Geographic explorer who uses it in her fieldwork.
Still, conservation isn't just about technology, she says. It is also about the people who use the tools and the local communities that participate, actively or not. Conservation has gotten better about including more voices and respecting local expertise, and those strides can't be lost as shiny new tools are added to research tool kits, Ms. Gibson says.
"A focus on technology needs to include a holistic view of how it's used," she says. "Technology on its own is not the solution."

Full text: Downhill skiing could become an increasingly exotic proposition in a warming world. By midcentury, the U.S. could see 90 fewer days below freezing each year, according to a 2016 study published in the Journal of Climate and based on data from the federally funded North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program. Nearly all ski areas in the U.S. are projected to have at least a 50% shorter season by 2050, according to a 2017 study funded by the Environmental Protection Agency and published in the Global Environmental Change journal.
Higher temperatures make snow more elusive on the slopes, cutting into revenues for ski areas. Low snow years between 1999 and 2010 already cost ski areas an estimated $1 billion in revenue, according to a 2012 analysis commissioned by the nonprofits Protect Our Winters and the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Today, ski areas run snow guns 24/7 as soon as cold weather hits and send GPS-guided snowcat vehicles to the slopes to distribute snowpack. Snow-making technologies are making rapid advances and could alleviate some of the burden of weather volatility. Winter skiing could also be less of a focus as resorts become year-round destinations and offer more activities. Climate change presents ski areas with an opportunity to reduce their own carbon footprint by switching to cleaner energy sources.
From autonomous snowcats to solar-powered properties, take a look at what ski resorts might look like in the coming years.
1. Fleets of Artificial Clouds
Neuschnee GmbH, an Austrian startup, has invested more than $2.2 million to develop a balloon-shaped chamber that artificially recreates a snow-making cloud. Ice particles injected into a wooden-framed structure propped on steel rods and wrapped in nylon membranes bind to water droplets to make up to 1,000 cubic feet of snowflakes a day, enough to fill a midsize truck. Founder Michael Bacher says ski resorts could use the technology to give runs a natural feel and imagines a future where operators deploy fleets of autonomous artificial clouds. The company is looking for new partnerships to continue development.
2. Enhanced Snowfalls
Modifying clouds to boost mountain snowpack, or cloud seeding, has been done over Colorado's ski areas for decades, but was scientifically proven effective only last year. It involves using generators to spray silver iodide into a frigid cloud to turn water droplets into snow, and it can increase snowfalls by up to 15%, says Neil Brackin, the CEO of Colorado-based Advanced Radar Co., a firm that sells weather radar systems. Tomorrow's generators may be more accurate and deliver more advanced seeding materials into the sky, Mr. Brackin says. Cloud-seeding programs could cost ski areas $100,000 to $1 million annually, he says.
3. Mountain Biking Is the New Skiing
Developing downhill mountain biking as a seasonal complement to winter sports could let the industry maximize the summer season and diversify revenue streams, says Rob McSkimming, a mountain resort development consultant at Select Contracts, a Canada-based tourism consulting firm. Ski areas could invest more in lift infrastructure like bike carriers and repurpose snow making systems into irrigation systems that water biking trails. "Good dirt is like good snow," Mr. McSkimming says.
4. Dry Slopes
Mr. Snow, a German startup, sells a carpetlike faux ski hill that rolls out like a mat and has an arrangement of loops on the surface that reproduces gliding sensations, says Jens Reindl, one of the company's founders. Mr. Reindl says the product is beginner-friendly and could become popular in low-altitude ski resorts near urban centers. The mat, which is available for sale in the U.S., comes in modular 65-by-6.5-foot patches and costs $120 for every 10 square feet.
5. Doing More With Less
In the future, it may take skiers more twists and turns to reach the bottom of the slope as ski operators seek to have more people use the same patches of snow, says Joe Hession, the majority owner of Mountain Creek Resort in New Jersey. Moving snow blocks to create more jumps, rails, gradual hills and big turns could allow resorts to focus their snow-making capacity on selected segments and do more with less terrain, he says.
6. More Efficient Snow Guns
Temperature increases mean ski resorts will have shrinking windows of cold weather to produce artificial snow, says Brian Fairbank, chairman of the Fairbank Group, which operates three ski resorts in the Northeastern U.S. More efficient, cheaper snow guns that pump out more snow could help make up for this change. One recent innovation is the "Sledgehammer," a $3,150 snow gun developed by Fairbank that it says converts twice as much water into snow per hour as traditional machines and performs better at higher temperatures for about half the price.
7. Smart Snow-Grooming
Today, snowcat operators drive vehicles equipped with sensors, GPS receivers and tablets to visualize snow depth and distribute fresh snowpack. Mr. Hession sees a day when driverless snowcats wirelessly feed terrain data to automated snow guns that pump out snow on shallow spots more accurately. The ski industry might need to hire more highly skilled and higher paid employees to manage these remote systems, he says.
8. Green-Powered Resorts
Ski resorts could increasingly turn to green infrastructure like solar panels and wind turbines with the goal to operate 100% on renewable power and diminish their own carbon footprints. Wolf Creek Ski Area in Colorado purchases most of its electricity from green sources year-round, including a 25-acre off-site solar farm. Mountain Creek Resort relies on goats to mow the grass on the slopes in the summer rather than use fuel-intensive machinery. More operators are expected to adopt renewable energy in the future, says Adrienne Saia Isaac, the director of marketing and communications at the National Ski Areas Association, an industry group. "We as an industry can't simply rely on pivoting to summer business as a climate change solution," she says.
9. Making Snow When It's Not Freezing
The Italian startup Nevexn has developed Snow4Ever Thermal, a container-size chiller that freezes water to make up to 1,700 cubic feet of snow a day, almost enough to cover a tennis court with a foot of snow, at above-freezing temperatures. The machine uses solar thermal energy and energy from burning biomass such as wood pellets. The company developed the system with a $2.1 million grant from the European Union and tested it in the Italian Dolomites last year, says Francesco Besana, a co-founder. It plans to commercialize it in the coming years.
10. From Ski Resorts to Entertainment Resorts
Ziplines, climbing walls, water attractions and mountain roller coasters could be increasingly offered year-round as resorts endeavor to be less reliant on winter sports. This shift could come with a new focus on immersive educational experiences like night walks and light shows that introduce visitors to a mountain's geological history, says Mr. McSkimming of Select Contracts.
11. Indoor Skiing
Indoor ski areas could make up for seasonal variations and provide access to new markets in urban areas, says Dr. Natalie Ooi, the director of tourism enterprise programs at Colorado State University. Big Snow American Dream, the country's first indoor ski area, opened in New Jersey in 2019 and could provide a blueprint for future investments. It boasts a 4-acre skiable area that operates at 28 degrees Fahrenheit and has a 160-foot vertical drop, four lifts and snow guns.
12. Passes, Passes, Passes
Customers could get much better deals by pre-buying season passes to access more resorts, including internationally, as the industry moves to insulate revenues from weather variations, says David Perry, an executive vice president at Alterra Mountain Co., the ski-resort giant. He anticipates passes will represent 60-70% of Alterra's ticket sales in the coming years, up from 40-50% today. Resorts could also start selling megapasses valid both in summer and winter, says Auden Schendler, a senior vice president in charge of sustainability at Aspen Skiing Co.

Full text: MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador became an unlikely ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump's migration policies, deploying thousands of soldiers across Mexico to stop Central American asylum seekers heading toward the 2,000-mile border.
Now, President Biden is preparing to undo much of Mr. Trump's immigration legacy, while facing differences with the Mexican populist over other bilateral issues such as security cooperation and climate change.
Cooperation with the Mexican president will be crucial to managing the immigration issue, say political and policy analysts. Mr. Biden has pledged an immigration overhaul to provide a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented migrants, nearly half of them Mexicans.
He also wants to end eligibility restrictions for asylum put in place during Mr. Trump's years and terminate a program that required some 70,000 asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their proceedings are adjudicated in the U.S.
The shift in policy, which the administration says will result in a more humane migration system, has a potential downside: If done too hastily, it could spark a surge in migrants, which could prove politically disastrous for Mr. Biden, analysts say.
"They are walking a tightrope on this one," says Andrew Selee of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank. "They understand they have to signal they are doing things differently, but they need to be cautious about what they are doing in the border so as not to risk sparking a huge surge."
In November and December, the flow of migrants increased along some parts of the border, driven partly by hopes that the new U.S. administration would allow them entry, according to analysts.
Worried about a stampede, U.S. officials have been telling migrants to stay home. "This is not the time to come to the United States," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. "We need the time to put in place an immigration process so people can be treated humanely."
The risks of a migrant surge were on display days before Mr. Biden's inauguration when a large caravan of some 9,000 migrants was heading from Honduras through Guatemala to the U.S. border. Guatemala mobilized thousands of soldiers that turned the caravan back. Mexico marshaled troops as backup.
Mr. Selee said the Trump administration changed the way regional governments, including Mexico, see uncontrolled migration movements, as exemplified by large caravans of migrants. Now, Mexico and other governments are much more willing to recognize such movements as a problem.
"The governments in the region understand that it's in no one's interest to allow a surge of people across the border," he said.
Both Mexico and Guatemala say they are willing to keep up the tough law-enforcement approach until the Biden administration implements its policies.
"Mexico's deployment of the National Guard won't change in the foreseeable future . . . all the three countries agree that we don't want a migratory crisis and that changes have to happen in a gradual and orderly manner," said Roberto Velasco, the general director for northern America at Mexico's foreign ministry.
The cooperation on migration is emerging as a rare point of strength in the relationship between Mexico's nationalist leader and the new U.S. president. Both men agree on the need for a long-term development plan for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where most asylum seekers come from, fleeing poverty and violence. Mr. Biden has committed to investing $4 billion in the region.
There are other issues that will complicate the relationship. One significant area of policy differences is fighting climate change, which Mr. Biden has put at the centerpiece of his administration's goals.
In contrast, Mr. Lopez Obrador is building an $8 billion refinery while he funnels more money to inefficient state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos. He has implemented a series of regulatory changes that effectively block the development of renewable energy projects, and is undoing key parts of the 2013 energy reform that opened the oil and electricity industries to private investors, many of them American.
Experts warn some of the changes in the energy sector could violate Mexico's trade deal with the U.S. and Canada.
"What we are going to see is an increasing number of conflicts in a myriad of issues, from energy to climate change and environment," said Carlos Elizondo, a political-science professor at Tecnologico de Monterrey university and a former Mexican envoy to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Full text: President Biden's nominee to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers and cattle ranchers are potential leaders in the new administration's battle against climate change.
Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who led the USDA for eight years during the Obama administration, said Tuesday that government-funded incentives could get farmers and agricultural companies to adopt climate-friendly practices without the need for additional regulation, and could make U.S. food more attractive on export markets.
"Farmers are prepared for it and anxious to do it," Mr. Vilsack said during a virtual confirmation hearing before the Senate agriculture committee. "If it's voluntary, and incentive-based, you will see farmers and ranchers cooperate extensively."
The Senate committee voted Tuesday to advance Mr. Vilsack's nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. No date has yet been set for that vote, a committee spokeswoman said.
Proposals to change agricultural practices are one piece of Mr. Biden's push to tackle climate change, which was on display in three executive orders issued last week suspending new oil-and-gas leases on federal land and boosting offshore wind production. Other cabinet nominees have said efforts to address climate change will inform the Biden administration's infrastructure plans, and how it evaluates risks to the financial system.
Mr. Vilsack, 70 years old, is tasked with finding a path for the U.S. agriculture industry to eliminate its climate impact under Mr. Biden's goal for the U.S. economy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Capturing carbon in soil and developing products made from agricultural waste, Mr. Vilsack said, could help reduce agriculture's greenhouse-gas contributions, which the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated make up 10% of the U.S. total.
Such programs, Mr. Vilsack said, could provide new kinds of income to struggling farmers. If confirmed, Mr. Vilsack would resume leadership of the USDA after a yearslong slide in crop prices, brought on by record-breaking harvests and the U.S.-China trade war, which pushed down farmers' incomes and fueled a surge in bankruptcies. Direct federal payments to farmers soared to an estimated $46 billion in 2020, a record.
Some Republican lawmakers warned Mr. Vilsack against overreach that could burden the agriculture industry with higher costs and alienate farmers. "Heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all regulations simply will not work," said Sen. John Boozman, (R., Ark.), noting that farmers in his state already are conserving water and easing soil erosion.
Mr. Vilsack said the USDA may form a farmer advisory group to help steer the agency's carbon mitigation efforts. The USDA could encourage capturing methane emitted by livestock operations, Mr. Vilsack said, and research how to boost crops' root systems to maximize carbon conversion.
The USDA, he said, could provide incentives for farmers to reduce tillage of soil that can release carbon into the atmosphere, and keep vegetation growing on fields nearly year-round to withdraw more carbon from the atmosphere. Agriculture companies, including Bayer AG, Nutrien Ltd. and Indigo Ag Inc., are developing platforms that allow farms to register and sell carbon credits generated by such practices.
To fund those efforts, Mr. Vilsack said he would seek to use a Depression-era program called the Commodity Credit Corp. The CCC, which permits borrowing of as much as $30 billion from the Treasury to finance its activities, has long been used to fund farm programs.
Congress had restricted use of the CCC during Mr. Vilsack's previous tenure, but those restrictions were lifted during the Trump administration, helping then-Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue make billions of dollars of payments to farmers to help cushion the blow from trade disputes and the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr. Vilsack said producing agricultural goods more sustainably would give U.S. farmers a competitive edge among global consumers hungry for food that is safe, tasteful, affordable and raised using methods that don't harm the environment.
The pandemic showed the need for a more robust food supply chain, Mr. Vilsack said, promoting a system that includes more, smaller facilities for slaughtering and processing livestock. Covid-19's rapid spread last spring forced some of the country's biggest beef and pork processing plants to temporarily shut down, driving prices down for farmers, backing up livestock on farms and leading some to be euthanized.

Full text: A billionaire hedge-fund manager is bankrolling an unprecedented campaign to force dozens of the world's largest companies to publish carbon-emission reduction plans and put them up for shareholder vote.
Frustrated by the pace at which corporations are cutting emissions, Christopher Hohn is backing a global effort to speed things up. He is working with nonprofit groups and investor organizations to get at least 100 of the companies in the S&P 500 stock index to adopt the initiative by the end of 2022 -- voluntarily if possible and through proxy battles at annual shareholder meetings if not.
"There will be resistance from some companies but I'm willing to put it to the vote," said Mr. Hohn, who has used shareholder activism to make his firm, TCI Fund Management Ltd. one of the most profitable hedge funds in the world.
TCI has filed shareholder resolutions on the issue with Google owner Alphabet Inc. and Charter Communications Inc., among others. Railroad operator Union Pacific Corp., energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp. and online travel behemoth Booking Holdings have all received shareholder resolutions backing the policy in recent weeks from a nonprofit group aligned with Mr. Hohn. Similar drives are under way in Europe and Australia.
Union Pacific is discussing the initiative, called Say on Climate, with its shareholders and has invested in several environmental, social and governance areas, a spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman for Charter declined to comment. Alphabet, Booking and Monster Energy didn't respond to requests for comment.
The success of these proxy fights will depend on the response of much bigger money managers, like BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group, which can often single-handedly swing a vote. The firms are the biggest shareholders of Alphabet, Union Pacific and Booking, and among the largest of Charter and Monster Beverage, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Mr. Hohn has publicly chastised the investing giants for what he calls their "appalling" environmental voting records in the past, but in private he is courting them to support this new initiative.
Mr. Hohn might seem an unlikely environmental crusader. He is better known for fighting management of companies like ABN Amro Bank Holding, the London Stock Exchange Group PLC and Wirecard AG to boost his investment returns.
But the hedge-fund manager has been a leading philanthropist for two decades, and in recent years his $6 billion charitable foundation, the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, has focused more on climate change. Now he is proselytizing on the issue in financial markets, using a combination of public shaming, cajoling and boardroom brawling to get other investors and the companies they own to join his campaign.
"As shareholders, we can't wait on regulators to solve this," Mr. Hohn said. "It's on investors to show how seriously they treat this threat."
Mr. Hohn used his own brand of engagement with Moody's Investors Service, of which TCI owns 3.5%, sending the company's chief executive a letter criticizing the low score it had received on climate disclosure from CDP. The credit-rating firm adopted Say on Climate voluntarily in December, becoming the first U.S. company to do so.
"Our score at the time was a D, which TCI said was unacceptable," said Mark Kaye, chief financial officer at Moody's. "But our score this January was an A. Say on Climate helps signal the level of seriousness with which we want climate to be treated."
For less responsive companies, Mr. Hohn is putting forward shareholder resolutions and marshaling nonprofits to do the same, then lobbying big asset managers to vote in favor of them.
BlackRock reviews every shareholder resolution on its own merits and won't give wholesale support to the campaign, said Sandy Boss, who joined the firm in April to run its shareholder interactions. Still, the initiative aligns with a shift that began at BlackRock in July to vote more aggressively on climate-related shareholder resolutions. The firm supported eight out of nine environmental proposals in the second half of 2020, according to a BlackRock report. Chief Executive Larry Fink emphasized the new approach in a public letter this week.
Supporting shareholder resolutions, "was historically a last-resort tool," Ms. Boss said. "Now it's a primary tool."
Mr. Hohn spoke personally to Ms. Boss last autumn to garner her support for his first Say on Climate proxy fight against Spanish airport operator Aena SA, a company of which he was a shareholder, and BlackRock voted in favor of the resolution. Aena's management initially recommended shareholders oppose the measure before changing tack after it became clear that a majority of investors favored it, Mr. Hohn said.
Aena disagreed with certain details of Mr. Hohn's proposal, a company spokeswoman said. "We managed to overcome them and reach an agreement, which is an excellent example of Aena's strong commitment to the environment."

U.S. Finds Climate
Is Risk to Economy
An advisory panel to the top U.S. commodities regulator published a report in September saying that climate change could pose a systemic risk to the U.S. economy, and that delay in responding to it could be devastating. National governments are still in the early stages of understanding how different climate risks interact, according to the report.
U.S. regulators haven't laid down many rules on climate disclosure. Many large companies have advertised environmental initiatives but few commit to concretely reducing emissions. While 90% of companies in the S&P 500 publish annual sustainability reports, only 12% have approved targets to cut carbon emissions that are based on scientific research, according to nonprofit group CDP, which runs an environmental disclosure system for companies and governments.
Some large money managers -- particularly those who champion environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investing -- have been pushing companies to reduce emissions through what they call "engagement." They use public communication and back channels to move management along, but rarely force change through shareholder votes. BlackRock and Vanguard supported less than a fifth of proxy votes on key climate resolutions in 2020, according to data from Morningstar Inc.
"They are owners but they don't act like owners -- they treat management with kid gloves," said Wolfgang Kuhn, a director of ShareAction, a responsible-investment nonprofit. "Their voting behavior is they endorse management almost 100% of the time."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden took a series of steps to address climate change Wednesday, suspending new oil and gas leases on federal land and confronting the issue through diplomatic, conservation and other initiatives.
In three executive orders, Mr. Biden directed the Interior Department to identify steps to double offshore wind production by 2030 and to employ Americans on climate-focused public-works projects.
He also set a goal for delivering 40% of the benefits of all federal spending on climate initiatives to poor and minority communities.
Mr. Biden framed climate change as a matter of national security and directed all major government departments to take action aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and the country's decadeslong reliance on oil.
"In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer. We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones and it's time to act," Mr. Biden said.
Mr. Biden's actions Wednesday, which followed an order last week for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris climate accord, is putting more pressure on fault lines in the business community that divide the allies of renewable power and fossil fuels.
Many, especially technology and retail companies, have been pushing for more support for clean-tech companies like renewable-power developers and battery makers as a way to ensure the future of the U.S. economy.
"Biden's policies are going to drive economic recovery for more Americans (and) grow jobs and business that have been driven out of the economy in 2020," said Michael Garland, chief executive of wind-farm developer Pattern Energy Group Inc. "Without these efforts, the U.S. will be a secondary player to China, which would be a disaster for American jobs and manufacturing," Mr. Garland said.
But the order is causing friction with the oil industry, which sees a threat to its future and massive job losses in Mr. Biden's initiatives.
Western oil-producing states could be especially hard-hit by Mr. Biden's order to suspend new leasing on federal land, Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.) said Wednesday.
"Energy producers will simply go elsewhere -- likely out of state or overseas," Mr. Barrasso said in a statement before the confirmation hearing of Mr. Biden's nominee for energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm. "The president's order will deprive thousands of people in Wyoming of their jobs and a principal source of revenue for public education and other essential services."
The Interior Department said Mr. Biden's order to suspend new oil and gas leases on federal land pending a review won't affect current drilling operations, and that the oil industry still has access to millions of acres.
The consulting firm Rystad Energy has said that will prevent the industry from feeling big effects for several years, time the Biden administration says it wants to use to foster employment in cleaner businesses.
That has some of oil's traditional allies publicly taking sides with Mr. Biden. The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association for investor-owned utilities, lauded Mr. Biden's moves Wednesday, saying they are likely to boost demand from electric-vehicle drivers and utilities' access to clean power.
Some auto makers also say the moves will help support their efforts to electrify.
"It's a nice little tailwind to get corporate strategy matching government strategy," said Scott Keogh, chief executive for the U.S. subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, which is investing $800 million to build a new electric model at its plant in Tennessee.
Mr. Biden signed the orders after a press briefing that featured former Secretary of State John Kerry -- the president's special envoy for climate change -- and former Obama Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy.
"We can achieve things in the course of the next four years that move the marketplace, the private sector, global finance, innovation and research," Mr. Kerry said.
One of the orders officially establishes the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, which Ms. McCarthy will lead. Mr. Kerry's position is also new.
Ms. Granholm, at her Senate hearing, repeatedly emphasized how climate change would be a priority at the department under her leadership.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The oil industry is emerging as a primary target of President Biden's climate policy, setting the stage for a confrontation that could shape the future of the energy sector.
The president is expected to issue an executive order Wednesday that would suspend new oil and gas leasing on federal land, people familiar with the matter say, in what is widely seen as a first step toward fulfilling Mr. Biden's campaign pledge to stop drilling on federal lands and offshore.
Drilling on federal lands accounts for roughly 9% of U.S. onshore production, but oil industry leaders see a curtailment on future development as a significant threat. Oil companies want to maximize their access to land and federal permits to help grow and sustain operations, and they plan to resist Mr. Biden's efforts through lawsuits and lobbying Congress.
"The early actions of the administration are unilaterally shutting down and restricting the ability of American oil and gas producers to run their operations," said Anne Bradbury, chief executive of the American Exploration and Production Council, which represents independent U.S. oil companies. "The scope and the lack of consultation with industry stakeholders has been alarming."
In addition to a possible ban on new leases, Mr. Biden issued orders on his first day in office last week for a wide-ranging review of policies that former President Donald Trump had intended to ease restrictions on oil and other industry.
Mr. Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada and moved to stop oil companies from drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. No drilling has yet begun there, but the Trump administration had auctioned leases in the refuge earlier this month.
As a candidate, Mr. Biden had said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces, and that he would push the country to "transition away from the oil industry." Through gasoline burned by cars and trucks, oil in recent years has become the country's top source of the greenhouse-gas emissions that warm the planet, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.
Many of his actions have been expected, but the administration's speed and willingness to target the industry have surprised its leaders and analysts. Share prices of U.S. oil companies tumbled in the week since these moves, stinging the industry at a time when it already faces existential questions from low prices and growing competition from cleaner sources of energy.
Mr. Biden has been under pressure from environmentalists to take aggressive action, citing the oil industry's role in contributing to climate change. They are cheering Mr. Biden's steps as a long-overdue shift to cleaner forms of energy.
"The temporary halt on new oil and gas leases is critical," said Natalie Mebane, associate director of policy at 350.org, an advocacy group that wants to limit oil production. She called the orders an "important step to protecting our communities, lands, and waters, halting corporate pollution and giveaways to fossil fuel CEOs."
Industry leaders say that is unfairly punitive and risky. Keystone XL's developers laid off 1,000 workers immediately upon Mr. Biden's move last week, and tens of thousands more could follow if oil companies can't keep drilling on federal territory. Industry leaders also say the moves endanger progress on emissions, which have fallen dramatically in the U.S. in recent years in part from a drilling boom that allowed power producers to burn more gas instead of coal.
Mr. Biden has promised to help laid off workers through promoting cleaner sources of energy. His climate plan includes $2 trillion in spending -- grants, loans and tax incentives that would need to be approved by Congress -- to help wind- and solar-power developers, battery makers and the electric-vehicle businesses that Mr. Biden says can employ more people in the future.
In addition to the moratorium on oil and gas leasing, Mr. Biden on Wednesday is expected to set a goal of protecting 30% of federal land and water by 2030, the people said. The president is also planning to re-establish a White House council of science advisers created during the Obama administration. Mr. Biden's plans were earlier reported by Bloomberg News and others.
The expected executive order Wednesday to freeze new oil and gas leasing builds on actions Mr. Biden took during his first day in office. He put a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, reversing congressional action taken in 2017 to begin leasing in the area.
The Interior Department subsequently issued an order suspending all onshore and offshore fossil fuel-related authorizations for 60 days unless they are approved by the department's senior leadership.

Full text: BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Larry Fink asked companies to disclose more information on how they were moving to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, stepping up the company's environmental efforts from a few years ago.
Mr. Fink said he was focused on the issue because of the risk climate change poses on investor returns, as well as potential policy pressures. He urged companies to make clear how they were preparing for a global regime focused on "net zero" goals to emit no more carbon dioxide than it removes from the atmosphere by 2050, a priority in line with the Paris climate accord.
One of President Biden's first acts in office was getting the U.S. to rejoin the climate accord, signaling the administration's heightened focus on companies' carbon footprint. Some regulators said that climate risks' effects on the financial system need to be better understood.
"Better sustainability disclosures are in companies' as well as investors' own interests," Mr. Fink said in a letter released to chief executive officers of companies on Tuesday. "I urge companies to move quickly to issue them rather than waiting for regulators to impose them."
The company told clients it would flag companies that posed significant climate risk for potential selling from its actively managed portfolios. BlackRock also planned to publish the proportion of its assets "aligned to net zero" and goals on that metric going forward.
Best known for funds that trade on exchanges and mirror markets, BlackRock is the world's largest money manager with $8.7 trillion in assets. The company has a high profile perch as a corporate watchdog, but BlackRock can't just sell out of specific companies at will when investors task it to track indexes. It has to turn to other ways to nudge companies.
Mr. Fink's letter is one way for BlackRock to try to amplify its voice as a shareholder for companies the firm's funds invest in.
He has become a flag-bearer of the idea that companies can't sustain profits unless they can account for the needs of workers, the public and society at large.
The idea is now a popular mantra. In a sign of the times, business leaders are increasingly emboldened to use their perch atop major companies to weigh in on social issues.
Some companies have complained Mr. Fink is overreaching and sermonizing.
BlackRock attracted criticism from environmental advocates who want BlackRock to go further to advance green causes. The company has been criticized by activists for being soft on management and not supporting enough shareholder proposals that could spur change. In late 2020, BlackRock signaled it would be more willing to consider voting in favor of shareholder proposals that address material business risks.
"No issue ranks higher than climate change on our clients' lists of priorities. They ask us about it nearly every day," Mr. Fink said in his letter this week.
Each year, Mr. Fink writes a letter to other chief executives, often timedto go public around World Economic Forum annual gatherings.
The letters dovetail with a business priority: building its brand around encouraging more corporate disclosure on environmental and social issues.
The company has been expanding its line up of funds branded around sustainability and aggressively looking to capture market share in a lucrative, growing part of the investment industry.
BlackRock aims to grow the roughly $200 billion it manages today in sustainability-themed strategies to $1 trillion by 2030. The company has been adding to technology capabilities to help clients assess investment risks from climate change.
Mr. Fink said the coronavirus pandemic presented an existential crisis that would prompt more to consider how climate change would alter lives.
A world energy transition that protects livelihoods "can only be accomplished with leadership, coordination, and support at every level of government, working in partnership with the private sector to maximize prosperity," Mr. Fink added.

Full text: Some of Europe's largest banks are phasing out trading services for the export of oil from the Ecuadorean Amazon, a move that reflects the growing focus of global banks on climate change and their shift away from increasingly risky fossil fuels.
On Monday, Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group AG and Holland's ING Groep NV said they were excluding new transactions related to exports of Ecuador's Amazonian oil from their trading activities, citing climate change and concerns for the Amazon rainforest and its indigenous people.
France's BNP Paribas SA, the largest bank in the eurozone and one of the region's trading powerhouses, said in December that it would immediately exclude from its trading activities the seaborne exports of oil from the Esmeraldas region in Ecuador under its latest environmental finance policies.
Ecuador isn't one of the world's top oil producers, but petroleum exports are a key contributor to the country's economy. Petroecuador, the nation's state-owned oil company, didn't respond to requests for comment.
The banks' flight from Amazonian crude follows last year's crash in oil prices and growing fears of so-called stranded assets, which are fossil fuels that lose value due to the world's transition to cleaner forms of energy. In December, Credit Suisse said its lending to the oil-and-gas industry fell to $6.9 billion in the third quarter of 2020 from $7.7 billion in the first quarter.
"Assessing the environmental and climate change risks of funding a particular project is becoming a key legal notion for the banking sector and trade financing operations," said Monica Feria-Tinta, a lawyer at London-based firm Twenty Essex.
As those risks mount, more European investors are turning away from fossil fuels.
"We have divested from all the top oil majors because not only are they major greenhouse gas emitters, they also carry risks for devastating spills and other negative social and environmental impacts," said Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at the $20 billion Danish pension fund AkademikerPension.
Banks are also facing calls from environmentalists and indigenous peoples to limit their involvement in fossil fuels. In Ecuador, a campaign by activists and indigenous people spurred ING and Credit Suisse to reduce their exposure to the Amazonian oil trade. The nonprofits Stand.earth and Amazon Watch published a report last year that called out banks -- including ING, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas -- for their financing of Amazonian crude.
"The banks identified in our report faced serious allegations of double standards for making climate pledges while continuing to finance the trade of Amazon oil," said Moira Birss, climate and finance director at Amazon Watch.
She said the new commitments from the banks are a positive step toward strengthening protection of the Amazon rainforest and respect for indigenous rights in the region.
A spokesman for ING said the lender shared many of the concerns in the report, which is why it is reviewing its exposure to the oil and gas trade flowing from the Ecuadorean Amazon. "In the meantime, we have decided not to engage in any new contracts for the financing of oil and gas trade flows," from the region he said.

Full text: From Antarctica to the Arctic, the world's ice is melting faster than ever, according to a new global satellite survey that calculated the amount of ice lost from a generation of rising temperatures.
Between 1994 and 2017, the Earth lost 28 trillion metric tons of ice, the survey showed. That is an amount roughly equivalent to a sheet of ice 100 meters thick covering the state of Michigan or the entire U.K. -- and the meltwater from so much ice loss has raised the sea level just over an inch or so world-wide, the scientists said.
"It's such a huge amount it's hard to imagine it," said Thomas Slater, a research fellow at the U.K.'s University of Leeds Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling and the lead author of a paper describing the new research. "Ice plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate, and losses will increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as flooding, fires, storm surges and heat waves."
The paper was published in the European Geophysical Union's journal the Cryosphere.
Adding up the loss from glaciers, ice shelves, polar ice caps and sea ice, Dr. Slater and his colleagues determined that the rate of global melting has accelerated 65% since the 1990s.
The ice loss has grown from 0.8 trillion tons a year to 1.3 trillion tons a year, driven by rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures resulting from greenhouse gas emissions, the scientists said. Slightly more than half the ice loss occurred in the Northern Hemisphere.
Dr. Slater and a team of eight other scientists from the University of Edinburgh, University College London and an Edinburgh-based climate data company called Earth Wave Ltd. based their findings on 50 studies of ice loss, field measurements and data from 17 satellite missions.
The researchers employed techniques to reach their conclusions. These included the use of satellite altimeters and gravity sensors to measure the volume and mass of ice on the ground below. They also used satellite imagery to detect changes over the years.
"It's a reminder that dangerous climate change is already here, in this case in the form of melting ice, rising sea level and the inundation of our coastlines," said Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climatologist and author of "The New Climate War." He wasn't involved in the research.
The U.S. moved last week to rejoin the Paris Agreement, an international climate accord designed to limit greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 and keep the rise in global temperature to no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), compared with preindustrial levels.
The average global temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1880s, when systematic record-keeping began, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Last week, NASA and the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service announced that Earth's average global surface temperature in 2020 tied 2016 as the warmest year on record.
Independent studies by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a private climate-analysis group called Berkeley Earth found that 2020 was slightly colder than 2016 but warmer than every other year since 1850.

Full text: Since 2003, Governors Island, has been transformed from a former military base into a summer recreational oasis. However, the next phase of the island's development and rezoning is facing resistance.
The Trust for Governors Island -- a city-controlled nonprofit that runs the 172-acre island in New York Harbor -- is working with the mayor's office on a new plan for the area's long-debated next phase: A climate-research center within 4.5 million square feet of new development on the southern part of the island, which currently is mostly open green space.
"Having a bold vision like this is what we believe will unlock the potential of the island," said Clare Newman, president and chief executive of the trust.
The plan for redevelopment, which is part of a rezoning proposal that allows for hotels, offices and buildings more than 300 feet high, faces community opposition from some New York City residents concerned it would forever alter what the trust has already achieved -- beloved and needed green space in a unique, bucolic setting, with man-made hills and historic buildings.
The proposal, certified by the Department of City Planning in October, is making its way through the city's land-use approval process, which usually takes several months, and could be voted on by City Hall in the spring.
Development plans for the island have been floated before: A global health center, a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed hotel and water park, a university campus and, from the mayor's office in 2016, an "innovation cluster" for fostering tech entrepreneurship. But none have panned out.
The idea for developing two waterfront parcels on the southern part of the island, totaling 33 acres, is to create a global climate-research hub, Ms. Newman said, making New York a world leader on climate issues.
It also would help the island achieve two of its long-term goals that include turning it into a year-round location and giving it the means to financially support itself. Now the island, which attracted about one million visitors in 2019, is only open from May to October, and 75% of its $20 million budget comes from New York City.
The city aims to join with a university or research center and create labs, research facilities, dorms, faculty housing, conference centers and other spaces focused on climate change.
The island, which is in a flood zone, could be uniquely positioned to deal with the challenges of climate change, Ms. Newman said. The trust estimates the center would also create 8,000 jobs and generate needed funds for a city reeling from the effects of the global Covid-19 pandemic.
The northern part of the island, largely designated a historic district, was rezoned to allow for commercial uses in 2013. The island's few permanent residents, including a maritime-focused high school, an arts center and climate museum, reside on the northern half of the island, which also has two historic military forts.
A day spa is also being built there. The hope is that the southern rezoning would help attract more tenants to the historic buildings as the island becomes more fully used, Ms. Newman said.
For many, it isn't the idea of a climate center that has been controversial, it is the scope of the development.
Last month, Manhattan's Community Board 1, the advisory board for lower Manhattan, voted against the rezoning plan, with conditions, after scores of people voiced opposition to the development's scale. The board's role is advisory in the proposal's approval process.
The rezoning also would allow for offices, hotels and retail, as well as 200-person capacity restaurants, on the island's open space. The tallest building on the island now is about 120 feet, but with the rezoning, buildings could be as high as 350 feet to 370 feet.
A big concern is that the city's plan for a climate center is just aspirational right now, so it isn't clear what exactly would be built. But the rezoning, if passed, is forever, said Laura Starr, a landscape architect and member of Community Board 1.
The deed to the island prevents certain uses, such as permanent housing or casinos, but the deed expires in 2060.
"There are no definite plans, and there is no university or research partner yet," Ms. Starr said. She has raised concerns that the rezoning plan could "alter the whole ethos of the island" with tall office buildings, a la the Financial District in lower Manhattan.
Ms. Newman said the trust takes "concerns very seriously and we have committed to looking at ways to reduce bulk and height" of the development.
There is support for the plan, too. Merritt Birnbaum, the executive director of the Friends of Governors Island, a nonprofit formed in 1995 to help ensure that the island would be used to serve the public when the Coast Guard left the island the following year, said the proposal would expand on the island's use as a treasured public amenity.
"The proposed rezoning will create a year-round environment where more people can discover and enjoy the island, including increased ferry service and expanded opportunities for recreation, education and the arts" Ms. Birnbaum said at a recent CB1 meeting.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Keystone oil pipeline's developer plans to announce a series of overhauls -- including a pledge to use only renewable energy -- in a bid to win President-elect Joe Biden's support for the controversial project.
Aides to Mr. Biden have previously said he plans to revoke the permit, and Canada's CBC News reported late Sunday that Mr. Biden plans to do so in one of his first actions after taking office this week.
Mr. Biden's team declined to discuss that report, but has said his position on the pipeline hasn't changed.
In a bid to save the project, Canada's TC Energy Corp. is committing to spend $1.7 billion on solar, wind and battery power to operate the partially completed 2,000-mile pipeline system between Alberta, in western Canada, and Texas, company officials say. They also are pledging to hire a union workforce and eliminate all greenhouse-gas emissions from operations by 2030.
The company's plans reflect new realities at a time when Democrats are taking commanding positions in Washington, and in an era of growing environmental and social concerns.
"In our view, this is the most sustainable and environmentally friendly pipeline project that has ever been built," Richard Prior, president of TC Energy's Keystone XL expansion project, said in an interview. "This is groundbreaking stuff for an energy infrastructure project of the size and scale of Keystone XL."
Construction of the expansion, long delayed by legal and permitting challenges, started last year under a permit President Trump awarded to sidestep an order by a federal judge blocking construction in the U.S., pending a supplemental environmental review.
Keystone executives hope to keep the $8 billion project alive by making it a showcase for how fossil-fuel projects can still be environmentally friendly and generate good-paying union jobs.
In August, the company struck a deal with four labor unions to build the line itself. And it followed that up in mid-November with a deal for five indigenous tribes to take a roughly $785 million ownership stake. A new labor deal led by North America's Building Trades Unions gives priority to union workers for the renewable power buildout, too.
Other pipelines and megaprojects for oil, natural gas and minerals have started dying under pressure from financiers and environmental activists troubled by climate change and safety risks.
The promises by TC Energy present an early test to Mr. Biden's intentions. During his campaign, Mr. Biden joined with the progressive Democrats calling for a transition away from oil to address climate-change concerns, more support for labor unions and better protection from pollution for minority and poor communities.
Mr. Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, could face questions on the pipeline at his confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The U.S. State Department issues the project's presidential permit.
Canadian government officials continue to press the case for Keystone with Mr. Biden's team. They want to get more bottlenecked Canadian crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast, one of the world's biggest centers for refining oil. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mentioned the pipeline among his top priorities during his first call with Mr. Biden after the election.
"Not only has the project itself changed significantly since it was first proposed, but Canada's oil sands production has also changed significantly," said Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman. She said Canadian oil emissions per barrel have dropped by almost a third since 2000.
Keystone's initial proposal became a flashpoint for climate activists. It led many to fight pipelines as a way to combat growing oil production and instead push investment to alternative energy projects that wouldn't contribute to climate change.
They especially object to the Keystone pipeline because the Canadian crude it carries comes from oil sands, which generate more pollution than other types of oil.
To address those concerns, Keystone is promising to fund new renewable energy infrastructure to generate 1.6 gigawatts of power. That amount would rival the country's biggest corporate renewables purchases by companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google that have become common in recent years, and further boost a burgeoning wind and solar market.
Some oil producers and refiners, including Keystone's business partners, are moving in the same direction, with efforts to reduce or even eliminate the carbon-dioxide emissions from their operations that contribute to climate change.
Keystone XL is a 1,210-mile expansion to a larger pipeline network. It must connect to the power grid to run pump stations that help push oil through the line. Those stations sit about every 50 miles along the pipelines, driven by electric motors.
Executives are pledging to acquire renewable power for the entire network, a development that may take until 2030 to finish. Until then the company plans to buy credits funding emissions-reduction projects to offset all the emissions caused by their operations.
Union leaders, many of whom endorsed Mr. Biden, have made it clear they are willing to push back if Mr. Biden rejects these types of projects. The oil industry has a long history of solid wages and commitment to union workers, which labor leaders trust more than the new wind and solar companies that have yet to build the same track record, said Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- When President-elect Joe Biden's advisers wrote his climate plan, they often had one small audience in mind: the U.S. Senate.
That chamber has been reluctant to forcefully address climate issues with major new laws, but expectations are growing after election victories in Georgia Jan. 5 gave Democrats Senate control. The shift has made infrastructure funding for cleaner energy a realistic possibility and offers a likely kick-start for Mr. Biden's ambitious agenda.
The Democratic control is still narrow -- both parties have 50 Senate seats and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaks ties -- and that is likely to limit how far Mr. Biden and fellow Democrats can reach. But the Biden team has tailored some of its plans for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to benefit auto makers, oil and gas producers, and utilities, an appeal to moderate Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate needed to pass legislation.
Mr. Biden, as a candidate, had called for $2 trillion in spending on projects to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions that most scientists implicate in climate change.
Democrats have rallied behind consensus studies that call for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions in half by 2030 and effectively ending them by roughly 2050 to avoid catastrophic consequences. But many consider it politically unpalatable to respond with new taxes or regulatory powers that might hurt industry. That leaves government investment through direct spending, loans and tax breaks as the most popular ideas.
The Democrats' control of Congress is probably too tenuous to get $2 trillion approved, but congressional staff, advisers to Mr. Biden and analysts expect hundreds of billions are still possible.
Mr. Biden seeks to reimagine environmental policy as a jobs program, spending on clean energy to spur growth.
His plans target the Senate in several other ways. Notably, they adopt a proposal to revive the cash-for-clunkers program to fund subsidies for lower-emissions cars. This version is devoted to electric vehicles, giving rebates or vouchers to buy them when consumers trade in a gasoline-powered vehicle.
The Biden plan promised to support 250,000 new jobs by paying to cap leaky, abandoned oil and gas wells and clean up abandoned mines. Mr. Biden's advisers saw that as a draw to moderates and Republican senators in oil and gas states like New Mexico, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Colorado, stopping emissions while also supporting oil, gas and mining companies.
The Biden team has promised 500,000 new charging stations for electric vehicles. It is also a boon to electric utilities eager to boost demand from electric vehicles.
"Auto makers have been pushing harder for accelerated EV deployment for some time and recently they've been joined by electric utilities and even some oil interests," said Christopher Guith, who oversees policy for an energy arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Together with the environmental groups, that is a formidable coalition."
Democrats will still need Republican support to reach a 60-vote threshold necessary to pass most legislation in the Senate. But with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) as majority leader likely to bring more votes to the floor than current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), there is a growing belief that some Republicans will emerge to help pass at least limited infrastructure spending increases.
The American Petroleum Institute, one of the industry's largest trade groups, used its annual "State of American Energy" address last week to challenge the Democrats' strategy. The group's leader, Mike Sommers, said it wants to work with Mr. Biden on emissions limits and trade policy, but said more taxes and regulations could hurt consumers and workers. "Mandates get us nowhere," Mr. Sommers said.

Full text: Companies are bracing for further regulation under the incoming Biden administration. One area that could affect a number of industries: potential new requirements related to diversity, carbon emissions and other sustainability metrics.
President-elect Joe Biden campaigned on requiring companies to provide more detail on environmental risks and greenhouse-gas emissions as part of a broader agenda to combat climate change. He laid out a multipronged plan to address longstanding racial inequality. And he has said he would hold corporate executives personally accountable, including jail time where merited, for violations such as corporate pollution that affect the health and safety of workers and surrounding communities.
Jon Hale, head of sustainability research at Morningstar, says any moves by the Biden administration would follow calls from many others seeking environmental, social and governance, or ESG, regulations.
"It's not just investors demanding it; all other stakeholders -- workers, customers, clients, the communities you operate in -- they are expecting a higher standard from companies in the way that they operate," he says. "In virtually every industry, there's a unique set of ESG issues that are material to that industry."
Businesses and trade groups have been requesting meetings with Mr. Biden's agency review teams and incoming staff to build relationships, get clarity on expected policies and make pitches for potential rules, according to Biden transition officials, executives and trade groups. So far, the Biden team has been listening and asking questions, the transition officials say.
One of the biggest areas to be addressed is disclosure. Under the Trump administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission stymied calls for tighter environmental, social and governance rules.
Currently, public companies must disclose ESG information only if they deem it material to investors' perception of the business. Even though a number of trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have put out voluntary sustainability-disclosure guidelines in recent years, companies often don't disclose ESG data in their financial statements. And the information in voluntary sustainability reports may be inconsistent or incomplete, since companies may report metrics only where they perform well.
Mr. Biden on Monday named Gary Gensler, a former financial regulator and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, as his SEC pick. Although Mr. Gensler hasn't outlined his priorities, Mr. Hale expects the SEC to require public companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and greenhouse-gas emissions in their operations and supply chains, since the SEC will have a three-to-two Democratic majority.
SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, a Democrat, wrote in August that the SEC should "get investors the standardized, consistent, reliable, and comparable ESG disclosures they need to protect their investments and allocate capital toward a sustainable economy."
"Companies' disclosure of the potential financial impact of climate change on strategy and operations is still limited," says Mary Schapiro, a former SEC chairwoman. "Markets need high-quality, comparable information from companies to enable informed capital-allocation decisions in the face of climate-related risk."
Other large changes may be in the works. Under the Trump administration, the regulatory environment took what some describe as anti-ESG stances in some rule-making decisions. For instance, the Labor Department completed a rule in October making it more difficult for funds focused on ESG factors to be included in retirement plans.
Morningstar's Mr. Hale expects the Biden Labor Department to clarify or reverse that rule. Mr. Biden chose Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, who previously led a labor union and the region's Building and Construction Trades Council, as his pick for secretary of labor -- a role that will likely involve dealing with ESG issues around workplace safety amid the continuing pandemic and economic recovery.
Mr. Biden also named Brian Deese, who led sustainable investing at asset-management giant BlackRock, as his top economic adviser. Mr. Deese, who previously focused on climate change and energy issues as a senior adviser to President Obama, is likely to have influence on ESG-related issues.
Some companies and trade groups say if the Biden team moves forward on new rules, they would prefer them to be so-called principles-based and tailored to industries rather than uniform regulations.
For instance, perhaps property and casualty insurers, which are dealing with more frequent storms, would have to consider environmental impact on their business closely, while smaller companies wouldn't have to weigh ESG factors in the same way.
"Our belief is a principles-based approach, rather than a one-size-fits-all rules-based approach, is much better," says Richard McMahon, senior vice president of energy supply and finance at the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned electric companies. "It allows the marketplace to innovate but also to provide information investors are looking for."
Brad Karp, chairman of law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, says that during a recent virtual meeting with about 1,000 corporate leaders who are clients, the talk focused on Mr. Biden's expected push "to make ESG real, concrete and hold corporations accountable."
"It's a virtual certainty that the SEC will follow the European lead and impose enhanced ESG disclosure requirements on public companies," he says.

Full text: Investors are ramping up wagers that the Biden administration's focus on economic stimulus and electric vehicles will turbocharge a monthslong climb in copper and other industrial metals.
Although they slid alongside other commodities Friday, most actively traded copper futures are still up more than 2% so far in 2021 and near their highest level since early 2013. They have been lifted by buoyant demand from China and wagers that an improving global economy will further increase consumption later this year.
Copper and other raw materials such as zinc and aluminum are the building blocks of construction, used to manufacture everything from computers to houses. That makes their prices extremely sensitive to momentum in the global economy and to Chinese growth. China is the world's largest commodity consumer by far, and is responsible for about half of global demand for copper and other metals.
After China largely contained the coronavirus, its economy has motored ahead of the rest of the world, making it a rare bright spot. That has sparked the rally in metals, pushing up copper 25% in the last six months as part of a vast rise in riskier markets.
In another sign of sentiment in metals markets, shares of copper miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc. have more than doubled in the last six months and are already up 17% so far this year. Many analysts look at the performance of mining stocks to gauge sentiment because they are more accessible to many investors than futures contracts, which expire every month and are more complex.
The gains come with investors expecting President-elect Joe Biden to increase stimulus spending to fight the coronavirus and to boost spending on everything from infrastructure to electric-vehicle charging stations. That could fuel more bullish bets on global growth and raw materials, with major European economies expected to employ similar tactics.
"Activity in the U.S. and Europe should strengthen, heavily influenced by fiscal stimulus and an opening up of economies," Bank of America analysts said in a recent note. They raised their 2021 average price targets for copper, aluminum, nickel and zinc, boosting their projection for copper to $3.96 a pound, which would mean a 10% rally from current levels.
Copper fell 1.7% to $3.602 a pound Friday, paring some of its recent advance. A stronger dollar was hurting commodities by making them more expensive for overseas buyers. Still, Bank of America also sees prices averaging $4.31 in the fourth quarter and getting closer to their 2011 record highs.
Another reason investors are piling into the space is that building the number of EV charging stations and green-energy projects needed to meet the world's climate goals will require huge amounts of raw materials in the years ahead.
Mr. Biden has said he wants to incentivize faster adoption of electric cars. As part of a Thursday speech proposing nearly $2 trillion in spending, he said that next month he would outline a second proposal focused on economic recovery that would also use jobs and infrastructure as a tool to combat climate change.
"Given the increased focus on tackling climate change, the focus of government spending will be worth following as decarbonization is bullish metals," the Bank of America analysts said.
Net bets on higher copper prices by hedge funds and speculative investors are near their highest level since early in 2018, Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.
As demand for industrial metals has surged, supply of many remains constrained after years of underinvestment in new mines in response to a yearslong price slump. Additional shutdowns due to the pandemic and sporadic worker strikes in copper-producing nations like Chile are other factors supporting prices.
Many analysts, including those at Jefferies, see copper demand outpacing supply and warn that the situation could get dire for raw materials users more quickly than anticipated.

Full text: Rising temperatures last year capped the world's warmest decade in modern times, federal climate scientists said Thursday.
In a new climate study, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ranked 2020 in adead heat with 2016 as the warmest year since official record-keeping began in 1880. The record-tying warmth came despite a cooling La Nina Pacific Ocean current, which tamped down global temperatures slightly in December.
In a separate assessment released at the same time, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which relies on slightly different temperature records and methods, calculated that the globally averaged temperature last year was the second highest to date -- just 0.04 degrees Fahrenheit shy of tying the record set in 2016.
"These long-term trends are very, very clear," said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. "This is another piece of evidence that tells us the planet is warming decade by decade by decade."
NASA and NOAA scientists labeled 2020 a year of extremes, driven by rising levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat in the atmosphere.
At times last year, the Arctic averaged 12 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, with some spots hitting temperatures of up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Record wildfires in the U.S. and Australia burned millions of acres and spewed smoke plumes high into the stratosphere. There were more named Atlantic storms than ever before. Heat building up in the ocean matched the record set in 2019, the federal scientists said.
The federal research follows independent assessments of 2020 by climate agencies in Europe and Japan.
Reliable climate record-keeping began in 1880. Since then, the annual global temperature has risen at an average rate of 0.14 degree Fahrenheit per decade, the NOAA scientists said. Since 1981, the average rate of increase has been more than twice as high.
"It seems to me that the rate of increase is perhaps accelerating a little bit," said Russell Vose, chief of the analysis and synthesis branch of the National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, N.C., which conducted NOAA's analysis.
The seven warmest years so far all occurred since 2014, the NOAA and NASA scientists said. Taken together, the past decade was the warmest world-wide on record, overtaking a record set by the previous decade, both NOAA and NASA scientists said.
Hundreds of studies and scientific reports have shown that high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are the leading cause of increasing global temperatures, although some dispute those findings.
Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels fell about 7% last year as a result of reduced travel during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Global Carbon project, an international research consortium that tracks emissions world-wide. Even so, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is now higher than at any time in the past 800,000 years, according to the U.K.'s Met Office, which tracks climate change.
In the Northern Hemisphere, last year's averaged land and ocean surface temperature was the highest in the 141-year record, at 2.30 degrees Fahrenheit (1.28 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average, according to NOAA. The annual Southern Hemisphere land and ocean surface temperature was the fifth highest on record.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Gary Gensler, a former financial regulator and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the decision.
Mr. Gensler's nomination would please liberal Democrats who cheered the former regulator's tough approach to rule-making during the Obama administration, when he spearheaded the overhaul of derivatives markets mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and oversaw enforcement actions against investment banks accused of manipulating benchmark interest rates.
The choice of Mr. Gensler, who declined to comment, wasn't final and could still change, the people said.
As head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 2009 to 2014, Mr. Gensler developed a reputation among his colleagues for bare-knuckle tactics as he drove to create a regulatory framework for derivatives, a multi-trillion dollar market that had largely been free from federal oversight. By the time he left the commission, the rule set was largely complete, years before other regulators wrapped up their postcrisis work.
It was a surprising turn for the former Goldman executive who had previously resisted calls for additional derivatives regulation when he served in the Treasury Department under President Clinton. The decision not to tightly regulate derivatives in the 1990s has been blamed for contributing to the financial crisis a decade later.
Mr. Gensler was tapped to lead the CFTC in 2009, as the agency's mission was expanding to address risks to financial stability posed by derivatives, financial instruments including options and futures that are derived from other assets. In that role, Mr. Gensler drew the ire of Wall Street banks as he implemented Dodd Frank.
"He was terrifically effective at the CFTC, he knows the markets as well as anyone on Wall Street, he's a smart and tough regulator who knows how to get things done, and he cares about investor protection," said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America.
Ms. Roper and other progressive groups are hoping the SEC under Mr. Biden will move swiftly to undo policy changes implemented by recently departed Chairman Jay Clayton. Those include curbs on shareholders' ability to propose resolutions at company proxy meetings and efforts to make it easier for private companies to raise capital without registering with the SEC.
Other priorities that a Democratic-led SEC are expected to consider include requiring companies to disclose more information about risks related to climate change and about workforce diversity and political contributions.
"We need a new SEC chair who will put this climate crisis at the top of the agency's agenda," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said during a hearing late last year. She criticized the agency under Mr. Clayton for not mandating that companies disclose aspects of their business that could be affected by climate change or governments efforts to curb it.
The decision to nominate Mr. Gensler was reported earlier by Reuters.
Mr. Gensler occasionally came under criticism for his management of the CFTC, including how his agency oversaw MF Global Inc., the brokerage firm that imploded in 2013 after huge bets it made on European bonds that went south. The CFTC in 2013 sued MF Global and its former chief executive, Jon Corzine, for improperly transferring some customer funds to banks and clearinghouses as it tried to fill margin calls. Mr. Corzine settled the claims in 2017 by paying a $5 million fine.
Mr. Gensler recused himself from the investigation, citing his previous work with Mr. Corzine, a former Democratic senator who also had worked with Mr. Gensler at Goldman Sachs. Senate Republicans said Mr. Gensler's decision to remove himself from the investigation was an effort to sidestep Congress' questions about how the CFTC oversaw Mr. Corzine's firm.
An inspector general's report found that Mr. Gensler had used his personal email while dealing with some MF Global issues while he was away from the CFTC's Washington headquarters.
While Mr. Gensler's candidacy to lead the SEC has been strongly supported by progressives, some worried that he could face an uphill battle to confirmation if the Senate remained under Republican control. Others in the Democratic Party had hoped Mr. Biden would pick a woman or a minority candidate to promote diversity in a sector that remains dominated by white men.
Mr. Gensler's stock rose after Democrats won both runoff elections for the Senate in Georgia on Jan. 6, giving them control of the chamber and smoothing his likely path toward confirmation.
Since the election, Mr. Gensler has overseen a team of volunteers for the Biden transition focused on banking and markets regulators, such as the Federal Reserve and the SEC, as part of an agency review process that occurs with incoming administrations.
Mr. Gensler, 63 years old, also advised Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential runs. Since 2018 he has taught courses on blockchain and digital currencies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.
His profile on the school's website notes that he has completed nine marathons and the JFK 50-mile race in his home state of Maryland, a feat he accomplished in 2007.

Full text: The American Institute of Architects has for years challenged its members to design buildings to combat climate change, setting a goal to hit "net zero" edifices by 2030.
The architects have a ways to go. Last year, 27 of the 19,000 building-design firms owned by AIA members reported meeting their annual mark. That figure was an improvement: 16 firms met targets the year before, and 11 the year before that.
Buildings generate a surprisingly large share of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. About 40% of annual emissions in the U.S. come from heating, lighting, cooling and constructing buildings, according to the AIA.
The architects learned a lesson when trying to meet their green challenge, one that applies broadly to industrywide efforts to address climate change: Customers have to want the products first.
"The architecture profession tends to give what the client asks for, and the vast majority of clients aren't asking" for green structures, said Mike Fowler, a senior associate at Mithun Inc., a Seattle-based architecture firm that was among the few to hit the mark. Mithun always presents at least one energy-efficient design option to clients and works to educate them on climate benefits and potential cost savings, he said.
One thing that can scare away clients is that few contractors have experience on high-performance buildings, and those that do say they can cost 2% to 3% more than regular construction, according to Passive House Institute US Inc.,a nonprofit organization that promotes high-performance buildings.
Architects know how to build very efficient buildings, and use heat pumps and solar panels to reduce net energy consumption, said Christoph Reinhart, director of the Building Technology Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Architecture and Planning.
"We have off-the-shelf technologies to do this," he said. The payback on energy-efficiency investments, such as extra insulation and solar panels, is usually about seven years, longer than most commercial investors are willing to wait, according to building designers and developers.
The AIA began to confront the climate impact of its work more than 15 years ago, after a 2003 cover story in the magazine Metropolis titled "Architects Pollute" triggered a conversation. In 2009, the group adopted what it called a climate challenge to reduce the energy-usage footprint of its new buildings.
Last year, the campaign called for a 70% reduction compared with a 2003 baseline. This year, the reduction ratchets up to 80% and is headed to net-zero buildings -- structures that generate enough power to offset their consumption, usually by adding solar panels -- by 2030.
Though the AIA is far short of meeting those targets, leaders of the group say it has made strides. Last year, more than 310 architecture firms reported energy-use data from more than 20,000 new- and renovated-building projects. Overall, the predicted energy savings were 49% versus the 2003 baseline.
"Change is hard," said Jane Frederick, a South Carolina architect and AIA immediate past president. Ms. Frederick made climate a central issue of her yearlong term. "I'm pleased that we're progressing. I would be happy if we were progressing faster," she said.
In addition to clients, the set-up of most architecture firms emerged as an obstacle. Typically, architects design a building and then bring in mechanical and civil engineers as consultants. Many firms meeting the climate challenge integrate engineering and architecture at the start of the design process.
"That traditional practice, I think, is broken and really can't address the issues that we need to in today's world," said Dan Heinfeld, president of Southern California-based architecture firm LPA Inc.
The AIA said its 2030 challenge has been valuable in creating a library of high-efficiency buildings that others can learn from. The group has also moved into political advocacy, starting in 2018 to urge cities to adopt stricter building codes, including one that would compel new construction to include solar panels and other efficiency measures.
Others are pushing tenants and investors to raise their voices. Lotte Schlegel, executive director of the Institute for Market Transformation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said there are three ways for green building practices to be widely adopted: "Tenants ask for it. Investors ask for it, or regulation requires it."

Agribusiness Firms Spur Farms To Produce Carbon-Offset Credits

Full text: U.S. farmers make their living raising crops from the soil. Now, some are getting paid for putting something back into their fields: carbon.
Big agriculture companies including Bayer AG, Nutrien Ltd. and Cargill Inc. are jockeying with startups to encourage crop producers to adopt climate-friendly practices and develop farming-driven carbon markets. Those efforts would let retailers, food makers and other companies offset their greenhouse-gas emissions by paying farmers for their fields' capacity to withdraw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and trap it in the soil.
The concept envisions the U.S. Midwest's swatches of cropland doing double duty as a vast carbon sink. Plants' process of photosynthesis withdraws carbon dioxide from the air, combines it with water and sunlight to produce energy, and ultimately embeds carbon in dirt through roots, while releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere. Soil, if left undisturbed, can retain the converted carbon for years.
Agricultural companies, long criticized as environmental villains, say that paying farmers to maximize those natural processes can put the scale of modern farming behind a potential climate solution. Farmers, following half a decade of lean crop prices, are contemplating a possible new source of income that is less dependent on weather and agricultural commodity markets. The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the agriculture sector accounts for 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
President-elect Joe Biden's administration also plans to pursue the concept. Mr. Biden said this month that under his administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will direct federal conservation payments to farmers who use their fields to capture more carbon.
There is no U.S. federal requirement for companies to offset their greenhouse gas emissions, whether by buying credits from farmers or other means. But some companies say they are voluntarily looking for ways to reduce or eliminate their carbon footprint, to attract environmentally conscious consumers and investors, and pursue their own corporate missions.
In September, while other Iowa farmers were tilling their fields after harvest to help combat weeds, Kelly Garrett headed out to plant again. The wheat and rye he sowed on his farm near Denison, Iowa, won't be harvested and sold. Keeping his fields covered with growth over the winter months, he said, keeps his soil enriched and boosts the quantity of carbon dioxide his fields can pull from the atmosphere. In the spring, he plants his typical crops into the residue.
It is also padding his bottom line. In early November, Mr. Garrett posed in one of his corn fields with an oversize check for $75,000, proceeds from selling 5,000 carbon credits that his farm generated through a program being developed by the agricultural startups Nori LLC and Locus Agricultural Solutions.
"There's a lot of money to be made here for farmers," said Mr. Garrett, who adopted carbon-trapping practices on his farm several years ago to help enrich his soil.
The buyer of Mr. Garrett's carbon bounty was Shopify Inc. The e-commerce platform used the carbon reductions generated by Mr. Garrett's farm to help offset carbon emissions from the boats, planes and trucks transporting goods sold through Shopify's platform during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend of Nov. 27 to Nov. 30.
Shopify's Shop Pay payment system automatically offsets emissions associated with purchases. Stacy Kauk, director of Shopify's Sustainability Fund, said that and other efforts have helped draw more than 60 million users to the system. "Customers are voting with their wallets and supporting companies that align with their values," she said.
Some agricultural companies, including Bayer and Nutrien as well as startups like Nori and Indigo Ag, aspire to be carbon middlemen, offering products and services to develop platforms where farmer-generated credits can be bought and sold. Others, including Cargill, Corteva Inc. and Archer Daniels Midland Co. are facilitating and funding farmers' efforts as a way to burnish the companies' own climate commitments and those of their customers, such as grain buyers.
Farmers that participate in the carbon credit programs so far have generally received between $7 and $40 per acre, depending on farmers' practices. The companies say those practices can be verified through data beamed from tractors to online farm management systems, and by monitoring fields with satellites and soil tests. A typical Iowa corn farmer this year will earn $49 to $246 per acre, and between a $28 loss and a $172 profit for soybeans, according to Iowa State University analyses.
"The only way this will work is if there is real revenue on the table for farmers," said Emma Fuller, director of sustainability science for Corteva's data science unit Granular, which is helping manage farmers' carbon data.
Some in the food industry are wary of investing heavily behind still-new scientific models for measuring farm-driven carbon reductions, over concerns that the calculations could later turn out to be faulty. And despite growing Farm Belt momentum, some environmental groups are leery.
Jim Walsh, senior energy policy analyst for Food and Water Watch, said that polluting companies could use carbon offset purchases as a way to avoid cleaning up their own operations. Craig Cox, senior vice president of agriculture and natural resources for the Environmental Working Group, said that permanently converting land to trees and natural grasses is a more surefire way of sequestering carbon, since farmers' climate-friendly practices could easily be undone if a field changes hands.
"If the practices disappear, are the credits refunded?" Mr. Cox said. Carbon-credit registries typically require legal commitments from farmers and landowners to maintain carbon-capturing practices, and can include monitoring periods, company officials said.
Mr. Garrett, the Iowa farmer, said he generated 22,745 carbon credits by verifying through Locus and Nori his practices from the past five years, like conserving irrigation water, spreading manure as fertilizer and giving up tillage. He said he is committed to the carbon-capturing practices, because they improve his soil quality and crop yields enough to pay off even without carbon payments. He said he believes climate change is producing more volatile weather, such as the derecho storm system that leveled portions of his cornfields last summer.
The proceeds from selling carbon credits to Shopify helped Mr. Garrett offset his purchase this fall of 160 acres of farmland, he said, and another buyer is ready to buy the remainder.
"If we sell all the credits, it'll pay for one-third of the farm," Mr. Garrett said.

Full text: President-elect Joe Biden said Thursday he plans to nominate Michael Regan, a North Carolina environmental regulator, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.) as Interior secretary.
Mr. Regan runs North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality. He spent nearly a decade early in his career at the EPA before taking on regional jobs at the Environmental Defense Fund and in his home state.
Mr. Biden would be appointing the second Black EPA administrator in the agency's 50-year history at a time when he wants the agency to put more emphasis on protecting minority and poor communities disproportionately affected by pollution.
Ms. Haaland, an enrolled citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico, would be the first Native American cabinet secretary if she is confirmed. She has received the support of climate-change groups and others in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.
Mr. Regan and Ms. Haaland are part of a team Mr. Biden has assembled to address climate as one of his top priorities. Thursday's announcement also listed former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm to be named as energy secretary; former EPA chief Gina McCarthy as national climate adviser; and Brenda Mallory as chair of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality, all previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Last month Mr. Biden named former Secretary of State John Kerry to a newly created position, the special envoy for climate change to handle international diplomacy.
"This brilliant, tested, trailblazing team will be ready on day one to confront the existential threat of climate change with a unified national response rooted in science and equity," Mr. Biden said in the announcement. "They share my belief that we have no time to waste to confront the climate crisis, protect our air and drinking water, and deliver justice to communities that have long shouldered the burdens of environmental harms."
Mr. Biden has been rolling out a series of picks for energy and environmental positions in recent days. He has promised to take action against climate change, including pushing power plants, oil-and-gas producers and auto makers to drastically reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions.
The EPA is also the lead agency for climate-change regulations, and Mr. Biden has promised to push power plants, oil and gas producers, and auto makers to drastically reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. The agency has been shrinking under years of budget pressure, and the Trump administration has worked to limit its authority.
Mr. Regan was offered the job and accepted it around midday Thursday, according to a person familiar with the discussions. He became a front-runner for the job recently.
The person familiar with the discussions said Mr. Regan had held polluters accountable as head of North Carolina's DEQ and had worked to address environmental injustices through the creation of the Environmental Justice and Equity Board. The environmental-justice movement wants to ensure fair treatment for disadvantaged groups that tend to be more affected by pollution.
Mr. Regan created the state's board in 2018 under pressure from activists. Several types of heavy industry have concentrated in poorer regions in the eastern part of the state, and activists said Mr. Regan didn't do enough to address that, according to local news reports. The board of 16 people is largely made up of community organizers and academics -- many of them Black, Latino or Native American -- charged with guiding the department to ensure its policies are fair.
The post atop the EPA tends to draw scrutiny from all political sides. The country's top environmental regulator has a far reach into major U.S. economic sectors, including energy, farming and manufacturing, meaning it has been a target of lobbying from business groups and criticism from conservatives. Environmentalists have said the agency isn't doing enough to stop polluters.
Mr. Biden's consideration of Mr. Regan for the job drew opposition from at least one labor leader. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, in a recent conversation with Mr. Biden's team, raised concerns about the possible nomination, according to people familiar with the matter.
One of the issues in Mr. Regan's tenure as North Carolina's top regulator is a coal-ash cleanup state regulators called the biggest in U.S. history. Mr. Regan engineered a legal settlement with Duke Energy Corp. to move 80 million tons of ash to lined landfills and close all of its ash basins in the Carolinas, at a cost of $8 billion to $9 billion.
Ms. Haaland, who represents a district that includes Albuquerque, had the support of a range of people for the Interior job, including Native American tribes, progressive leaders and some House Republicans.
Ms. Haaland currently leads the House subcommittee on national parks, forests and public lands in the natural-resources committee. She has advocated for conserving at least 30% of U.S. land and water by the end of the decade.

Full text: Cash is pouring into investments intended to combat climate change and otherwise benefit society. Now, evidence is emerging that all of the money is starting to have an impact.
A growing body of research shows that companies and governments that borrow using so-called green bonds can save a bit of money. The market for these bonds, which fund environmental objectives such as renewable power, is booming. All that money is driving up the prices and pushing down yields on the bonds, making borrowing slightly cheaper.
Analysts around the world are mining bond-market data to quantify what they call "the greenium," a measurement of how much extra investors will pay for green bonds compared with conventional bonds.
One of the greenium hunters, Thierry Roncalli, has been commuting to the deserted Paris headquarters of money manager Amundi SA during the pandemic to crank up the three computers he needs to run his complex calculations. His team found that companies and governments selling green bonds received a premium as large as 0.11 percentage point -- modest, but enough to meaningfully lower borrowing costs.
"Our results show borrowers get an advantage from issuing green bonds," said Mr. Roncalli, head of Amundi's quantitative research department.
The finding is a sign that booming demand for environmentally sustainable investments could now be large enough to influence the behavior of corporations and governments. While a broad bond-market rally has pulled borrowing costs near historic lows, investors with sustainability goals are willing to lend to green projects at even lower rates.
Verizon Communications Inc. collected a roughly 50% bigger premium for the $1 billion green bond it issued in September to fund renewable energy projects than it did for its first green bond sold in February 2019, said Scott Krohn, the company's treasurer. Investors paid a roughly 0.14 percentage point premium on the recent deal, he said, shaving about $1.4 million off the debt's annual interest expense.
"The greenium is a data point that shows the advantage of green borrowing to corporations, and it will encourage more corporations to enter the market," said Marilyn Ceci, global head of environmental, social and governance debt capital markets at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Green bonds pay for projects such as transitioning factories, power grids and office buildings to clean technology. Borrowers must certify that deal proceeds go to such goals. The bonds have existed for about a decade, but few non-European investors purchased them and they often sold at lower prices than conventional bonds -- meaning they cost more to borrow than so-called brown bonds. That changed in recent years as investors increasingly adopted environmental social and governance (ESG) investing principles to address global problems while reducing portfolio risk. Sales of new green bonds hit a monthly record of $32 billion in September, bringing the overall size of the market to nearly $1 trillion, according to data from nonprofit group the Climate Bonds Initiative.
Still, it has been uncertain how much of a premium green- bond issuers can expect, deterring even climate-minded borrowers from using them. Sweden, one of the most environmentally progressive countries, waited to issue its first green bond until this September, when it was confident the move was advantageous.
"They went through a detailed study for two years . . . to prove they would not be doing something that would come at a cost to the taxpayer," said a banker who worked on Sweden's $2.3 billion deal. Investors accepted a yield that was 0.01 percentage point lower than comparable Swedish government bonds, he said. Bond yields fall as prices rise.
Quantifying the yield differential on green bonds is complicated because companies and governments have dozens of conventional bonds with varying due dates and interest rates with which to compare them. And with few green bonds outstanding -- only 3% of global bond issuance was green in 2019, according to the International Finance Corp. -- it can be hard to find enough samples for statistical study.
Outcomes also vary by geography and borrower type. A study of euro-denominated bonds by a French business school showed borrowers could save 0.18 percentage point of yield by going green, while a Stanford University analysis of U.S. municipal bonds found "little evidence of a pricing differential."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President-elect Joe Biden is planning to tap former Obama administration Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy as national climate adviser and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm as energy secretary, according to people familiar with the matter.
In Ms. McCarthy's role, she will lead a newly formed White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy. Ali Zaidi, New York's deputy secretary for energy and environment, will serve as Ms. McCarthy's deputy, people familiar with the matter said.
Ms. McCarthy, who declined to comment, will work closely with former Secretary of State John Kerry, Mr. Biden's special envoy for climate change. Her position doesn't require Senate confirmation.
Mr. Biden's top advisers also have expressed increased interest in picking Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.) to lead the Interior Department. But House Democrats have pushed back, telling transition officials that they can't afford to lose another lawmaker to the administration because of the party's slim majority, people familiar with the discussions said.
The president-elect is expected to formally announce key energy and environment positions this weekend, but one person familiar with the internal deliberations said Mr. Biden was still deliberating on his EPA administrator.
Ms. Granholm, who endorsed Mr. Biden for president in March, served as Michigan's Democratic governor from 2003 to 2011 and as the state's attorney general for the preceding four years. One of her signature policies as governor was a mandate for the state to increase the share of its energy derived from renewable sources like solar and wind.
If confirmed as energy secretary, Ms. Granholm would oversee U.S. scientific research and the country's nuclear arsenal, and could help incentivize the development of low-carbon energy sources through the distribution of federal loans. She would likely work closely with other senior officials, including the incoming head of the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House climate coordinator, to pursue Mr. Biden's campaign pledge to achieve net-zero emissions in the U.S. by 2050.
Ms. Granholm didn't respond to requests to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Biden's transition team declined to comment.
As governor, Ms. Granholm pushed a renewable portfolio standard requiring 10% of the state's energy to come from renewable sources by 2015, a percentage that was later increased. During her tenure, she also worked closely with the Obama administration to help the auto industry, which faced collapse following the economic downturn. She has credited Mr. Biden with playing a key role in bolstering General Motors Co. and Chrysler during that period.
Ms. Granholm and Mr. Biden have a close relationship dating back years. She helped Mr. Biden prepare for his vice- presidential debate during the 2008 campaign.
Other candidates Mr. Biden has considered for the energy secretary job included Arun Majumdar, a Stanford University professor and former vice president for energy at Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and former Deputy Energy Secretary Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall.
Mr. Majumdar could be nominated for another senior role at the Energy Department, possibly deputy secretary, some of the people familiar with the matter said.
During the Obama administration, he became the first leader of the department's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, working there from 2009 to 2012. The agency funds early-stage innovation projects, modeled on the research arm of the Defense Department that is known as a catalyst for breakthroughs.
Mr. Biden has promised to place a new emphasis on this kind of work in government, including creating a new agency called "ARPA-C," to address climate change. Mr. Biden has called climate change an urgent crisis.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President-elect Joe Biden is nearing a final decision on environment-related jobs that are being watched closely by the energy industry as well as progressives who are concerned about Mr. Biden's commitment to ambitious climate policies and diversity.
Mr. Biden is expected to announce as soon as later this week his nominees to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, as well as a senior White House official in charge of coordinating domestic climate-change policies, people familiar with the matter said.
Advisers to the president-elect said he hadn't yet finalized his picks, but leading contenders are emerging. Mr. Biden is balancing several factors, including diversity, gender and geography, along with expertise in areas like environmental justice, the people said. Much of the decision-making is connected, with choices for some posts influencing who gets chosen for others.
Rep. Deb Haaland (D., N.M.) is a leading contender for Interior secretary, according to people familiar with the matter. If confirmed, she would be the first Native American cabinet secretary. Activists and progressives are pushing for a Native American to run the agency, which oversees federal lands and the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Ms. Haaland's stock has risen among some of Mr. Biden's advisers in recent days. But some Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about losing another lawmaker to the administration because of their slim majority in the House.
Ms. Haaland and Biden teams are in discussions, but no offer has been made, according to a person familiar with the matter. Retiring Sen. Tom Udall (D., N.M.), whose father served as Interior secretary, is also among the potential candidates, as is former Deputy Interior Secretary Michael Connor, who also has Native American heritage.
A spokesman for Mr. Biden's transition team declined to comment.
Environmentalists have pushed Mr. Biden to embrace ambitious policies to lower the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change and to avoid anyone with ties to oil, coal and other fossil-fuel industries. Other progressive groups have also pushed Mr. Biden to appoint people they see as champions for racial justice who can fulfill Mr. Biden's promise to better protect minority and poor communities that are disproportionately affected by industrial pollution.
In the past week, transition team leaders asked for a list of additional candidates for EPA administrator -- potentially one of Mr. Biden's most important and contentious nominations.
Mr. Biden is now considering Michael Regan, a North Carolina environmental regulator, to lead the EPA, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Regan previously worked at the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group. He spent more than nine years at the EPA, where he focused on air-quality issues.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Regan at North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Richard Revesz, a law professor at New York University, is also a candidate for the job, the people said. Mr. Revesz declined to comment. The National Wildlife Federation's chief executive, Collin O'Mara, a former Delaware regulator, is also still in consideration.
For weeks, Mr. Regan, who is Black, hadn't been mentioned among the front-runners, a group that had been led by Mary Nichols, California's top air regulator. Some Democrats raised concerns about whether Ms. Nichols could get confirmed if Republicans hold a Senate majority, and in recent weeks dozens of progressive groups have also protested her record, saying she hadn't done enough to protect minority communities.
Former Obama administration EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy is under consideration for the White House climate coordinator post, the people familiar with the matter said. If chosen, Ms. McCarthy would work closely with John Kerry, Mr. Biden's special envoy for climate change. Ms. McCarthy declined to comment.
Ali Zaidi, New York's deputy secretary for energy and environment, is being considered as the White House's deputy climate coordinator, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zaidi served in a number of energy-related roles during the Obama administration.

Full text: Exxon Mobil Corp. pledged to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations over the next five years and eliminate routine flaring of methane by 2030, responding to pressure from activists and investors to lower its carbon footprint.
The Texas-based oil giant said Monday that it would cut the "intensity" of emissions from its oil-and-gas production by 15% to 20% by 2025. It didn't provide hard numbers on how much of total emissions those reductions would represent.
The company also said it would end routine flaring, or burning, of methane from its oil-and-gas operations in the next 10 years. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that, like carbon dioxide, contributes to climate change, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The targets are related to emissions that come directly from Exxon's operations and not from its products, like gasoline and jet fuel. Exxon said it would begin disclosing emissions data related to its products next year.
"We respect and support society's ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and continue to advocate for policies that promote cost-effective, market-based solutions to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said.
The targets stop short of pledges by European peers, including BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, to reach net-zero carbon emissions -- efforts Mr. Wood has previously called a "beauty competition."
Exxon said Monday that it would reduce its methane emissions intensity by 40% to 50% and cut its flaring intensity by 35% to 45% by 2025. The company said those targets are consistent with the Paris climate accord from which President Trump withdrew the U.S. that Exxon says it supports.
A newcomer activist investor launched a proxy fight against Exxon last week, arguing the beleaguered energy giant needs to act faster to remake itself and invest in clean energy.
Engine No. 1, an investment firm with a sustainability bent, said in a letter sent to Exxon that it needs to explore significant investment in clean energy to help the company profitably meet emission-reduction targets. The letter, which also argued for cost-cutting measures and other changes, identifies four people the firm plans to nominate to Exxon's 10-person board.
"While reducing emissions intensity is important, nothing in ExxonMobil's stated plans better positions it for long-term success in a world seeking to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions," Engine No. 1 said Monday in response to Exxon's pledge.
Exxon said it regularly meets with investors but doesn't provide details of specific conversations.
Some of Exxon's largest investors have pushed the company on climate-related issues for years. BlackRock Inc. has a history of singling out Exxon as moving too slowly to address climate risks, and it cited those concerns earlier this year in voting against two Exxon directors and in favor of separating the chairman and CEO roles. The directors were elected, and the roles weren't separated.
Peter Trelenberg, Exxon's director of greenhouse gas and climate change, said on a call with reporters Monday that the targets were a product of Exxon's annual planning and budgeting process. He didn't signal any new investments in clean energy.
Mr. Trelenberg said the new intensity targets would result in an overall reduction in Exxon's carbon emissions but didn't provide any specific data. Reducing emissions intensity generally means cutting it per amount of energy produced, but a company can still increase emissions overall if it is producing more oil and gas in total.
Mr. Trelenberg also said that Exxon hadn't set targets for reductions to emissions from its products, referred to as scope 3 emissions, because it has control only over emissions from its operations.
"Scope 3 is going to be a function of how society decides to reduce emissions across the energy system," he said.
Exxon said it would also continue to factor environmental performance into executive compensation and support putting a price on carbon.

Full text: Unilever PLC said it would become the first major company to voluntarily give shareholders a vote on its efforts to reduce carbon emissions, seeking greater engagement with investors on climate issues.
The owner of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream said Monday it would seek approval from investors every three years on its plan to mitigate its carbon impact and the risks of climate change on its business. However, the vote would be only advisory and doesn't require Unilever to make changes.
Major investors say they are putting more emphasis on addressing the threats posed by climate change, with shareholder resolutions on the issue becoming more common. By proposing its own climate resolutions for shareholders to vote on -- which take into account the challenges and realities of achieving them -- Unilever is in the driving seat, said one big investor.
BlackRock Inc., one of Unilever's largest investors, said earlier this year that it would be increasingly likely to vote against management and boards if companies don't disclose climate-change risks and plans in line with key industry standards.
Climate Action 100+, a group of large investors including BlackRock that is pressuring companies to act on climate change, welcomed Unilever's announcement as meaningful.
"Despite only being an advisory vote, it will allow investors to provide a clear statement of intent to the company about the importance of sticking to its plans for a transition to net-zero emissions," said Piers Hugh Smith, the investor group's point person for Unilever.
A Unilever spokeswoman said investor interest in managing the transition to net zero was growing and that the company wanted to send a signal that it was serious about meeting these targets.
The consumer-goods giant is among the growing number of companies setting public targets for cutting carbon emissions over the next few years. London-based Unilever has promised to eliminate emissions from its own operations by 2030 and to do the same from sourcing to point of sale by 2039. It also plans to halve the footprint of its products in the next decade, which involves the more difficult process of cutting emissions from consumers using its products.
To achieve those goals, Unilever said it would need to rethink the raw materials it sources, use more renewable energy and eliminate deforestation from its supply chain, among other measures. The company said it would rely on carbon credits to balance residual emissions.
Nestle SA said earlier this month that it would invest the equivalent of about $3.6 billion over the next five years in cutting carbon emissions as the Nescafe coffee owner works toward hitting its own targets. Other consumer-goods giants such as Colgate-Palmolive Co., Procter & Gamble Co. and Kimberly Clark Corp. have made similar pledges.
Unilever said it would share more details about its climate strategy in the first quarter and plans to report on its annual progress in 2022.

Full text: Some of the largest money managers in Europe pledged on Friday to make their investment portfolios reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.
The group of 30 signatories represent more than $9 trillion in assets and include Bank of Montreal Global Asset Management, Wellington Management in North America, Asset Management One in Japan, AXA Investment Managers, Legal & General Investment Management and UBS Asset Management.
As part of the commitment, the group of signatories, called the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, said it would work with clients on these goals and set interim targets in line with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. These targets will have to be set within the next year and reviewed every five years, with the aim to have all of the group's assets under management eventually included, the group said in a statement.
The pledge is the latest effort by asset managers, including asset management firm BlackRock Inc., to encourage companies they invest in for their clients to meet higher environmental standards. BlackRock, however, hasn't signed onto this initiative.
Many of the recent green commitments haven't specified consequences for companies that don't meet the emissions targets.
The group of asset managers said divesting from companies would be a last resort.
"We want to engage with the companies that we invest in, to ensure that they're creating these targets, rather than focusing only on divestment, which would decarbonize our portfolios, but not decarbonize the real economy, and then, therefore, our portfolios would still be subject to the worst effects of physical climate change," said Wendy Cromwell, vice chair and director for sustainable investment at Wellington Management, at a press conference.
The 30 asset managers committed to using their shareholder voting and lobbying power to place more pressure on the companies in their portfolios to take climate action.
Investors are increasingly using their proxy voting rights to pressure companies to take action. During the 2020 proxy season, shareholder support for climate-change disclosures from U.S. companies averaged at 40%, up from 26% in 2016, according to fund tracker Morningstar. The number of investors committing to net zero is also expected to grow considerably next year, U.K. bank Barclays says.
The asset managers have also committed to creating new investment products in line with the net-zero emissions goal.
"This is a welcome step from the asset-management community, which we hope will inspire all managers to ratchet up their climate-related ambitions," said Peter Uhlenbruch, head of investor standards at ShareAction, a responsible-investment nonprofit.
He said the real test will be "how quickly signatories translate ambition into action by escalating their engagement with companies."
The asset managers said they would publish annual progress reports and disclose in line with recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, an organization chaired by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that provides a framework for companies to report climate-change risks.
The number of listed companies with a net-zero pledge has tripled over the past year from 500 in late 2019, according to research by Data-Driven EnviroLab and the NewClimate Institute. Big corporations such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., and companies in emissions-intensive industries like oil major Royal Dutch Shell, have recently announced greenhouse gas emission-reduction targets.
"In 2021, we anticipate even more companies announcing net-zero targets and more investor scrutiny of strategies that firms have put in place to meet targets . . . and we expect the next step to be at the investor level, with asset managers making net-zero commitments related to their investment portfolios," says Charlotte Edwards, who is part of Barclays' ESG research team.

EXCHANGE --- The Dicey Economics of Oil --- Even before the pandemic, oil producers faced threats from renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate change. Is now the time for investors to strike, or slip away?

Full text: Does investing in oil and gas companies still make sense? Money manager Jacinto Hernandez has doubts.
The partner at Capital Group Cos. liquidated $1 billion in oil and gas stocks as Covid-19 spread around the globe in February, according to regulatory filings. Mr. Hernandez said he suspected the expansion of the new coronavirus in Italy was about to crush global demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel -- and with it, any near-term thesis for investing in oil companies. For Mr. Hernandez, the future of fossil-fuel investing depends on the virus and consumer behavior.
Adam Waterous, a Canadian private-equity investor, looked at the same circumstances and came to the opposite conclusion: This was the time to buy. Demand will eventually bounce back, he said, and when it does, prices will spike sometime later this decade. He backed up that conviction in July when his Waterous Energy Fund purchased a big stake in an oil sands company.
"There is absolutely a stigma about investing in oil and gas," Mr. Waterous said. "It hasn't been a sexy industry for a while."
The question of whether to invest in oil and gas has become a polarizing issue in the world of money management. Even before the pandemic sapped the world's thirst for fuel, the future of the fossil-fuel industry was already under threat due to the rise of electric cars, the proliferation of renewable energy and growing consciousness about the long-term impact of climate change.
The biggest oil companies increasingly disagree on what the future holds. Exxon Mobil Corp. continues to invest in increasing oil production and has said it believes oil demand will increase for years to come. BP PLC, by contrast, believes demand may already have peaked and plans to reduce its oil and gas production by 40% over the next decade as it pivots to green energy.
What makes the situation even more challenging for investors are new questions about the direction of oil prices, which no longer follow the fairly predictable cycle of boom and bust that governed the industry for much of the past century. Prices traditionally fell when supply exceeded demand, and rose when reduced investment in new drilling resulted in shortages. In the past decade, America's widespread adoption of hydraulic fracturing disrupted that historic pattern, resulting in a flood of new oil that could be produced quickly. That tamped down price spikes and eroded profits.
Brent oil, the global benchmark, last topped $100 a barrel six years ago. This April, the pandemic briefly led U.S. oil prices to fall into negative territory for the first time ever. So much oil backed up in storage that investors literally paid people to take it off their hands. When prices recovered, oil companies didn't benefit as they might have in the past. Since the end of April, U.S. oil prices have more than doubled but a stock index of U.S producers is up only about 25%. Brent crude prices topped $50 a barrel this week for the first time since early March, closing at $49.99 Friday, part of a broad market rally fueled by investors' anticipation for a 2021 economic resurgence.
The quandary investors now face is this: Will global oil demand recover before electric vehicles, renewable power, and environmental regulations permanently dent the market for fossil fuels?
There are signs that demand may not recover permanently. The International Energy Agency expects that global oil demand will peak sometime in the 2030s even as the world churns through around 90 million to 100 million barrels of oil a day for the next two decades. Next year, capital expenditures in renewable power supply are expected to overtake oil and gas for the first time in history, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Investors are one of the main forces driving this transformation, according to Goldman. Climate change-related shareholder resolutions have nearly doubled since 2011, the bank said, with the largest share of them, about 30%, directed at oil and gas companies.
The challenge facing traditional oil and gas companies is how to make money as the industry changes. The minimum rate of return required to finance long-term oil projects has increased to as much as 20%, according to Goldman, compared with as little as 3% for renewable projects. That gap suggests investors are factoring in higher regulatory costs for carbon producers, according to Goldman.
The squeeze on capital has led to a dramatic pullback in spending. This month, both Exxon and Chevron Corp. sharply reduced their capital expenditure plans by billions of dollars a year through 2025.
Even if oil prices go up due to a decrease in oil and gas supply, as analysts predict, companies are unlikely to sign off on new mega projects due to long-term fears about energy demand. Raymond James estimates oil project investment will never fully recover to previrus levels.
Some investors aren't waiting around to find out how things turn out. Those who are paid to mirror the broader market have all but abandoned the industry due to changes in the composition of the S&P 500. Energy stocks have fallen to less than 3% of the S&P 500 and Exxon was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in August.
For investors who still have an appetite to own Western oil companies, two divergent corporate options are emerging. The first, pursued mostly by U.S. oil companies, is premised on sustained, though relatively reduced, investment in oil and gas production to capture an uptick in commodity prices later this decade. Exxon and Chevron primarily aim to address climate change by reducing the carbon intensity of fossil fuels, through technologies like carbon capture -- which reuses emissions or stores them underground. Both say maintaining their dividend is a priority.
"[W]e conclude that the needs of society will drive more energy use in the years ahead -- and an ongoing need for the products we produce," Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods wrote in a note to employees in October.
The second option, predominantly pursued by European oil companies, involves a dramatic corporate shift to investing in renewable energy, based, in part, on a belief that oil demand may plateau sooner than expected. BP and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions, using oil proceeds to fund billions of dollars of investment in renewable energy. Both have cut their dividends to free up cash. BP plans to shrink its fossil fuel production over time.
"The more we understand about the impact of Covid-19 . . . the more convinced we are that the path we have chosen and the destination we have set are the right ones for BP," BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said in a note to employees in August. "And we intend to move quickly -- within a decade, we expect to be a very different kind of energy company."
So far, neither strategy is popular among investors. Since May, Exxon's shares are roughly flat, and BP's are down about 8%. No oil and gas company has figured out how to make money in a low carbon-energy world, according to Peter Bryant, a managing partner at business consultant Clareo.
"Exxon and BP are two sides of the same coin," Mr. Bryant said. "Investors don't like either."
While many investors support green investment, they are unconvinced major oil companies can make the new business profitable. According to a Boston Consulting Group survey of 150 investors, 86% believe clean-energy investments could help oil and gas companies, but only 25% of them said oil and gas stocks will become a larger part of their portfolio in the next decade.
One activist investor, Jeff Ubben of Inclusive Capital Partners, is buying the European transition story. He invested $75 million in BP in March and set a five-year goal to make money from the investment.
He is currently raising more for his fund. "If I am successful in raising the money I will put $1 billion into a big oil company," he said.
Mr. Ubben said he believes major oil companies should have excess cash to spend on clean energy by cutting costs, spending and dividends. The firm bought BP shares after 50-year-old Mr. Looney became chief executive in February and said the British conglomerate would reduce its dependence on oil.
Mr. Ubben's firm has made several other low-carbon energy and technology investments, including electric-truck startup Nikola Corp. and electricity producer AES Corp. While he said he doesn't believe the virus will accelerate the clean energy transition, Mr. Ubben does think it will increase divestment from oil and gas companies. To counteract that, he said the companies should use their cash flows to transform the business instead of increasing dividends or buying back stock.
Why would you return money to shareholders, he said, "if you want to be an energy company of the future?"
Not all investors share this view. After Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War II in April, the asset management division of Virginia-based broker-dealer Davenport & Company LLC sold its position in the oil giant.
"We thought they could continue paying that dividend so that just took us a bit by surprise," said Bradford Seagraves, research analyst at Davenport. "The income component was certainly an important consideration for us."
Shell increased its dividend by a small amount in October after cutting it by two-thirds, telling investors it could cover both the payout and its investments in renewable energy. The high dividend yields of Chevron and Exxon are attractive especially to individual investors who may rely on the payouts as a source of income, said Noah Barrett, an analyst at Janus Henderson Investors.
But the companies have to be able to cover the dividends from their cash flows for them to be sustainable, said Mr. Barrett. Exxon has had to borrow to cover its dividend this year, which costs it about $15 billion annually. Chevron hasn't had to take on substantial amounts of debt during the pandemic or borrow to cover its dividend.
"If I'm a retail investor I still care about the share price," said Mr. Barrett, who works for a Janus fund that owns Chevron shares. "The monthly check is nice, but the value of my holding is still going down."
The industry will need to return cash to investors quickly to convince them to shrug off long-term concerns about the value of their holdings, said Capital's Mr. Hernandez, who sold $1 billion in oil and gas stocks earlier this year. Declaring the end of the oil industry is premature, he said, but risks abound.
"We don't really know what the demand is going to be" for years to come, Mr. Hernandez said.
Those warnings don't faze Mr. Waterous, who previously headed investment banking at the Bank of Nova Scotia before founding Waterous Energy Fund in 2017. He said he believes investor disaffection with the industry is divorced from its supply and demand fundamentals, and that is why he pounced this spring after prices turned negative.
Within days, his team had put out proposals to acquisition targets. His fund purchased 45% of oil sands company Osum Production for about $111 million -- one of the few private equity oil deals thus far in 2020. In November, the fund launched a takeover bid to buy an additional 40% of Osum's shares for about $99 million.
"It became a five-alarm fire," he said. "It became, 'Oh my God, we've got to do this right away.'"

Full text: Climate change has the potential to wreak devastating effects on the places we call home. Global sea levels could rise by 6.5 feet by the end of the 21st century if greenhouse-gas emissions grow unchecked, according to a study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, putting the coastal homes of millions at risk of flooding or worse. Research in the same journal this year found that tropical cyclones are now 25% more likely to be a Category 3 storm or worse versus four decades ago, a trend scientists expect to continue, increasing potential property damage. And by the 2050s, the Pacific Northwest is projected to see a 78% increase in areas burned by wildfires, according to a 2009 study in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.
Homeowners, real-estate developers and local governments will need to get more creative to better withstand climate-fueled events. Here, experts offer their ideas.
Set Homes Afloat
When floods are not there, an "amphibious" house lives on the land like an ordinary house, but it's capable, when the flood comes, of staying above the flood by having some source of buoyancy that lifts the occupied parts of the house so that there's no damage. We could most inexpensively apply this retrofit system to simple wooden houses with a crawl space where we can place the buoyancy elements [like dock floats or foam blocks] that lift the house, such are as common across the Gulf Coast. When you're doing retrofit, you're not promoting development. You're just fixing houses that are vulnerable now and making it possible for communities to continue to live in the places that they've always lived and in the ways that they've always lived. In the future, people might be able to perform these retrofits for $25,000 or less. There's currently nothing in the building codes that addresses amphibious construction, and that is a major hurdle in the U.S.
-- Dr. Elizabeth English, professor of architecture at Canada's University of Waterloo, and founder and director of the Buoyant Foundation Project, a nonprofit that develops amphibious technologies
Give Homeowners Detailed Data
There are different levels of risk inside of each city or inside of a region, but not many communities have access to that [granular level of] data. It needs to be democratized for better decision-making both in local and metropolitan government and at the scale of the property. Climate-risk data needs to be at your fingertips. As a homeowner who is looking to buy a home, you should be able to have access to the data that matches the profile of your community: flood risk data, extreme heat data, fire hazard, mudslides. If we look into the future, particularly with the advancement in AI, what would be wonderful is if we were in a place where we had rapidly updated data -- on a year-to-year basis would be amazing.
-- Jeff Hebert, former chief resilience officer for the city of New Orleans, president of HR&A consulting firm
Get Paid When Disaster Strikes
We need more variations in the types of insurance policies that are offered, like parametric insurance, which offers fast and flexible dollars based on the event. For instance, when there's a Category 3 storm within 5 miles of my house, I get $10,000 regardless of what happened. Maybe my house is fine, but I had to evacuate and I had to pay for a hotel and food. I could use it for that. Microinsurance could also help lower-income households recover.
-- Dr. Carolyn Kousky, executive director at the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania
Fireproof Houses -- and Communities
If you're living in a forested area, it's not if, but when fire will come. When a fire comes, embers are raining down. You would then want to have a roof that is noncombustible, a metal roof or an asphalt shingle roof. You have materials that are fire-resistant that you can side your home with [like cement board, stucco and masonry]. There are some homeowners associations that mandate that you will construct your home with these materials and that you will do cleaning around your homes, and that is becoming more and more accepted. If you're able to create open areas, widened roads and water resources, like a pond or buried water tanks, for firefighting, and people are taking ownership and protecting their homes, then you won't see those entire subdivisions leveled, like we saw with the Paradise fire in California.
-- Jon Trapp, assistant chief at Red Lodge Fire Rescue, Montana
Seal Up the Cracks
Over 80% of our buildings we have today will remain. A salient question is how we retrofit those. The envelope of the house needs to be much more tied together to act as one system against wind-borne debris, water and things like that -- at critical junctures of the roof to other elements of the roof, and the roof to the walls, and the walls to the foundations. Another minimum standard is going to be high insulation rates which reduce your energy usage and protect you from extreme heat. New materials like aerogel [a fire-retardant material used to insulate spacecraft] give promise to fire suppression. One challenge is that some materials we currently use, like reinforced concrete, are carbon-intensive. How can we use carbon-intensive materials and aim for a sustainable future? That is a challenge, but we're working towards a solution.
-- Illya Azaroff, founding architect of +LAB Architect, associate professor of architectural technology at New York City College of Technology.

Full text: New York state's $226 billion pension fund on Wednesday pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions across its portfolio by 2040, placing more pressure on companies in North America and abroad to tackle climate change.
The New York State Common Retirement Fund, the country's third-largest state pension fund, said it would first undertake a four-year review of its investments in energy companies to determine whether they are committed to transitioning into cleaner power, and it will ramp up efforts to encourage corporations to reach net zero faster.
It will publish annual progress reports and conclusions on industrywide reviews in its portfolio spanning thousands of companies, which is largely through funds that track broad market indexes.
As of September, the fund had around $2.6 billion in fossil-fuel producers after it recently boosted low-carbon investment strategies.
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli told reporters that some $11 billion of the fund has gone into so-called climate solutions such as renewable energy and technology, with another $9 billion on the way.
"Investing for the low-carbon future is essential to protect the fund's long-term value," Mr. DiNapoli said. The state comptroller oversees the fund, which provides pensions for more than 1.16 million working and retired state government employees and beneficiaries.
Mr. DiNapoli said in some cases the fund could divest from polluters if they don't meet climate-change standards. "Divestment is a last resort, but it is an investment tool we can apply to companies that consistently put our investment's long-term value at risk," he said.
Under a climate-action plan set last year, the fund already has divested some $40 million from 22 coal companies and is finishing up a review of nine companies in the oil-sands business. Reviews of more oil-and-gas companies will follow.
More fund managers are demanding that companies set stronger policies on climate change amid mounting fears of fossil fuels losing value and severe weather.
This year, shareholder support for climate change disclosures from U.S. companies averaged at 40%, up from 26% in 2016, according to fund-trackers Morningstar Inc. Shareholder resolutions in the U.S. aren't binding because management can reject them at their discretion.

Full text: Exxon Mobil Corp. is facing the threat of a proxy fight from a newcomer activist investor with a sustainability bent that wants the beleaguered energy giant to act faster to remake itself.
Engine No. 1 LLC, an investment firm launched by Chris James last week, is preparing to send a letter to Exxon's board urging the Irving, Texas-based company to focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. The letter, a copy of which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal, identifies four people the firm plans to nominate to Exxon's 10-person board.
The San Francisco firm has the support of California State Teachers' Retirement System, the big pension investor, and expects other shareholders to be sympathetic to the cause, given widespread frustration over Exxon's share performance, a person familiar with the matter said. Calstrs holds a more than $300 million Exxon stake, while Engine No. 1 has one worth around $40 million, this person said.
Their combined ownership is smaller than what is typical for an activist taking on a company of Exxon's size, and it is possible the campaign will fall flat. Still, Calstrs holds sway as the country's second-largest pension fund and there have been instances of well-timed campaigns led by small shareholders gaining traction with other investors and yielding results.
"Without having seen the letter, we will decline to comment," said Casey Norton, an Exxon spokesman.
Key to the outcome will be the reaction from larger shareholders, especially Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., which together control nearly 20% of Exxon's shares.
BlackRock and State Street are part of Climate Action 100+, an investor group that pushes for companies to take swifter action to combat climate change. BlackRock, in particular, has a history of singling out Exxon for not moving quickly enough to address climate risks, and it cited those concerns earlier this year when it voted against two Exxon directors and in favor of separating the chairman and CEO roles. The directors were elected and the roles weren't separated.
Exxon, which just seven years ago was America's most valuable company, today has a market value of around $176 billion after the pandemic crushed demand for fossil fuels and laid bare prior strategic missteps.
With its shares down 40% so far this year, there has been speculation Exxon could attract an activist investor seeking to harness frustration among shareholders.
Engine No. 1's letter calls on Exxon to make four primary changes: 1) add independent directors with diversified energy-industry experience; 2) reduce capital expenditures, particularly on projects that are unlikely to break even with sustained low oil and gas prices; 3) formulate a plan to invest in growth areas such as renewable clean energy; and 4) realign management incentives.
"We believe that for ExxonMobil to avoid the fate of other once-iconic American companies, it must better position itself for long-term, sustainable value creation," the firm writes.
Engine No. 1 launched with $250 million under management and primarily manages Mr. James' own fortune, from technology investing. Its focus is on so-called impact investing, which seeks to push companies to make changes that are beneficial in the long run to stakeholders such as workers and shareholders alike.
Its team includes Charlie Penner, a former partner at activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, where he helped run campaigns at companies including Whole Foods Market. He also led Jana's successful joint effort with Calstrs in 2018 to push Apple Inc. to add features to help parents limit their children's screen time.
Companies of all kinds are facing pressure to reduce their impact on the environment. As rivals such as BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have begun investing in renewable energy -- a strategy that their investors haven't rewarded so far -- Exxon was seen as somewhat of a holdout, with Chief Executive Darren Woods vowing instead to spend more on oil exploration to increase production.
But recently Exxon has been taking actions to address shareholder concerns. Last week, it retreated from Mr. Woods' ambitious plan and said it would cut billions of dollars from its capital spending every year through 2025 and focus on investing in only the most promising assets. It also signaled it planned to take a write-down of as much as $20 billion on the value of natural-gas assets -- a move it had long resisted -- mostly stemming from the disastrous purchase of XTO Energy Inc. a decade ago.
Mr. Woods said the moves would help the company focus on improving earnings and strengthening its balance sheet to maintain the dividend. The dividend currently yields a whopping 9% and costs the company about $15 billion a year.
Exxon shares have risen about 9% since the announcement.
The window to officially nominate directors to Exxon's board doesn't open until later this month, and Engine No. 1 says in the letter it hopes Exxon will consider its nominees before that.
The nominees are: Gregory Goff, the former CEO of refiner Andeavor, which was sold to Marathon Petroleum Corp.; Kaisa Hietala, who previously led the renewables business of Finnish refiner Neste Oyj; Alexander Karsner, an executive of Alphabet Inc.'s innovation lab who served in the Energy Department under President George W. Bush; and Anders Runevad, former CEO of Vestas Wind Systems AS.

Full text: Winter outbreaks of Covid-19 might be worsened by colder weather and drier indoor air that boost transmission of the coronavirus, but it is too soon to know whether it will become truly seasonal, according to new research by scientists studying the disease.
In a dozen new studies, scientists have marshaled evidence that airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the disease is strongly affected by changes in temperature and humidity.
Winter's colder air will promote survival of the virus and drive people indoors where the drier air of many heated homes can have an even stronger influence on how long it remains infectious, the scientists said. Some scientists already see the consequences of cooler weather in near-record numbers of people hospitalized with Covid-19 in recent weeks.
"Dry indoor air is a dangerous thing because it's poorly ventilated; it helps virus stability; and it might also harm our immune defenses," said Dylan Morris, a bio-mathematician at the University of California in Los Angeles who models how viruses spread.
In several studies of coronaviruses and infection rates, epidemiologist Rachel Baker at Princeton University and her colleagues found that even a small seasonal change can have a substantial impact if safety measures aren't widely followed. "It could be that the climate in winter would push you over the edge by giving you this relatively small boost in transmission," said Dr. Baker, who investigates the effect of climate on infectious diseases.
Generally, many factors combine to drive seasonal infection trends for contagious respiratory diseases such as influenza, chickenpox and other coronaviruses, including the biochemistry of the virus, the physics of airborne droplets and the psychology of public health. These contagions are seasonal, even though many of them can be controlled by effective vaccines.
No one knows yet what impact Covid-19 vaccines now gaining approval might have on the long-term prospects for the disease. When widely adopted, they will likely significantly curb the current pandemic, leaving the coronavirus more driven by climate factors. Until then, the seasonal influence can be offset by people following public-health-control measures, including mask wearing and social distancing, the scientists say.
"We are still observing that human behavior is the main driver of transmission," said Mauricio Santillana, director of the Machine Intelligence Lab at Harvard University, who develops forecasts of Covid-19 outbreaks. "A very large part of the population is still susceptible to the coronavirus, and that is eclipsing other factors for now."
Earlier this year, some public-health authorities predicted a seasonal lull in the pandemic during hot, humid summer months. While cases dipped slightly, Covid-19 continued its spread through temperate and tropical areas world-wide. The tempering effect of weather was overshadowed by the sheer number of people vulnerable to the disease, the scientists said.
Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health tracked daily temperatures, humidity and Covid-19 trends in 913 U.S. counties this past summer. In unpublished preliminary findings posted online in November, they determined that Covid-19 cases were fractionally higher in northern counties than in southern counties, influenced most strongly by differences in humidity.
"Our findings indicated a potential increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the coming winter," said epidemiologist Kai Chen, the project's senior scientist, at the Yale Center on Climate Change and Health.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A broad cross section of big U.S. corporations including Amazon.com Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Ford Motor Co., are calling on Congress to work closely with President-elect Joe Biden to address the threat of climate change.
In a letter to be sent to Congress and the Biden transition team on Wednesday, more than 40 companies say they support the U.S. rejoining the Paris climate accord, and urge "President-elect Biden and the new Congress to work together to enact ambitious, durable, bipartisan climate solutions."
The letter doesn't detail any specific action plan or policy proposal, but it is the latest indication that a significant cohort of corporate America is lining up with environmentalists on climate change.
Companies are responding to pressure from both consumers and their own workers who are increasingly concerned about climate change. And they see a new president and Congress, including some conservatives, putting a bigger emphasis on finding ways to avoid catastrophic outcomes from a warming Earth.
"Climate is going to be a much bigger deal in the next Congress because there is the prospect of something happening" when previously there was none, said Stephen Harper, senior director of environment and energy policy for Intel Corp., one of the signatories. "It'll be smaller stuff, but hopefully it'll be a patchwork of things that add up to make a difference."
The letter was organized by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, or C2ES, an environmental group that works with businesses and governments. Several of the companies that signed it work with and help fund C2ES.
"The United States has made important strides -- emissions are down, and clean energy is up," the letter said. "With the election of a new President and Congress, we now have a critical opportunity to significantly strengthen these efforts."
The companies have warned of rising costs from climate-related disasters, and at times in Wednesday's letter echoed Mr. Biden's own campaign, saying leveraging American investment and innovation to respond can itself boost the U.S. economy.
Corporate momentum has been building in recent years on the need to address climate change. Several of the companies that signed the newest letter -- including Ford, International Business Machines Corp., Unilever PLC and Walmart Inc. -- have already signed on to support taxing emissions or have pledged to change their business practices to eliminate emissions from their own operations.
Several of those companies hope that by vocally supporting new legislation, it gives Republicans cover to take action in collaboration with Democrats, Intel's Mr. Harper and others said.
President Trump has worked to scale back many of the country's environmental regulations, and sometimes fumed at companies that didn't support his efforts.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President-elect Joe Biden has chosen Brian Deese, a former adviser to Barack Obama, to be the director of the National Economic Council, according to people familiar with the matter.
In his new post, which doesn't require Senate confirmation, Mr. Deese will play a lead role in implementing Mr. Biden's economic agenda, with a focus on rebuilding the economy amid a pandemic that has devastated many U.S. businesses and resulted in millions of lost jobs.
Mr. Deese served in multiple senior White House roles during the Obama administration. After working on Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign, he joined Mr. Obama's National Economic Council, eventually rising to deputy director. He then served as deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. He was later promoted to senior adviser to the president, a position that focused in part on climate change and energy issues. He played a central role in negotiating the international climate-change agreement that was reached in Paris in 2015.
During his White House tenure, he also worked on issues related to the automotive and financial industries, as well as the Supreme Court.
After leaving the White House, Mr. Deese joined BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, as global head of sustainable investing.
Some progressive groups have raised concerns about Mr. Deese's role at BlackRock, arguing that Mr. Biden shouldn't tap individuals with ties to corporations and the financial sector to serve in his administration.
Mr. Deese's former colleagues defended him.
"I consider Brian to be one of the smartest climate advocates that I ever had the pleasure to work with," said former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy, who worked alongside Mr. Deese during the Obama administration. "If anybody says he isn't a climate advocate, I can dispute that."
Mr. Deese didn't respond to requests to comment.
Mr. Biden's transition team, which declined to comment, didn't unveil Mr. Deese's appointment as part of several economy-related jobs announced on Monday. People familiar with the matter said Mr. Deese's appointment is expected to be announced in the coming days.
Axios first reported Mr. Deese's appointment.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Nearly two dozen Democratic-led states at odds with the Trump administration on climate-change policy joined forces last year to explore using the courts to secure federal mandates on greenhouse-gas emissions, according to records and interviews.
The coalition agreed to cooperate in planning litigation against the federal government and consulted with former Environmental Protection Agency officials as part of the discussions, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people involved in the effort.
The initiative lost momentum in recent months, some of these people said, amid fears of an uphill fight in federal court and because state leaders wanted to await results of the Nov. 3 election, which saw Democrat Joe Biden defeat President Trump. Some lawyers and people involved expect that these states are now more likely to focus on advancing their own policies rather than launching federal litigation.
Even so, the plans speak to how aggressive state governments have become in their efforts to sway Washington. Presidents have faced increasing opposition from state attorneys general from the opposite political party, and many expect Republican-led states to continue the trend with challenges to President-elect Biden's agenda.
The groundwork laid by the coalition of Democratic-led states could also come into play if Mr. Biden should fail to advance his platform aimed at slowing climate change.
"Climate change remains one of the greatest threats facing the people of our nation and around the world," said New York Attorney General Letitia James. "If we are to address this challenge, then all options must be on the table. With that said, we have no plans at this time to bring litigation seeking to promote one particular approach."
A White House spokesman said the Trump administration's deregulation efforts supported economic growth without sacrificing environmental protection. "Partisan Democrat attorneys general appear to want to use litigation to push their preferred policy agendas instead of protecting their citizens based on the rule of law and actual facts," said the spokesman Judd Deere.
Mr. Biden has promised to push power plants, auto makers, and oil and gas producers toward eliminating or vastly reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but many of his policies could face resistance.
Environmental groups and, to a lesser degree, states, have sometimes filed lawsuits against friendly administrations, aiming to lock federal agencies into settlements.
"With this climate threat growing worse every day, we've had to spend years in court trying to force the federal government to do its job and regulate greenhouse-gas emissions," said a spokeswoman for Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.
The documents reviewed by the Journal, dating to 2019, were obtained under open-records requests filed by Energy Policy Advocates, a nonprofit group that researches government lawsuits against the energy industry. The group says it receives funding from conservative groups but declined to identify specific donors, nor is it legally required to do so.
The records show that 21 states, including New York, California, Illinois and Massachusetts, were involved, along with the District of Columbia. The Journal confirmed the discussions revealed in these documents with several people involved in or familiar with the states' efforts.
"The plan appears to be for activists, attorneys general and bureaucrats to team up. . .to avoid democracy and political accountability for a major, costly economic restructuring," said Rob Schilling, the group's executive director.
One person familiar with the states' efforts called them "academic discussions." But even with the Trump administration leaving office, Mr. Schilling's group said the states could use the tactics to seek court rulings to mandate change from the Biden administration.
Jeffrey Wood, who oversaw environmental cases at the Justice Department early in the Trump administration, said such attempts face high barriers to success, in part because corporate opponents are on guard for settlements between federal agencies and outside parties such as states and environmental advocates.
"Blue states may be enticed. . .now that they have an ally in the White House, but the spotlight is on," said Mr. Wood, now a partner at Baker Botts LLP. He added that conservative appointees by Mr. Trump in the federal judiciary have also raised the level of difficulty.
Documents obtained from Michigan dated from July and August 2019 show that the coalition had created a working group devoted to "Climate Change -- Affirm. Litigation," or affirmative litigation. A spokeswoman for Michigan's Attorney General's Office confirmed their authenticity.
The legal initiative was led by lawyers from New York and Oregon, the documents show. They included Michael Myers, the New York attorney general's senior counsel for air pollution and climate change litigation, and Steve Novick, a special assistant attorney general in Oregon.
Oregon Justice Department officials declined to comment on the specific litigation effort. But they did release a response from Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum thanking other states for working together to fight Mr. Trump's environmental rollbacks.
---
Documents Reveal
A Push on Gases
Documents show a coordinated research effort as part of a larger state-led endeavor to fight Trump administration environmental deregulation.
In the summer of 2019, documents obtained from New Mexico show, 21 states and D.C. signed a "common interest agreement" allowing them to share information and plan confidentially on climate litigation.
The document's title says it is to require federal action "to reduce or limit emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change."
Those states "anticipate participating as litigants or counsel for litigants in judicial or administrative actions under state or federal law, including but not limited to the Clean Air Act, to require the federal government and/or private parties to take action to reduce or limit the emissions," the agreement says.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Facing the possibility of another two years of divided government, Democrats and Republicans are eyeing a familiar topic as a possible area of bipartisan compromise under the Biden administration: infrastructure.
Efforts to craft a major bill repeatedly fell apart during the Trump administration, and disagreements on the scope of the legislation and how to pay for it will persist under a new president. But a fresh push from the next White House could break the logjam, even if control of the House and Senate continues to be split between the two parties.
"It would seem to be something that we can work together on in a productive way," said Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.), the No. 3 Republican in the Senate and the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee.
Lawmakers see an infrastructure bill as a way both to stimulate an economy recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and to address an infrastructure system that experts say is deficient. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the U.S. a grade of D+ in its last evaluation of the nation's infrastructure, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has pushed for new investments.
The House passed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill over the summer, with about $500 billion aimed at highways, bridges, roads and public transit. The measure also sends funds toward housing, public schools and broadband internet access. President-elect Joe Biden has proposed a similar $2 trillion plan that funds transportation infrastructure as part of his efforts to combat climate change, including overhauling the energy grid, retrofitting buildings and conducting research.
Mr. Biden said on Monday that his infrastructure plan would provide long-term gains.
"These are the kinds of investments that will strengthen our economic competitiveness and create millions of jobs, union jobs," he said.
Only three House Republicans supported the House's $1.5 trillion bill, though, with most Republicans opposing it. GOP lawmakers said the bill was too expensive and overburdened with measures aimed at combating climate change, such as building charging stations for electric vehicles. The bill went nowhere in the Senate.
"The House basically took the Green New Deal and changed the title to House infrastructure bill, so we didn't have any luck working with them," said Mr. Barrasso.
But for Democrats who have sought legislative action on climate change for years, an infrastructure bill may be one of the few opportunities to tackle the topic in Congress. Rep. Kathy Castor (D., Fla.), the chairwoman of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, said an infrastructure bill will be central to Democratic efforts on climate change next year.
"We have to invest in significant infrastructure improvements, especially to our electric grid," she said. "I think there's pent-up appetite for significant investments."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said during a news conference last week that infrastructure will be a focus for Democrats next year.
A pair of runoff elections in Georgia will determine control of the Senate, though Democrats are bracing for Republicans to win those races.
Of course, a bipartisan interest in passing an infrastructure package has existed for years, to no avail.
Measures related to climate change are likely to become a focal point in any effort to put together an infrastructure bill, with Republicans indicating opposition to Democratic priorities on the issue.
"You can't push far-left infrastructure priorities and expect the Republican Senate to say, 'Oh, this is a great compromise,'" said Rep. Rodney Davis (R., Ill.).
President Trump has repeatedly called for Congress to pass an infrastructure bill, including in March when he pitched a $2 trillion plan. Those efforts have consistently fizzled, though.
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2019 unanimously approved a $287 billion highway bill, though the plan didn't advance beyond the panel.
Deciding how to pay for another infrastructure bill has consistently proved to be a stumbling block in previous negotiations, and the House bill didn't include a revenue source, like increasing the federal gasoline tax.
An attempt to craft an infrastructure bill next year would take place as the U.S. economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers see the desire for economic stimulus as possibly easing passage of a major infrastructure bill.
Talks on a fifth coronavirus relief package have been stalled for months, and those negotiations may bleed into the beginning of Mr. Biden's term.
"It's the big one, once we get past Covid issues and then can do infrastructure. If we can do those two, that's a pretty successful term of Congress, and I think that'd be big," said Rep. Dan Kildee (D., Mich.).

Full text: One of the best ways to make money on Wall Street recently has been to bet against the fossil-fuel industry and buy renewable-energy stocks. Two well-regarded investors believe the trend will accelerate after President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
Mr. Biden wants to transition the U.S. from an economy reliant on fossil fuels to one driven by wind, solar and other renewable-energy sources. The shift from fossil-fuel companies to renewable-energy firms accelerated during the Trump administration, despite the president's vows to support the U.S. coal and petroleum industries.
Investors already are pushing toward clean energy and Mr. Biden can give them a boost by tightening regulations and issuing executive orders banning new permitting of drilling projects on public lands.
Two factors are driving the shift: Big and small investors have moved their assets away from fossil-fuel producers and toward renewable energy companies. Big investors like BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, overseeing $7.8 trillion, have said they plan to take into account corporations' disclosures of environmental risks, including carbon footprints.
Small investors have poured cash into sustainable funds. In the third quarter, they put $80.5 billion in the sector globally, a 14% increase from the previous quarter, according to Morningstar. Sustainable funds had $1.26 trillion in assets at the end of September, up 19% from the second quarter.
Another big factor is cost. The International Energy Agency said in its 2020 world energy outlook that solar-energy projects "now offer some of the lowest-cost electricity ever seen" and are consistently cheaper than new coal and gas-fired power plants in most countries. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that renewables will be the most-used energy source in the world by 2050.
The result has been a significant outperformance of strategies that invest in assets that lead to lower carbon emissions. The iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund has doubled in value in the past five years, compared with a roughly 50% decline in the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund over the same period. The energy fund surged Monday following positive vaccine news.
In early October, NextEra Energy Inc., the U.S.'s largest renewable-energy company, surpassed the market valuation of Exxon Mobil Corp. The shift was a milestone in a market trend that has been building for years. The biggest U.S. company by market cap just seven years ago, Exxon has coughed up more than half of its value since then. NextEra shares, meanwhile, have more than tripled in the same period. The Florida power producer gets much of its growth from renewable energy and its 15,000 megawatts of renewable projects in development is larger than its entire existing renewables portfolio.
Some investors are betting these trends will continue. Robert Litterman, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investor and risk manager, launched a strategy in August designed to profit from a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy. The strategy, started by Kepos Capital, the $2 billion trading firm Mr. Litterman helped found, has gained about 4% since its launch as of late October, according to a person familiar with the investments.
"I think we're going to have a much more rapid transition to a net-zero [carbon] economy than most people expect," he said. "And that rapid transition means it's not all priced in."
It isn't a new strategy for Mr. Litterman. In 2014, the World Wildlife Fund, on Mr. Litterman's advice, invested in a derivative instrument that bet that a basket of fossil-fuel assets would underperform the broader market. The investment has posted an annualized return of 22% since then, according to a spokesman for the foundation.
Mr. Litterman chairs a group that assessed the risks of climate change for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In the foreword to a sweeping report the CFTC issued in September, Mr. Litterman compared the risk of delaying action against climate change with the costs of delaying responding to the coronavirus pandemic. Putting off addressing climate change will lead to "greater probability of irreversible and catastrophic damages," he wrote.
A Biden administration, he says, will weigh on returns for fossil-fuel companies. Mr. Biden has said he would take billions in federal subsidies away from fossil-fuel companies. He also has indicated that he might consider putting a price on carbon emissions along with an enforcement mechanism that will make carbon emitters "bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting," according to his climate plan.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Energy and climate policy will be among President-elect Joe Biden's top priorities when he steps into the Oval Office next year, but it could also prove one of his toughest challenges.
President Trump has been a champion of traditional energy industries such as coal and oil. Mr. Biden wants to supercharge a transition to cleaner energy sources and has said reversing several Trump administration rollbacks of regulations aimed at combating climate change is a priority.
Mr. Biden's presidential authority gives him the power to move quickly. He can order the U.S. back into the Paris climate accord, end a dispute with California on its tougher tailpipe-emission rules and work with it on a national standard, and slow or halt oil leasing on federal lands. He has promised to do all of these things.
"President-elect Biden looks forward to implementing his plans to tackle climate change while creating millions of good-paying, union jobs -- which not only earned unprecedented support from climate activists, environmental justice leaders, and labor leaders, but also helped deliver a historic victory," Biden spokesman Matt Hill said Monday.
Mr. Biden's biggest ambitions, however, will require help. He has proposed a $2 trillion overhaul for energy and transportation infrastructure as a way to address both climate change and the coronavirus pandemic's economic downturn. That would need support from Congress, and lobbyists and analysts expect Republicans will block many of his requests if they maintain Senate control.
A Republican Senate is likely to constrain Mr. Biden to working through the executive agencies, and only reviving and strengthening the environmental rules created when Mr. Biden was President Barack Obama's vice president. That could spare the oil industry in particular from what some of its leaders feared would be the most transformative policies aimed at shrinking its markets, and its ability to acquire land and drill.
Harold Hamm, the founder and executive chairman of Continental Resources Inc., said in an earnings call Friday that the energy industry will be counting on allies in Congress to help hold off environmental policies that are even tougher than what Mr. Obama approved.
"That's the game we'll be playing again -- to hold them at bay," Mr. Hamm said.
Lobbyists and analysts expect more modest, compromised plans. If a divided Congress does pass an economic stimulus package to help people through the pandemic, it is much less likely to be laden with energy and climate projects than if Democrats had commanding control of Congress, they said.
Concerned by Republican success in many down-ballot races, Congressional Democrats are pushing the Biden team to take more moderate positions and avoid policies that might seem punitive toward the oil industry, according to a person familiar with the talks. They will, however, make a big push on energy-infrastructure spending, believing Republicans will be loath to vote against it.
"Realistically, to get something that is really game changing, we need to get some legislation," said former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who represented Nevada as a Democrat. "All the eyes of the country are going to be on the Republicans in the Senate."
Before inauguration, lobbyists and environmentalists are watching for early signals about Mr. Biden's direction on climate through his appointments to his transition team and eventually to federal agencies.
Some expect Mr. Biden may devote a White House role to overseeing climate policy across his administration. And some advisers, including former Democratic presidential rival Tom Steyer, are pushing to ensure every cabinet secretary gives priority to measures to slow climate change.
Mr. Biden's campaign has already signaled it wants to avoid having former "leaders at fossil fuel . . . companies" serve on his transition team. But several energy experts from Mr. Biden's inner circle and the Obama administration have ties to the industry, including Amos Hochstein, a former executive at the gas exporter Tellurian Inc., and former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, a board member at utility Southern Co.
The Biden transition team's webpage, published late last week, makes climate one of four priorities and calls its response "The Biden-Harris plan to create union jobs by tackling the climate crisis."

Full text: Joe Biden's election as president raises new questions for a U.S. farm sector whipsawed by turbulent years under President Trump.
Some farmers said they worry a Democratic White House will mean stricter environmental regulations and other restrictions are on the way after the Trump administration eased rules governing water quality, meatpacking-plant operations, genetically engineered crops and greenhouse-gas emissions.
"We have a fear of going backwards," said Richard Guebert, who raises corn, wheat and soybeans near Ellis Grove, Ill., and serves as president of the Illinois Farm Bureau, a trade group.
Mr. Biden's farm policies aim to stabilize U.S. agriculture and open up new markets, his campaign officials have said. Stability could come as some relief: President Trump's tariff battles with major food-importing countries such as China and Mexico at times cut deeply into farm exports and sent commodity markets swooning, battering farmers' income and prompting the White House to boost government farm payments to record levels.
Farmers nevertheless said in pre-election surveys that they supported the president by large margins, perceiving him as an ally against stricter regulations and higher taxes.
Should Republicans maintain a narrow hold on the Senate, Mr. Biden's policy goals could be tempered somewhat.
Rob Larew, president of the Washington, D.C.-based National Farmers Union, said U.S. farmers have not only been grappling with low commodity prices and trade disruptions but also broader challenges such as industry consolidation and climate change.
While a historic cash infusion from the Trump administration has helped shore up some farmers' balance sheets, Mr. Larew said he hoped a Biden administration would adopt a more strategic approach to tackling the farm sector's problems. "Farmers are not in great shape," said Mr. Larew. "It's hard to imagine that the assistance we've seen in agriculture is sustainable."
Mr. Biden's approach to trade negotiations aims to be less combative than his predecessor's. The former vice president has said he would enlist other nations to mount a broader push for fair-trade practices in dealing with China or other countries. That coalition-building could limit China's ability to retaliate with its own tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Mr. Biden's campaign has said, and shield American farmers from market swings.
"China will respond to world pressure," said Tom Vilsack, who served as Agriculture Department secretary under President Obama and helped to craft Mr. Biden's rural platform, in a recent interview. "It's better to give farmers markets, rather than payments."
Hog farmers are hopeful that Mr. Biden will bring the U.S. into a trade pact between Pacific-region nations, which President Trump exited shortly after taking office. Howard "A.V." Roth, president of the National Pork Producers Council and a Wisconsin-based hog farmer, said member countries rank among the world's biggest pork buyers, representing an opportunity for U.S. livestock producers.
Some farmers fear that Mr. Biden's administration will give priority to green initiatives that they say translate to red tape and legal liability on farms. Farmers and agriculture industry officials have held up as an example the Obama administration's 2015 Waters of the U.S. rule, which sought to expand Clean Water Act protections onto more waterways. President Trump's Environmental Protection Agency replaced it with a less restrictive version.
Todd Becker, chief executive of biofuels maker Green Plains Inc., said a Biden EPA may be more favorable to corn-based fuel additives. But major environmental legislation will face hurdles, he said.
"Biden can't make that big of a move because he doesn't have the Senate," Mr. Becker said. "I don't think today there's a path to a Green New Deal."
Mr. Biden has pitched climate-focused policies as a way to protect farmers' crops and livestock from increasingly harsh and volatile weather. Mr. Biden has called for federal funding to pay farmers for climate friendly practices, like avoiding tillage of soil, that help capture carbon in the ground.
Such a program, which also could involve corporations and charitable groups, would help create new businesses to survey and quantify farmers' carbon-capturing efforts, the Biden campaign said.

Full text: President-elect Joe Biden promised on the 2020 campaign trail to undo large parts of President Trump's policies in areas from health care to immigration. He also promised the federal government would play a greater role in combating the coronavirus pandemic.
Much will depend on the makeup of Congress and whether the government remains divided. His more aggressive plans likely wouldn't pass a Republican-controlled Senate. Here's a look at where Mr. Biden stands:
Pandemic
Stimulus: Democrats could pursue at least partially reinstating an extra $600 in jobless aid that expired at the end of July and extend other emergency benefits slated to end Dec. 31. Mr. Biden has also supported providing state and local governments with financial relief so public-sector workers aren't laid off. A divided government would provide Republicans with the leverage to get liability protections for businesses in cases where workers become ill with Covid-19.
Workplace safety: Mr. Biden has said he would push the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish an emergency standard to address worker safety during a pandemic.
Small business: Aid to U.S. small businesses still struggling amid the pandemic is certain to be a priority for Mr. Biden. His platform calls for restructuring the Paycheck Protection Program, including heightened oversight and a provision guaranteeing eligible businesses with 50 employees or fewer would get relief.
Health Care
Affordable Care Act: Mr. Biden would seek to reverse Trump administration changes that have undermined the ACA. He has also called for bolstering the ACA by expanding federal subsidies. He would expand eligibility requirements for Medicare, and backs a public option plan that would let people buy into a government-run insurance plan. His plan would give everyone, including people with employer-provided health coverage, the choice to buy into a public option.
Medicare: Mr. Biden supports lowering Medicare's age of eligibility to 60 years from 65. Doing so would increase Medicare spending overall, but it would shift some people from Medicaid to Medicare, and lower the number of people in employer-provided coverage.
Immigration
Legal immigration: Mr. Biden has signaled he would take steps to ease legal immigration, reversing Mr. Trump's attempts to restrict most legal pathways to the country.
Most of his bolder changes to the legal immigration system would take new legislation, and it isn't yet known if Republicans in Congress would support such efforts. Mr. Biden, for example, has said he wants to provide a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country who lack permanent legal status.
Mr. Biden also wants to increase the number of employment-based visas awarded each year and eliminate country-based caps.
Refugees and asylum: Mr. Biden has committed to taking in 125,000 refugees a year and changing the asylum process. He would reverse the Trump administration's determinations that domestic violence and gang persecution aren't valid reasons for seeking asylum in the U.S.
Immigrant detention and deportation: Mr. Biden would maintain the agency responsible for carrying out deportations, whose abolition has been urged by some progressives in his party. Mr. Biden has promised a 100-day deportation moratorium and has said he would focus only on deporting immigrants with criminal convictions in their home country or in the U.S.
Criminal Justice
Mr. Biden has said his Justice Department would use its power to hold entire cities accountable for police misconduct by conducting far-ranging investigations into police departments, known as pattern-and-practice probes. He has also said his attorney general would advocate passage of legislation lowering the bar for bringing civil-rights cases against police officers and banning the use of chokeholds.
Mr. Biden has said he doesn't want to strip agencies of their funds and would instead boost their budgets for programs like community policing. He is advocating an Obama-era program to employ the broad use of clemency for certain nonviolent and drug crimes and more resources for public defenders' offices.
Tax Policy
Individual taxes: Mr. Biden would keep the tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed in 2017 for households making less than $400,000. He has also proposed tax increases on high-income households. He would raise the top individual tax rate to 39.6%, from 37%, expand the 12.4% Social Security payroll tax, and repeal a 20% deduction for income from pass-through businesses and impose new limits on itemized deductions.
He would nearly double the top capital-gains tax rate to 39.6% for households with income exceeding $1 million. Mr. Biden's plan also includes tax cuts, such as repealing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction.
Corporate taxes: Mr. Biden would raise the corporate tax rate to 28%, impose a minimum tax on U.S. companies and raise taxes on the foreign income of many U.S.-based multinational companies.
Trade
Mr. Trump's election in 2016 led to the biggest shift in U.S. trade policy since World War II. Joe Biden's victory in 2020 could reverse direction again.
Perhaps the biggest difference between a second Trump term and a Biden administration is trade relations with U.S. allies. Mr. Biden says he will woo allies battered by Trump trade sanctions, rethink the use of tariffs and try to create a united front to confront China.
But multilateralism also presents some tough trade-offs. European countries are bound to demand a lifting of steel tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump and backed by Mr. Biden's labor allies.
Mr. Biden has also dangled the possibility that he would join a renegotiated trade pact among 11 Pacific Rim nations, once called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump scrapped on his first working day in office.
Climate
Mr. Biden calls climate change an urgent crisis and has proposed the most aggressive climate agenda of any major presidential finalist. He has promised to keep the U.S. in the 2015 Paris climate accord, and to move the U.S. toward eliminating greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.
He also has proposed spending $2 trillion over four years for projects to help reduce those emissions, to harden infrastructure for extreme weather and to help revive the economy.

Full text: Utilities stocks have been standout performers in the U.S. stock market lately. But not for the reasons that one traditionally might think.
U.S. stocks have been battered by a stretch of turbulence recently, finishing last week with their worst weekly performance since the market rout in March. Given their recent slide -- and expectations for more election-induced volatility ahead -- a move into utilities stocks, a classic defensive trade, would make sense. In reality, however, the outperformance of companies that provide electricity, water and gas started much earlier, with the sector beginning to outpace many of its peers in September.
Since the S&P 500 set its last record Sept. 2, utilities have climbed 7.7%, while other typical safety sectors, such as consumer staples and health care, have tumbled. Meanwhile, safe-haven assets including gold haven't seen a surge in demand, either, with the metal finishing Friday with its worst two-month decline since July 2018.
The utilities sector logged the largest gain in the S&P 500 last month, rising 5% as the benchmark index fell 2.8%. It was the first time since January that utilities were the top performer of the S&P 500's 11 groups, and it came as its other sectors -- excluding communication services -- tumbled for the month.
The isolated rise in utilities shares underscores how the recent gains in the sector are more than just a move to safety. Instead, investors say they are betting that the group will be a key beneficiary if Democratic candidate Joe Biden wins the presidential race thanks, in part, to his green-energy proposals.
"The lift in utilities recently is not related to the historical dividend, safety-seeking rotation that we're accustomed to -- it's a new world," said James McDonald, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Hercules Investments. "If Biden wins, this sector will power forward."
Recent gains in the sector have been led by companies including American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy Corp. and Southern Co., all of which have risen 12% or more since the Sept. 2 market high. The three companies, which provide electricity and natural gas to millions of customers combined, have said that bigger moves into renewable energy are a priority.
For years, large U.S. utilities have been committing to ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions as the threat of climate change has become more glaring and as states have increasingly required companies to generate more of their power from renewable sources.
Already, progress is under way: The U.S. in 2019 consumed more renewable energy than coal for the first time in more than 130 years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said this year.
Yet at the same time, EIA data show, there is still a long way to go. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind still make up only a small piece of the pie when it comes to U.S. electricity generation, with natural gas still in the lead.
Investors are hopeful that Mr. Biden's proposed $2 trillion plan to combat climate change, which includes a goal to achieve zero carbon emissions from the grid by 2035, may further juice utilities stocks. Some are anticipating the potential for an infrastructure package that could include broad incentives for clean energy, including the extensions of current tax credits or the creation of new ones, said James Thalacker, managing director at BMO Capital Markets.
"We think that longer-term, this blue wave, if it happens, would definitely benefit the sector," Mr. Thalacker said, adding that utilities are able to grow their earnings by investing in renewable-energy infrastructure. For many other industries, he said, shifting to renewable energy could come at a cost.
Although a Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress would likely accelerate a clean energy shift, Mr. Thalacker said he remains positive on the space regardless of the election outcome. Despite President Trump's efforts to revive the coal-power industry, an industrywide focus on shifting to greener energy has continued -- in part, Mr. Thalacker said, because of the growing cost-efficiency of renewable energy sources.
Mr. Thalacker points to companies such as NextEra Energy Inc. as an example of the sector's progress. NextEra, now the nation's largest renewable energy company, has had years of rapid growth as it built out wind and solar farms nationwide. The company, which recently made a takeover approach to Duke Energy, is among the best performers in the utilities sector this year, rising 26%. The S&P 500 has risen just 4.3%.
"We think the horse has kind of left the barn on climate change and we see this continuing to gain steam in spite of the election," Mr. Thalacker said.
Although many investors are embracing the possibility of a Democratic sweep, which might increase the likelihood of a robust stimulus package, many acknowledge that Mr. Biden's tax plan could crimp earnings.
Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, agreed the utilities space will likely benefit if Mr. Biden is elected. But he also believes the sector's recent rise is tied to its underperformance since U.S. stocks bottomed this spring. Stocks have charged higher in recent months thanks to fast-growing tech companies: The S&P 500's information technology segment is up 61% from the March 23 market low. The utilities group, in contrast, has risen 44%.

Full text: CUJUBIM, Brazil -- The Amata SA logging company was supposed to represent an answer to the thorny problem of how countries like Brazil can take advantage of the Amazon rainforest without widespread deforestation.
But after spending tens of millions of dollars since 2010 to run a 178-square-mile concession in the rainforest to produce timber sustainably, Amata pulled out in April. The reason: uncontrolled wildcat loggers who invaded Amata's land, illegally toppling and stealing trees.
The Brazilian government of President Jair Bolsonaro had championed such concessions and plans to expand them, arguing that legal logging discourages destructive illegal logging and provides jobs for some of the millions of poor residents of towns on the jungle's edge.Instead of clear-cutting areas, Amata felled an average of only one tree per acre so the forest could regrow.
Illegal logging, instead, opens the path for permanent deforestation, a major risk for global climate.
The vast rainforest's trees soak up and store much of the carbon emissions released around the globe, making it a critical natural brake on climate change, scientists say.
The company's executives in Sao Paulo said that instead of promoting and protecting legal businesses, Mr. Bolsonaro's administration did next to nothing to control the illegal loggers in the western state of Rondonia.
"It's a conflict area," Amata Chief Executive Ana Bastos said. "Those lumberjacks steal our lumber to survive. If we try to stop them, they will fight back. It will be an eternal conflict."
Brazil still plans to expand its logging concessions to 34 from 18. "Our goal is to offer a legal alternative to exploit the forest," said Paulo Carneiro, director of concessions at the Brazilian Forest Service.
Amata's pullout here casts doubt on the country's ability or willingness to find sustainable ways to exploit the Amazon without irreparable damage, some industry executives and environmentalists say.
It also shows that the success of concessions depends on the government's ability to crack down on illegal logging. Since they pay no taxes and make no effort to protect certain species or invest in restoration, illegal loggers can charge $431 per square meter of lumber, compared with $1,511 for legally logged timber, concession operators said.
"It is like having a regular, taxpaying shop competing with lots of tax-free peddlers right in front of your door," said Jonas Perutti, owner of Lumbering Industrial Madeflona Ltda., which also operates concessions in the Amazon.
Illegal loggers repeatedly breached Amata's 93-mile-long perimeter, removing ipe, cumaru and angelim hardwoods, which are prized as far as in China and the Netherlands for use in construction beams, floors and furniture. And it came as deforestation has been on the rise across the Amazon, according to data released recently by Brazil's space agency.
"The organized crime that funds illegal activity in the Amazon -- including deforestation, land grabbing, lumber theft and mining -- remains strong and active," said Carlos Nobre, a Brazilian climate scientist. "It seems [the criminals] aren't frightened by the government's zero-tolerance rhetoric or don't believe it's serious."
The government says it is deploying the military to help police the vast forest as part of a multiagency, antideforestation task force reporting to Vice President Hamilton Mourao.
Illegal logging is thriving in part because the Bolsonaro administration has cut environmental-protection budgets. Here in Rondonia, a state the size of Michigan, there is only about one patrol agent from the Ibama environmental agency per 540 square miles.
"What makes these loggers continue in the forest? It's the certainty of impunity," a government official familiar with Ibama's operations said.
At a gathering in October 2019 of illegal loggers in Cujubim, a town lined with sawmills on the eastern flank of Amata's concession, some spoke openly to The Wall Street Journal about their clandestine trade harvesting hardwoods from the area.
"I spent 30 days in the woods," Claytom Vieira Roberto said, describing his hardscrabble life felling trees. "I've removed some 900 cubic meters [of hardwoods]. In the forest, we work every day. There's no weekend."
Wildcat loggers are among the Amazon's poorest residents, and many feel they have an ally in Mr. Bolsonaro. In his 22 months as president, he has asserted that there is plenty of forest to exploit and publicly expressed affinity for gold miners, wildcat cattle ranchers and others who operate in the forest illegally.
Amata's concession was divided into 24 areas of varying size called Annual Production Units, or UPAs, with only one UPA used by loggers a year. The concession held 600 species of trees, but Amata's license allowed it to harvest just 24. The total annual take was 3,000 trees.
When the Journal visited the Amata site late last year, workers wearing helmets and thick leather shields to protect them from snakebites used GPS devices and satellite maps to find routes into stands of valuable trees.
For men like Orleans Pereira Jr., who had come from a family of wildcat loggers, Amata meant a steady job, solid pay and benefits. "I'm proud of what we do here," the 34-year-old said. "I believe our work isn't destruction."

Full text: Democrat Joe Biden's call during the final presidential debate to transition away from the oil industry injected an energy argument into the closing days of his race against President Trump, which for months had been dominated by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout.
Some Democrats running in oil-rich states distanced themselves from Mr. Biden's comments. Groups opposed to the dangers of climate change cheered them. Mr. Trump, for his part, highlighted the issue in a rally Friday by tweeting a video that his campaign has shown that includes edited clips of Mr. Biden talking about fracking. The practice, which allows oil and gas to be extracted from shale rock, has become a source of friction between the oil-and-gas industry and environmentalists, and some in the Democratic Party have called for banning it.
The exchange during Thursday night's debate added a new wrinkle to a presidential race that while bitter has seemed relatively stable. National polls have shown Mr. Biden, the challenger, with a solid and steady lead, while he has held a smaller advantage in battleground states that Mr. Trump won in 2016. Mr. Biden also holds a fundraising advantage.
During Thursday's debate, Mr. Trump said his challenger's climate-change plan, which calls for the U.S. to have net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, would hurt the oil industry and the U.S. economy. Some energy-industry executives sided with Mr. Trump on Friday, although larger oil companies have at times backed ways to reduce carbon emissions.
"I would transition away from the oil industry, yes," Mr. Biden said Thursday. "The oil industry pollutes, significantly. It has to be replaced by renewable energy over time."
Mr. Trump responded: "Basically what he is saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry." He went on to call out oil-rich states. "Will you remember that Texas? Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?"
After the debate, Mr. Biden told reporters that while he wanted to eventually move away from a reliance on oil, "we're not getting rid of fossil fuels."
"We're getting rid of the subsidies for fossil fuels, but we're not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time," he said.
At a rally in Florida on Friday, Mr. Trump again knocked Mr. Biden for his comments Thursday, asserting they would hurt him in states like Texas and Pennsylvania.
A CBS poll of voters in Pennsylvania in August found those surveyed divided on the issue of fracking -- 48% said they supported it, and 52% said they opposed it. The responses were largely along party lines.
Mr. Biden has proposed barring new oil-and-gas leases on public lands, not a nationwide ban on fracking. Most fracking takes place on state or private lands, so a Biden plan would have a limited impact.
Democratic Oklahoma Rep. Kendra Horn, who flipped her district in a surprise win in 2018, tweeted on Friday: "Here's one of the places Biden and I disagree. We must stand up for our oil-and-gas industry."
Scott Jennings, a GOP strategist and adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said Mr. Biden's comments on the energy industry were a "huge opening" for Mr. Trump, but he said it might be too late to make a significant difference as about 50 million Americans have already cast their ballots. "If you listen closely to Biden last night, it would radically change the American economy," Mr. Jennings said.
Mike Mikus, a Democratic strategist from outside Pittsburgh, said Mr. Biden could have been more articulate in talking about the oil industry, but he didn't think it would change the trajectory of the race. "The people it really motivates on either side of the issue have already picked sides," Mr. Mikus said.
Jim Cassidy, business manager for the Insulators Local No. 2 Union in southwest Pennsylvania, said Mr. Biden's debate comments "didn't sound good," but he is still supporting the former vice president and his position on fracking.
"I cannot see another four years of Donald Trump here," he said. "We're suffering now because of Covid and projects that have stopped."
Mr. Biden's campaign said his position wasn't different from many other politicians'. "The idea of transitioning off of oil is nothing new," deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told reporters after the debate. "Joe Biden has put forward a very aggressive climate plan that will move us into a cleaner economy."
His debate comments could also appeal to younger voters in key states, many of whom consider climate change a priority issue. "Joe Biden is right: we need to transition off of fossil fuels to stop the climate crisis and prevent needless pain and death," said Evan Weber, political director for Sunrise Movement, a group of young climate activists.
Mr. Trump, who has questioned the science on climate change, has worked to boost fossil fuel production. His administration has given priority to deregulation and cutting taxes with the aim of driving economic growth.
Larger oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. favor a carbon tax or some other market-related mechanism to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. But many of the smaller exploration and production companies remain opposed to major climate measures. Chet Thompson, president and CEO of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, said in a statement Friday that transitioning from "oil and natural gas in a few years' time would upend life as we know it and be devastating to the more than 3 million U.S. jobs."
The renewables industry, by contrast, welcomed Mr. Biden's pledge. "Joe Biden stated what is obvious to 90% of voters across America," said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Even with support from the Trump administration, U.S. oil and gas companies have struggled. And recently, Covid-19 has eroded demand for products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel as people travel less. U.S. benchmark oil prices have hovered around $40 a barrel, below the level many companies require to profitably drill new wells.

Full text: If investors had to sum up utility stocks in a word, many would probably say "predictable."
Known for having above-average dividends and stable earnings in all kinds of markets, these investments tend to attract investors seeking to play defense rather than pursue growth.
But some money managers say the sector could become less predictable in coming years, maybe even a little exciting. The global focus on climate change is shaking up the industry, they say, and the U.S. presidential election could shake it up even more.
So far this year, utility stocks have lagged behind the broader market, hurt by a sharp drop in electricity demand in the first half of 2020 amid the coronavirus lockdowns. While the S&P 500 has returned around 8.25% year to date, the utility stocks in the index have fallen almost 1%. The S&P utilities sector had risen 33.7% from year end 2018 to the 2020 high set on Feb. 18.
Some investors say utility shares are still too expensive, but others say the industry is in the midst of a transition that could give utility shares a boost.
Utilities, they say, are pouring billions of dollars into new plants to generate electricity from renewable sources such as wind and sunlight -- and preparing for new demand as the nation's auto and truck fleets shift from running on petroleum products to clean electricity. The move toward renewable power could accelerate if Joe Biden wins the U.S. presidential election in November, analysts say, as the Democratic nominee has proposed extending tax credits to promote the adoption of green technologies.
The result, some of the sector's fans say, is that savings on fuel could enable utilities to boost profits and remain solid dividend payers, even as consumers are spared major increases in electric bills.
"Investors have to think about utilities differently," says Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, which runs a series of energy portfolios, including the $9.1 million mutual fund Tortoise Energy Evolution Fund (TOPTX). "There's more potential for growth than there has been."
U.S. utilities are on course to build 100,000 megawatts of new wind and solar-powered electricity plants over the next 15 years, enough to replace almost 10% of all of the power produced today, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
The expanding roster of power companies vowing to reduce carbon emissions includes Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy, a leader in building wind power plants. Xcel has promised to cut carbon emissions 80% by 2030 and to be carbon-free by 2050. American Electric Power, the Columbus, Ohio-based utility that delivers power to customers in 11 states, has pledged an 80% reduction by 2050, and Edison International, the parent of Southern California Edison, vows to do the same by 2030.
The shift to renewable power in the U.S. would likely speed up if Mr. Biden wins, analysts say. He has pledged to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord as part of a broader $1.7 trillion plan to combat climate change and promised to make electricity carbon-neutral by 2035.
"We have an underweight recommendation on the sector based on fundamental forecasts and price momentum, but that could change with a Biden-Harris victory," says CFRA Research investment strategist Sam Stovall.
Others, however, believe utility stocks are still too expensive. Who is right depends on which metric you look at, says Morningstar utility analyst Travis Miller.
On a price-to-earnings basis, they are expensive. The S&P utility sector was recently trading at about 19 times this year's earnings and 18 times 2021 estimates, compared with 25 times and 20 times for the S&P 500.
But utilities traditionally trade at a discount because of their lower growth rate, which for many investors is offset by their relatively high dividends. Top dividend-paying utilities like Duke Energy, for example, may offer yields above 4%.
If you compare dividend yields in the utility sector to interest rates on investments like bonds, they are historically cheap, Mr. Miller says.
"The returns are good, slow and steady," says Paige Meyer, utilities analyst at CFRA Research in Washington. "That's why Warren Buffett likes utilities."
The industry's biggest challenge will be boosting growth, even if going green helps profit margins, says Ethan Zindler, head of Americas research at Bloomberg NEF. Along with switching to renewable power, the big push on climate has been to make buildings and manufacturing more energy-efficient -- which has pushed electricity usage in the U.S. below 2008 levels, with a sharp drop expected as figures come in for 2020, thanks to the lockdowns, he says.
"The demand numbers haven't fluctuated that much, but more stuff gets built because it is getting cheaper," Mr. Zindler says. "If I had to pick a threat to utilities, it's not overinvestment, it's that demand for the product is not growing."
It all comes down to whether investors, who were used to holding utilities as a no-fuss investment, will be willing to stick with them as they continue to go through wrenching change. And whether utilities, which have been adding renewables rapidly for a decade, can continue to offset the capital costs of new plants with fuel savings, which so far has led to electricity prices for most rate payers declining in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to Labor Department data.
"This transition should translate into earnings and dividend growth," Mr. Miller says. "The key is to get customers on board with any one-time costs that may spring up."

Full text: A decade ago, Crown Holdings Inc. thought it would be risky to share data about its environmental footprint. Now the packaging maker sees it a business imperative.
"There's always that hesitation to be transparent about all of your information," says John Rost, vice president of sustainability and regulatory affairs at the Yardley Pa.-based company. "As we've seen the benefits of being transparent, we've really opened up."
Crown traces its commitment to sustainability back more than 120 years, when founder William Painter invented the bottle cap to extend the shelf life of beverages and reduce waste. But the first sustainability report the company published, in 2011, didn't set any numerical targets for things like reducing greenhouse-gas emissions
Crown says it soon found that the food and beverage firms buying its cans and containers wanted transparency on everything from greenhouse-gas emissions to water use and recycling. As more companies focus on sustainability, they expect their values to be shared by their suppliers, Mr. Rost says.
In its 2019 sustainability report, Crown said it was on track to match all of the electricity used in its U.S. and Canadian beverage plants with wind power by this July. It has since had to adjust that target due to Covid-19 but says it will switch on wind power at the end of this month. Crown also said it has met its goal of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions from direct operations and energy purchases associated with metal-packaging production by 10% from 2015 levels.
The increased disclosure at Crown, the top U.S. company on the environment in a new Wall Street Journal ranking of the world's most sustainably managed firms, underscores how sustainability reporting is capturing the corporate world. Not only are companies facing demands from some investors for data on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and practices, they are being pressured by employees and consumers to focus on issues such as climate change and diversity.
Last year, 90% of companies in the S&P 500 index published sustainability reports, up from about 20% in 2011, according to Governance & Accountability Institute, a New York-based consulting firm.
For companies, creating a sustainability report doesn't come cheap. A big company can expect to invest from $500,000 to $1 million to gather data and produce "a comprehensive report that moves the needle with investors," says Hank Boerner, chairman of Governance & Accountability Institute.
That's only the beginning. Companies also grapple with a tangled web of data requests from investors, standards groups and organizations that rate businesses' ESG performance.
To help investors and consumers sort out how companies are performing on environmental and social issues, The Wall Street Journal created a ranking of the world's most sustainably managed companies. The Journal's ESG research analysts based the list on a review of more than 5,500 publicly traded companies around the world that meet specific disclosure standards. The ranking places a numerical value of 0 to 100 on a company's overall performance across 26 categories of sustainability, ranging from leadership and governance to community engagement and environmental disclosures.
To create its scores, the Journal's ranking used publicly available data and an analysis of media coverage by more than 8,800 sources available via Factiva, a database information service owned by Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. Artificial-intelligence systems supporting the ranking were co-developed with data-service, advisory and technology provider Arabesque S-Ray, which also supplied the company data used for the scores. To qualify for the list, companies need to have publicly disclosed a minimum of 20 data inputs -- at least two per financially material category -- since 2018.
Crown, as well as French miner Eramet SA, pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson and semiconductor firm Texas Instruments Inc., were among the top 25% of companies in the WSJ ranking that reported the most sustainability data.
The ESG ratings business is in its early days, and firms say it's possible to get a good grade from one rater and a poor grade from another. That's partly because raters assign different weights to various ESG metrics, say researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Zurich who reviewed ratings across 924 companies.
Adding to the complexity, ESG standards organizations have multiplied in recent years, and each has a different framework through which companies can format and report sustainability data. Two of the most popular are the Global Reporting Initiative, or GRI, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB. CDP, formerly the Climate Disclosure Project, and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures focus on environmental data.
Johnson & Johnson, No. 43 in the Journal research team's overall ranking and in the top 10 for social-capital management, says it reports via all four of these standards.
"J&J has increased its ESG reporting and disclosure over the past decade to keep pace with the dramatic increase in stakeholder interest and expectations," says Dirk Brinckman, vice president of regulatory law, supply chain & procurement at the New Brunswick, N.J.-based company.

Full text: When Sony Corp. Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida took the helm in 2018, he declared it his mission to ensure the company's long-term sustainability.
Mr. Yoshida stepped into the role after four years of squeezing out costs as chief financial officer, so he understood all of the challenges facing the electronics, entertainment and financial-services giant. After two years of losses, the company had hit rock bottom in 2014, the first year in its history that it failed to pay a dividend, Mr. Yoshida says.
Now Sony is at the top of The Wall Street Journal's list of the 100 most sustainably managed companies in the world. This ranking was produced by the Journal's environment, social and governance research analysts, who assessed more than 5,500 publicly traded businesses based on sustainability metrics in such areas as business model and innovation, external social and product issues, employee and workplace issues, and the environment. The ranking's methodology takes a broad view of sustainability, one which assesses a company's leadership and governance practices for their ability to create value for shareholders over the long term.
Sony got serious about sustainability measures in 2018 as Mr. Yoshida doubled down on generating social value while maintaining high profits at the company, says Shiro Kambe, the company's sustainability chief. Core to Sony's strategy then and now, he says, is working to be part of the solution for sustainability risks at large, and not just for issues it faces within the company.
"For us to continue with this kind of business, the planet and society must be sustainable and healthy. Otherwise, Sony cannot exist," says Mr. Kambe.
Hardware makers like Sony are the most common type of businesses found in the WSJ sustainability ranking, claiming 18 positions in the top 100 list. Hardware companies tend to focus on business areas that our sustainability-management measures weigh heavily, such as supply chain, materials sourcing and efficiency, and product design and life cycle. The next most heavily represented group, chemical makers, with 10 spots, includes Arkema SA and Solvay SA. Semiconductor makers such as Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. took seven spots.
Thanks in part to strong disclosure practices and policies to manage their direct environmental impacts, heavy industry is also well represented. Companies ranked include Japanese glassmaker AGC Inc. at No. 13, French construction materials maker Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA at No. 20 and oil-and-gas companies Eni SpA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC at Nos. 25 and No. 33, respectively.
By country, U.S. companies took 23% of the slots, followed by Japan at 16% and France at 9%. By region, Asian and European companies each garnered 36%, North American 26% and African 2%.
The Journal research team's assessments followed the framework of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, which determines financial materiality of data points for each industry based on categories that are considered reasonably likely to affect the operating performance of a company. Those material categories were given greater weight in calculating the aggregate score that determined a company's rank.
Each company was scored by combining up to 165 company-reported data items with an analysis of media coverage by more than 8,800 sources available via Factiva, a database information service owned by Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. Artificial-intelligence systems supporting the ranking were co-developed with data-service, advisory and technology provider Arabesque S-Ray, which also supplied the company data used for the scores.
For all of the companies, transparency was key. Scores reflect the amount of publicly available information about each company's policies, initiatives and performance metrics -- all of which can be important indicators of a company's long-term financial performance and the effects it could have on the planet and people.
John Bremen, managing director of human capital and benefits at London-based consulting firm Willis Towers Watson PLC, says he has spoken to many companies that wonder why they aren't included in any sustainability rankings. He points to their lack of disclosures. Companies reporting more sustainability data typically find it beneficial, he says.
"Companies that once upon a time were afraid of transparency learned to embrace it, and they actually found this quite a powerful force to help them evolve," he says.
Indeed, making sustainability issues a core part of business practices is a defining characteristic of the WSJ ranking. Around the world for the past decade, many corporations have built out sustainability-related programs, often in response to pressure from customers, employees, regulators and investors. Climate change and inequality are among the biggest concerns, according to interviews with more than two dozen officials at the top 100.
"Companies that are managed in a responsible and sustainable way actually provide a better return and have fewer mishaps along the way," says Frans van Houten, chief executive at Philips NV, the Dutch health-technology company, which took the No. 2 spot in the Journal's ranking.
Philips takes back and resells almost every medical machine in its lineup, including costly diagnostic and interventional equipment. It adopted this practice in the early 1990s both to extend the life of the equipment, through refurbishment, and to offer some customers lower prices without compromising on quality. New imaging machines, for example, can cost millions of dollars.
Issues such as access and affordability, which the ranking addresses under the heading "social capital," are particularly important for companies like Philips, in the medical equipment and supplies industry.
Refurbished Philips equipment plays a key role in a clinic in Grand Rapids, Mich., where Jihad Mustapha, a cardiologist, treats patients with heart and arterial disease. In his office, Dr. Mustapha keeps a photograph of one of his patients, a proud father with his daughter on the day of her wedding. Dr. Mustapha and his imaging machine helped save the man's leg, the doctor says. The clinic bought the system for half the price of a new one, he says, adding that the clinic couldn't have afforded a new one. The same system purchased new could cost as much as $2 million.
At hardware companies, some of the most financially important sustainability issues are sourcing of materials and data security. Sony and Cisco Systems Inc., No. 3 in the ranking, both earned high scores in these areas.
Both companies make devices that gather a lot of information, so data security is a key risk. For Sony, outperformance in data security came about the hard way. After suffering bruising hacks in 2011 and 2014, the company revamped its security systems and became more proactive in guarding against potential threats.
Cisco, in addition to addressing data-security needs, has tracked the environmental impacts of select products over their life cycles since 2008: 91% of the greenhouse emissions associated with its blade servers, for example, comes from the servers' use, while 9% comes from their manufacture, according to Cisco's most recent 2019 sustainability report.
The company received its high WSJ ranking for supply-chain management, product design and data security.
Irving Tan, chief operating officer at the San Jose, Calif.-based network-equipment provider, says Cisco conducts an ecological assessment of targeted products, like popular desk phones, routers and servers, to learn where it can make the biggest difference. Cisco says its products are similar enough that an assessment doesn't have to be done for each one.
Mr. Tan says it is important to pay attention to where a company can make an outsize impact. In Cisco's case, that is sourcing materials and making its products more circular -- that is, how resource-efficient, durable, reusable, repairable and recyclable they are. By 2025, Cisco says it will have standards in place to make sure all of its new products are made with circular design principles.
Cisco has also required 80% of its suppliers -- determined by its spending -- to set emission-reduction targets by 2025 as part of its goal to cut 30% of its emissions from its supply chain, which fall under so-called scope 3 emissions, those coming from both the products a company sells and companies in its supply chain.
"They need to be part of the solution with us," Mr. Tan says.
Other companies, such as Taiwanese electronics maker Tatung and Kering, the French luxury house that owns Gucci, also have been working on quantifying environmental impacts through their products' life cycles.
Kering has developed an app that can be used to calculate the environmental impact of making one of its products -- say, a leather bag. Tatung and Kering were ranked first and second, respectively, in the business model and innovation category of the WSJ ranking, which captures how companies integrate environmental and social factors into their value-creation processes.
Many of the more than two dozen corporate leaders interviewed for the overall ranking say their environmental and social disclosures and programs keep them ahead of the regulatory curve. Spain's Melia Hotels International SA, which operates more than 400 destinations across 40 countries, is No. 7 in the overall ranking mostly because of its environmental programs and disclosure policies, including managing energy, water and ecology at its properties. It has invested more than $15 million in environmental projects since 2016.
Alejandra Sierra De La Rosa, corporate responsibility manager at Melia, says strong sustainability policies save time and money when new regulations arrive. For example, a Spanish law has required sustainability reporting for companies with more than 250 employees since 2018.
Ms. Sierra says some companies had difficulty meeting the rule and had to hire new people, but Melia had already been voluntarily reporting that information since 2008.
"Being ahead of the regulation is definitely a competitive advantage," she says.
Investor pressure is a big reason European companies do better on environmental management, says Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management, a Boston-based investment firm that is focused on climate change.
Ms. Samuelrich points to how European money has made up most of investments into funds that hold stocks based on their environmental performance over the past five years, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc.
"When companies know investors have specific environmental expectations, they tend to improve their practices," she says.
Companies based in Asia have increased disclosure and ESG policies, mostly in response to demands from regional and global investors, says Stefen Shin, principal investment officer for capital markets and structured products at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in Beijing.
Some of the biggest Asian companies in the ranking are South Korea's LG Corp.'s subsidiary LG Electronics, at No. 6, and semiconductor company Samsung Electronics, which landed at No. 28.
Mr. Shin says increased interest in sustainability by Asian companies was bolstered by a decision this year by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to require listed companies to disclose more, and guidance from authorities in Shanghai and Shenzhen. In 2016, Hong Kong's stock exchange also started requiring companies to report ESG data or explain why they couldn't.
As companies in Asia "wake up" to the imminent physical dangers of climate change, such as more typhoons and rainfall, says Mr. Shin, there is a pressing need for those companies "to tackle ESG and sustainability issues."
Globally, trillions of dollars have flowed into investment funds and portfolios that reward and punish companies based on how they manage ESG issues.
Investors view sustainability as a company's ability to generate strong business results while navigating the environmental and social challenges its industry faces today and in the future, from supply-chain disruptions and increased frequency of extreme weather events to growing competition to attract and retain diverse talent.
"What we're trying to understand is whether a company has a sustainable business model or not," says Andrew Howard, global head of sustainable investment at Schroders, a U.K.-based asset manager. "Is this a company that will be able to change and adapt and a company that will be able to thrive in the world that we will be in 10 years from now?"

Full text: A cluster of makers of heavy goods, from steel and cement to glass, leads the companies recognized this year for best practices in managing environmental risk, according to a new ranking by The Wall Street Journal.
It might seem odd for such companies, heavy users of fossil fuels, to rank so high. But these businesses, responding to mounting regulation and pressure from investors to go greener, are working to find balance between environmental responsibilities, growth and profits. The ranking of the world's 100 most sustainably managed companies by Journal researchers seeks to highlight companies that are managing the most financially significant environmental risks effectively.
"Heavy goods are the backbone of society and economic growth -- notably in developing countries -- and will be necessary in the coming decades," says Caroline Le Meaux, head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) research at Paris-based Amundi SA, Europe's biggest money manager. "They can be part of the low-carbon future envisioned by world leaders," she says.
Companies that scored highly in the Journal's environment category include Turkey's biggest maker of iron and steel, Eregli Demir & Celik Fabrikalari TAS, at No. 1; London-listed coal miner and steelmaker Evraz PLC, at No. 2; Japanese steelmaker JFE Holdings Inc., at No. 4; and Japanese glassmaker AGC Inc., at No. 5. Taiwanese shipper Evergreen Marine Corp., which scored well on management of air quality, greenhouse-gas emissions and ecological impacts, took the No. 3 spot.
"Manufacturers need to make a rapid shift to low-carbon and sustainable products or risk obsolescence," says Shaunak Mazumder, fund manager at London-based investment company Legal & General PLC.
The WSJ's ranking is based on more than 5,500 publicly traded companies around the world that met disclosure standards and had policies in place on 26 sustainability categories defined by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. The board is a nonprofit that works with companies and investors to create reporting standards that link sustainability to financial performance.
The effects of heavy-goods makers on the environment are considered by the SASB to be more financially significant than those of companies in other industries, like technology and finance. While the former depend on direct usage of land and water and consume huge amounts of energy, technology and financial firms have less exposure because they are in more of a supporting role to those and other businesses, says David Parham, director of research projects at SASB. Thus, the costs and revenues of the heavy manufacturers are more likely to be affected by environmental issues, and the companies are more likely to encounter regulatory challenges.
Those reasons drove these manufacturers to dominate the top quarter of companies in the environment category.
In addition to companies already named, Germany's HeidelbergCement AG was No. 8, Thailand's Siam Cement Ltd. was No. 9, and Philadelphia-based metal-can maker Crown Holdings Inc. was No. 10.
The overall winner in the environmental category, Istanbul-based Eregli Demir, parent of steelmakers Erdemir and Isdemir, publicly tracks its environmental footprint. Eregli Demir, which declined to comment for this article, says it has invested $675 million in the past three years in sustainability, product development, productivity, R&D, innovation and environment-related projects. It also has planted tens of thousands of trees since 2011. Energy-efficiency upgrades saved nearly $29 million last year and helped cut emissions, the company says in its 2019 sustainability report.
The company has ties to the Turkish military and government. Its single-biggest investor is Turkey's military pension fund, Oyak, with a stake of slightly more than 49%. Oyak, a big investor in industries across Turkey, says it is independent from the military. Oyak was given opportunity to comment but didn't respond in time for publication.
"The methods by which heavy goods are produced and used will ultimately impact our ability to reach a low-carbon state," says Jordan Farris, head of exchange-traded funds at investment firm Nuveen LLC.
The Chicago-based money manager holds Eregli Demir in its Nuveen ESG Emerging Markets Equity ETF, a $46 million fund invested in companies based on their environmental, social and governance practices.
Evraz PLC, No. 2 in the global environment ranking, first set green targets in 2012. The London-listed company operates in Russia, the U.S., Canada, Czech Republic and Kazakhstan. It has invested more than $174 million in projects to cut emissions and boost energy efficiency at its sites. Efforts include switching from coal to burning waste for power and installing collectors of excess gas. It has plans to invest $50 million for environmental works this year, according to sustainability reports. It says it achieved 105.2% recycling of waste from iron and steel production last year -- topping 100% by recycling material previously sent to dump sites -- up from 96.6% in 2010.
For steelmakers like Eregli Demir and Evraz, coal remains a largely irreplaceable ingredient in most steel furnaces, though electric-arc furnaces that burn mainly scrap metal have gained ground. Evraz has five blast furnaces and four electric-arc furnaces, including one in Pueblo, Colo., that should run on solar power by the end of 2021 thanks to $285 million from investors and solar developer Lightsource BP.
"There's still no equal substitute for steel in infrastructure," says Aleksey Ivanov, senior vice president of Evraz, in an email.
Still, Evraz's environmental targets are less aggressive than those of Luxembourg's ArcelorMittal and India's Tata Steel Ltd., says Tom Crocker, research analyst at climate-change-disclosure nonprofit CDP. The two steelmakers didn't make the WSJ rankings due to poorer performance in other sustainability areas.
Mr. Crocker also says Evraz's focus on efficiency upgrades is too incremental. Compared with its peers, Evraz's carbon-intensity target of below two metric tons of carbon-dioxide per metric ton of steel is "highly unambitious" and "not in line with any science-based trajectory and is very short term in nature," he says.
An Evraz spokesman says the steelmaker's senior management held several discussions in March and June on its environmental policy and climate change after the board requested they review the issues. In late June, he says the company completed a climate-change scenario analysis and mapped its risks and opportunities alongside its impacts and mitigation efforts, based on guidelines from the Michael Bloomberg-backed Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the UN.
The move toward consistent science-based climate targets and disclosures, which is the focus of CDP's and TCFD's recommendations, is not explicitly incorporated in the WSJ's scoring methodology, which focuses on sustainability topics considered material to a company's finances, according to the SASB framework.
The only U.S. company in the WSJ environment top 10 is Crown, a maker of metal packaging, including beverage and food cans, with more than 200 plants across 47 countries. Crown scored highly for its management of water, waste and air quality.
All of the electricity used by Crown's beverage-container plants in the U.S. and Canada will be fully matched by wind power this year as it aims for total renewable energy world-wide by 2050. The company also points to how metal is one of the most easily recycled materials.
John Rost, vice president of sustainability and regulatory affairs at Crown, says it is much easier to recycle metal packaging than plastic or glass since there is more infrastructure in place and the material stays in better shape for reuse.

Full text: The U.S. is pulling out of the Paris climate accord, but the biggest U.S. bank is committing to it.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is pledging to use its financing weight to push clients to align with the Paris agreement and work toward global net zero-emissions by 2050. The bank said it would invest in technologies that help reduce carbon emissions and will work with clients to cut their own carbon footprints.
JPMorgan's bankers and advisers hold sway in boardrooms around the globe. The bank plans to argue that combating climate change opens the door to more capital from investors and reduces client risk of becoming outdated.
Other banks have made pledges to stop supporting Arctic drilling and coal companies. British banks NatWest Group PLC (the former RBS Group PLC) and Barclays PLC have committed to using their business to further the Paris agreement, the 2015 deal that called on global governments to curb rising temperatures. Citigroup Inc. earlier this year said it would walk away from clients that aren't taking climate change seriously.
President Trump said in 2017 that he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement, calling the decision "a reassertion of our sovereignty."
For the Paris agreement to reach its goals, JPMorgan said, businesses and investors must figure out how to better measure carbon output and then make improvements that will require massive investment and spending. "We've got to act now," said Doug Petno, the head of JPMorgan's commercial bank.
Climate activists have called on JPMorgan for years to bend its lending power to help the environment.
Protesters have descended on its branches and annual meetings and accosted it for providing banking services to fossil-fuel companies. JPMorgan has some $40 billion in lending exposure to oil-and-gas companies, and the Rainforest Action Network considers it the world's biggest financier of fossil fuels.
JPMorgan said in February it would move away from coal companies, pledged $200 billion in financing for green business and sustainability goals and said its own operations would be carbon neutral this year
It said in February it would move away from coal companies, pledged $200 billion in financing for green business and said its own operations would be carbon neutral this year.
JPMorgan won't end its relationships with oil-and-gas companies, saying the sector remains too important to the economy, and it isn't promising to jettison clients that don't agree with the bank. But the move shows an understanding from the bank that its own carbon footprint extends to the dollars it lends. It plans to focus its new environmental efforts on its clients in energy, automotive manufacturing and electricity generation, where it said it can do the most good.
How JPMorgan achieves the pledge isn't clear or assured.
The bank plans to measure its clients in new ways, including "carbon intensity" metrics that show emissions as a rate of output and that allow easier comparison. What exactly it counts will depend on engagement with clients and outside experts, executives said. It hasn't disclosed how its current portfolio would score as a baseline for how much it has to improve. It will disclose a preliminary 2030 target next year.
The lack of data has long proved an issue, making it hard for environmentally focused investors to score companies' climate records. JPMorgan will push clients for more disclosures on carbon and climate impacts, said Marisa Buchanan, the head of sustainability.
JPMorgan is creating an advisory group to centralize the bank's businesses and industry groups and to engage companies and outsiders on how to structure the work.
"We want to invite voices and companies together and act as a catalyst for change," said Rama Variankaval, who will head what the bank is calling the Center for Carbon Transition.

Full text: BERLIN -- European car makers have an SUV problem: They are selling too many.
Under European Union rules adopted in 2009 to fight climate change, car makers in Europe must cut average carbon-dioxide emissions for their fleet to 95 grams a kilometer this year or face sanctions. It is becoming harder for many auto makers to achieve this level because of the waning appeal of diesel cars, which have relatively low carbon dioxide emissions, a shortage of electric vehicles and now a surge in SUV sales.
"SUVs are useful for helping increase sales and profitability for car manufacturers," said Felipe Munoz, an automotive analyst at Jato Dynamics, a consulting group. But their high emissions mean car makers need new ideas if they are to meet the EU's emission goals.
In Europe, the share of SUVs as a part of total sales is approaching 50% of all new car sales in Europe's biggest auto markets.
And European auto makers have seen a jump in SUV sales.
European regulators began slashing greenhouse-gas emissions from automobiles about a decade ago. They first set a target of 130 grams/km in 2015, moving to 95 grams/km in phases through 2020. From next year, the limit will apply to all new cars sold in Europe.
This pushed auto makers to adapt their offerings. Makers of luxury sedans such as Daimler AG and BMW AG expanded their fleets to include smaller cars. Others tweaked their engines to make them more efficient, resulting in lower emissions.
Consumer tastes, however, have moved in the opposite direction, gravitating toward SUVs that produce considerably more carbon dioxide than smaller cars. As a result, carbon emissions from cars have been rising since 2017. Now, as the European deadline approaches, auto makers are still far from the target.
In the early years of Europe's effort to curb emissions, manufacturers were able to rely on growing engine efficiency as well as regulatory exemptions and loopholes to cut emissions. But as the goal became more demanding, pressure rose to develop new technologies, especially electric vehicles and hybrids.
In Europe, particularly in Germany, car makers also bet on diesel, which emits less carbon dioxide than gasoline. But after Volkswagen AG was exposed for cheating to conceal the amount of hazardous fine particles produced by its diesel engines, consumers turned their back on the technology.
The lack of affordable electric vehicles meant many consumers opted instead for gasoline-powered cars. This shift and the new love affair with SUVs triggered a rebound in carbon emissions.
Electric vehicle sales are rising but remain a niche, with about 7% of the European market.
"If you're a large luxury car maker, this challenge becomes bigger," Daimler Chief Executive Ola Kallenius told reporters this month. "But we are within striking distance of meeting the targets for 2020."
Environmental lobbyists doubt manufacturers' ability and determination to get back on track and warn against any attempt to water down the EU's goals. "At the moment there is a massive cry from industry that the regulation is too hard," said Julia Poliscanova, a senior director at Transport and Environment, a climate lobby group in Brussels. "A lot of the compliance with the emissions targets has been achieved through loopholes and manipulation, so it's very hard to listen to these complaints."
Tracking Europe's automotive fuel mix since 2015 shows that most manufacturers didn't begin deploying electric vehicles and hybrids until recent years, and electric vehicles remain a small part of their overall new car sales.
If they miss the targets, Europe's auto makers face reputation-damaging fines.
There are a few exemptions. Companies can use this year to postpone the reckoning, such as counting electric cars twice in 2020 to reduce emissions. But many of these exemptions can only be used once. That means manufacturers will need to roll out a large number of electric vehicles next year or face the possibility of fines.
At the end of the first six months of this year, Peugeot was the only company that had already met the targets, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation. Unless Volkswagen narrows the gap, it faces potential fines of 3.5 billion euros, equivalent to $4.1 billion, which represents nearly 1.5% of its 2019 global revenue. Daimler, which is the only manufacturer moving further away from the targets, could face a fine of up to 1.4 billion euros.
Undeterred by the pandemic, the European Commission is stepping up its efforts to fight climate change. Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU's executive body would propose slashing the carbon dioxide ceiling for cars to 47.5 grams/km in 2030, from a previous target of 59.4 grams/km.
The only way for the industry to reach this new 2030 target would be for fully electric vehicles to make up at least 60% of new-car sales, compared with 4.3% today, said Hildegard Muller, president of the German Automobile Manufacturers' Association.

Full text: California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an order Wednesday that aims to end the sale of new gasoline and diesel-powered passenger cars in the state by 2035.
It is an ambitious attempt to bolster electric vehicles in the largest car market in the U.S., as well as a bid to tackle emissions that most scientists say contribute to climate change. Transportation is responsible for more than half of carbon pollution in California, the governor said.
More than 11% of all light vehicles in the U.S. last year were registered in California, according to IHS Markit.
California is the first state in the nation to commit to such a goal, but could serve as a spark for other left-leaning states to follow, given its size and historic leadership on regulatory issues. Seventeen countries including France, the U.K. and Germany have adopted goals to phase out internal combustion passenger cars, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit that supports decarbonizing fuels.
Through July, 6.2% of light vehicles registered in California were electric powered and 1.6% in the entire U.S., according to IHS Markit.
"Of all the simultaneous crises that we face as a state . . . none is more forceful than the issue of the climate crisis," Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, said while standing in front of several electric cars. "What we're advancing here today is a strategy to address that crisis head on, to be as bold as the problem is big."
The order also says that, "where feasible," medium- and heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and construction equipment should be zero-emission by 2045.
Mr. Newsom has emphasized climate change as a key cause of the historically disastrous fires that have ravaged the state in the past month. Scientists have said California has become more susceptible to fast-moving, destructive wildfires due in part to a warmer climate, which causes trees and plants to dry out and become more flammable, as well as overgrown forests and an increase in housing in fire-prone areas.
The announcement spurred criticism from the Trump administration. "This is yet another example of how extreme the left has become," said White House spokesman Judd Deere. "They want the government to dictate every aspect of every American's life, and the lengths to which they will go to destroy jobs and raise costs on the consumer is alarming. President Trump won't stand for it."
The Trump administration is already waging a legal battle against California over its special authority to regulate tailpipe emissions, established under the Clean Air Act of 1970. The case is currently before a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.
California's authority to enforce Mr. Newsom's new mandate would come from that same part of the law, likely making it highly dependent on the outcome of November's presidential election, said Bob McNally, a former energy adviser to then-President George W. Bush who is now a private energy consultant.
If Mr. Trump's nominee to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg is confirmed and he remains in office and challenges the order, a conservative majority on the Supreme Court could potentially strike down the California program, Mr. McNally said. If Mr. Biden wins, he likely wouldn't proceed with a case, he said.
In a sign that left-leaning states might follow California's lead on ending the sale of gas-powered vehicles, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown praised Mr. Newsom's announcement. "I will do all I can to accelerate electrification here," the Democrat wrote on Twitter.
John Bozzella, chief executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents U.S. and overseas-based auto manufacturers, said his members are committed to expanding their electric-vehicle offerings, but mandates like the one issued by Mr. Newsom aren't the best way to do so.
"What builds successful markets is widespread stakeholder engagement," among governments, auto makers, utilities, infrastructure providers and others, Mr. Bozzella said in a statement.
A spokesman for Ford Motor Co. said: "We agree with Gov. Newsom that it is time to take urgent action to address climate change. . .. Progress requires public-private partnerships, smart infrastructure a nd key resources that encourage consumers to invest in electrified products."
The order is aimed at new-car sales and won't prohibit Californians from owning or selling existing gas-powered cars, Mr. Newsom said.
The leaders of both houses of California's Democratic-dominated Legislature said Wednesday they support Mr. Newsom's executive order.
"The Assembly looks forward to working with him to pass the necessary legislation to make this bold step land solidly," Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement.
The California Air Resources Board, which has been at the center of most of the state's climate and vehicle emissions policies, will be charged with developing the specific regulations needed to implement the state mandate for passenger cars and trucks.
A shift from petroleum products, such as gasoline and diesel, to electricity will require a new statewide charging infrastructure, and could impact the viability of the state's thousands of gasoline stations. And it will need to upgrade a grid already in need of significant overhaul. The state's electricity grid experienced two days of rolling blackouts last month during a heat wave. The state's largest utilities now routinely shut off large sections of their aging grids to stop their power lines from sparking wildfires on windy days.

Full text: President Trump blamed poor forest management rather than climate change for the unprecedented wildfires engulfing Western states, while Joe Biden focused squarely on global warming and warned of worsening natural disasters if Mr. Trump prevails in November.
Mr. Biden, speaking outdoors in his hometown of Wilmington, Del., said a spate of Western fires, along with a summer onslaught of tropical weather, floods and drought, would become "more common, more devastating, and more deadly" if the president won a second term.
"If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?" Mr. Biden said Monday.
In response to Mr. Biden, Trump campaign spokeswoman Courtney Parella said the Democratic candidate was "saying that the Earth will be destroyed if he's not elected," and that "his lurch to the left is scary enough."
Mr. Trump himself took a markedly different approach Monday during a briefing with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, emphasizing the importance of forest management and raising doubts about the scientific consensus about climate change.
When a top California environmental official said during the briefing outside Sacramento that climate change was a cause of the fires, Mr. Trump said, "It'll start getting cooler. You just watch."
"I wish science agreed with you," said California Secretary for Natural Resources Wade Crowfoot.
The president responded, "I don't think science knows, actually."
Experts say thinning dense forests is the most effective short-term tool to address the fires. The vast majority of scientific experts also say warmer weather across the West caused by climate change has greatly worsened the fire threat.
California, Oregon and Washington state are contending with one of their most dangerous fire seasons in history. More than 3 million acres have burned in California, tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate and nearly three dozen people have been killed.
The wildfires have elevated climate as an issue in the presidential campaign just 50 days before Election Day. Mr. Biden has said he would rejoin the Paris climate agreement on his first day in office and has promoted a $2 trillion plan to tackle climate change. Polling has shown that majorities of Americans want action on climate change.
Mr. Trump, appealing to a conservative base skeptical of global warming, has rejected the scientific community's consensus on climate change and warned that his opponent's policies would lead to the loss of manufacturing jobs and higher energy costs.

Full text: Nearly two years ago, at the age of 56, Janet K. Redman found herself at a personal and professional crossroads after 12 years as a successful financial adviser in Delaware.
Her parents had both recently died. "I had spent the last decade or so staying near them, helping them as much as I could, so their loss really hit me hard," she said. At the same time, she came to terms with how unhappy she was at the financial firm where she worked.
She and the firm agreed to split. "I spent three or four months kind of lost, really trying to figure out what to do," she said. That took her on a journey that would reignite goals she had as a teen for an environmental career.
In December 2018, with savings to keep her afloat, Ms. Redman reflected on her life and career. She loved helping people as a financial adviser. She also recalled a key moment. "I created my own low-carbon footprint [investment] portfolio of companies that had committed to reducing their emissions," she said. "It outperformed the S&P 500 [index] five years in a row."
That triggered recollections of her earlier, thwarted ambitions. When Ms. Redman was 16, she secured a marine-biology college scholarship and used it to enroll in a two-year program at the University of Maryland. But she ended up majoring in marketing and minoring in marine biology, out of practicality.
After college, Ms. Redman landed a job with Bell Atlantic, eventually working her way up to project manager of new technology and platforms. (Bell Atlantic became Verizon Communications after a 2000 merger.) In 2007, Ms. Redman left the company because her division was relocating and she wanted to stay near her parents, as her mother had been diagnosed with cancer.
She applied to the University of Delaware to get a master's degree in marine biology, and was accepted. But she changed her mind after immersing herself in a financial-advisers program at Merrill Lynch while she waited for school to start. "I thought it was either collecting algae in the bay or making a decent living as a financial adviser," she said. She worked in financial advising until June 2018, one week before her 57th birthday.
After her pause, "I made a targeted career move to work on climate change," she said. She was willing to move as her parents had passed away. She was also willing to earn less. "I took a major pay cut to follow the path of working on climate change," she said.
"I met with anyone who would meet with me from the climate arena." she said. "It was exhausting but I didn't know any other way to do it. I had probably sent out I don't know how many hundreds of resumes." She decided to pursue a master's in energy policy and climate.
Ms. Redman interviewed with the Chesapeake Climate Action Network nonprofit for a job but wasn't hired. Later, she saw another posting for an engagement-director position at the network, applied and was hired in December 2019.
"So now, two careers later, I feel like I've come full circle back to what I've always cared about, which was conservation and the environment," she said.

Full text: It has been a stunning fall from grace for Exxon Mobil Corp.
Just seven years ago, Exxon was the biggest U.S. company by market capitalization. It has since lost roughly 60% of its value, with its market cap now at around $160 billion, after the pandemic crushed demand for fossil fuels.
Analysts estimate Exxon will lose more than $1 billion this year, compared with profits of $46 billion in 2008, then a record by an American corporation. The company's removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in late August, after nearly a century on the index, marked a milestone in its decline.
At the heart of the problem: Exxon doubled down on oil and gas at what now looks to be the worst possible time. While rivals have begun to pivot to renewable energy, it is standing pat. Investors are fleeing and workers are grumbling about the direction of a company some see as out of touch and stubborn.
Two years ago, Chief Executive Darren Woods unveiled an ambitious plan to spend $230 billion to pump an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day by 2025. So far, production is up slightly since 2018, but the added spending has weighed down the company, which recently posted two consecutive quarterly losses for the first time in more than 20 years.
Exxon believes the world's growing population will need fossil fuels for decades to come and the company's bet on additional production will yield profits in the long run. Oil demand stalled during the pandemic, but it has been rising for much of the past century.
Exxon's bets could pay off in the long term if oil and gas prices go up later this decade and rivals' lack of investment leaves them unable to capitalize. The company disputed there is discord within its ranks over its direction.
To address risks posed by climate change, it says it is investing in new technologies, including those that capture carbon from the atmosphere or reduce methane emissions, which may help reduce the impact of fossil fuels on the climate. "Our portfolio is the strongest it has been in more than two decades, and our focus remains on creating shareholder value by responsibly meeting the world's energy needs," said Exxon spokesman Casey Norton.
The Irving, Texas, company has shed $10 billion or 30% from this year's capital expenditures, and slowed projects from West Texas to Africa. Dividends are one reason investors stick with oil companies. Exxon has had to take on debt to cover its hefty payouts and some analysts forecast that they may not be sustainable.
Exxon has promised not to cut the payouts, as rivals including Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC have done, or take on additional debt. That has concerned some investors.
"It's one thing to have a lot of confidence and bravado, as Exxon has for years, but when things start getting as tight as they are now, and they are tight, how can you not change your stripes," said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of Adams Funds, which owns 1.6 million Exxon shares.
Rivals such as Shell and BP have also begun investing in renewable energy. In March, Mr. Woods dismissed targets set by those companies and others to reduce carbon emissions as a "beauty competition."
Some employees across the company's operations say its style of management is no longer working in the face of new threats such as climate-change regulations and competition from renewable energy, according to interviews with more than 20 current and former employees.
"While much of your focus has been on a small number of employees who have left the company, we're proud of our 74,000 employees around the world who continue to work hard during the ongoing global pandemic, making significant contributions to [the] company's ongoing efforts to be a market leader," the company said in a written statement.
While other major oil producers have announced more than 35,000 layoffs, Exxon has, so far, announced none. Exxon is suspending matching contributions to U.S. employees' retirement plans starting in October and is conducting a workforce review that may lead to layoffs.
Employees say changes in the company's internal ranking system could mean that thousands of workers are already quietly on the chopping block.
Exxon uses a ranking system to grade employees relative to their peers. It recently changed its formula, increasing the number of U.S.-based employees deemed to need "significant improvement" from at least 3% to between 8% to 10%, according to documents dated April 2020 that outlined the changes.
Employees with low rankings must choose between leaving the company with three months of pay, or entering a three-month probationary period during which they have to meet management targets or be fired.
Mr. Norton, the Exxon spokesman, said, "We do not have a target to reduce headcount through our talent management process." He added the company is conducting a review of potential cost reductions that could lead to fewer managerial roles.
Enrique Rosero, a former Exxon geoscientist who left the company this summer after receiving a low ranking, said he was punished for asking questions about the company's climate strategy. Mr. Rosero was ranked among the top third of Exxon's employees two years ago, according to a document viewed by the Journal, and said he was told by his supervisor in April that he would receive an excellent review this year.
During a town hall meeting that month with senior executives, Mr. Rosero said he asked whether Exxon's acknowledgment that fossil fuels contributed to climate change was inconsistent with its corporate strategy. Several other employees said Mr. Rosero had previously pressed management on such issues.
"We acknowledge the need to reduce our emissions, yet they are set to increase by at least 20% over the next five years," Mr. Rosero said during the meeting, according to Mr. Rosero and several other people who were present. "In the end, wouldn't you agree that this is a problem of behaviors and leadership?"
Tolu Ewherido, a vice president in Exxon's oil and gas production business, responded, "I don't hear a question in there," according to Mr. Rosero and the others present.
Mr. Rosero said his supervisor told him in May that the exchange had come up in a meeting and would negatively impact his employee ranking. In July, his supervisor told him he ranked among the bottom 10% and was given the choice of taking a three-month probationary period or 90 days' pay. He took the pay and left the company on July 21.
Mr. Norton declined to specifically address Mr. Rosero, but said Exxon's review process is fair and based on annual expectations, achievements and patterns of behavior. The number of workers in the "needs significant improvement" category under the company's ranking system is adjusted on an annual basis and "has been as high as 10 percent in prior years," he said.
"We encourage an open dialogue and we do not tolerate retaliation," Mr. Norton said.
Exxon -- the largest direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly -- has struggled through a period of relatively low oil prices for years due to an abundance of oil and gas unleashed by U.S. frackers. After missing out on the beginning of the shale boom, Mr. Woods' predecessor, Rex Tillerson, bet big on projects around the world that mostly failed to meet expectations.
Between 2009 and 2019, Exxon spent $261 billion on capital expenditures, while its oil and gas production remained flat, and it added $45 billion in debt, according to investment bank Evercore ISI. Its return on capital employed in 2009 was 16%; last year it was 4%.
To get into the shale business, Exxon bought XTO Energy Inc. for more than $30 billion in 2010, when natural gas prices were higher than they would be for most of the next decade. Large and risky investments in the Russian Arctic and Canadian oil sands haven't gone as planned.
To reverse Exxon's fortunes, Mr. Woods returned to the company's playbook: investing heavily in mega-projects during a period of low oil prices to catch the upswing. It has spent billions in Guyana and the Permian Basin.
Even before the pandemic, some of Exxon's growth plans in Texas were viewed as unrealistic by some workers, according to current and former employees.
In March 2019, Exxon said it would increase oil and gas production in the Permian Basin to 1 million barrels per day as early as 2024, up from previous estimates of 600,000 by 2025. Some staff assigned to the project thought that was overly optimistic, said six current and former employees.
For one area called the Delaware, some Exxon managers in 2018 had initially pegged the net present value of those holdings at about $60 billion, according to several employees. Some involved in the project estimated last summer that the area's net present value was closer to $40 billion because they believed Exxon was overestimating how quickly it could drill, according to the people. After additional debate and consultation, the value was adjusted to about $50 billion, said the people.
Exxon disputed there had been a significant disagreement over the valuation. The company's "annual planning process considers multiple inputs from multiple working groups across a wide range of complex technical areas," and it is often the case that some experts and managers initially have different views, it said.
In response to the pandemic, Exxon has cut spending in the Permian and lowered its production estimates in 2020 to around 345,000 barrels per day. Prior to that, it was on track to meet or surpass its long-term growth goals there, it added.
"We reject the claims made by your sources who, based on their comments, have an inaccurate, incomplete and dated perspective of resource and development plans," Exxon said in a statement, saying it exceeded the 2019 plans. "Actual performance has proven that their position is inaccurate."
While rivals such as Shell and BP have begun hedging their oil and gas bets with investments in renewable energy, Exxon has remained largely committed to fossil fuels.
In the 1960s, Exxon created an in-house venture-capital division that helped develop some of the first commercially viable solar cells before selling the unit in the 1980s, determining oil and gas were more profitable. Several employees said the company has chosen to primarily innovate on oil- and gas-related technology.
"ExxonMobil is a world leader in carbon capture," the company said.
Mr. Woods has said Exxon is investing in groundbreaking technology, including algae biofuels and capturing carbon. He has also emphasized company traditions, including its employee-ranking system, that he believes have made Exxon successful.
In early 2018, around the time he laid out his growth plan, Mr. Woods visited the company's flagship Houston-area campus for a town hall meeting. He spoke to more than 1,000 employees in the campus' main building, which features a 10,000-ton "floating cube" that appears to hover over a plaza below.
When the meeting shifted to a question-and-answer session, some employees asked about the ranking system and whether Exxon would ever get rid of it, said six people who attended. Many large companies have abandoned such rankings, including Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co., which pioneered the system in the 1980s.
Mr. Woods appeared annoyed by the question and said Exxon would never get rid of the rankings, according to the people.
"We need to win in the marketplace," Mr. Woods said, according to the people.

Full text: Calmer winds and cooler weather Friday helped firefighters battling more than 100 large fires across the West that have killed at least 18 people, burned millions of acres and forced more than 30,000 people to evacuate in Oregon.
One of the most dangerous blazes was the 130,000-acre Riverside Fire, which erupted amid a windstorm in the Mt. Hood National Forest in Oregon on Tuesday and has raced down the mountains to threaten the outer suburbs of Portland, the state's largest city. The inferno prompted alerts for more than half of the 420,000 residents of Clackamas County to prepare for possible evacuations.
Oregon Gov. Kate Brown's office said a half million people, about one-eighth of the entire state's population, were told to prepare for possible evacuations.
In neighboring California, where a record 3.1 million acres have burned so far this year, crews were using the calmer weather Friday to try to build more containment lines, according to the state's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.
Record temperatures and strong winds this past week helped the fires in California to spread quickly, while forests full of hundreds of millions of trees dried out by climate change and beetle infestations have proved to be perfect fuel.
As of Friday, at least 12 people had died and 3,500 structures had been destroyed in California wildfires that started in mid-August with rare lightning storms, the remnants of two tropical storms that had drifted across Northern California. The deadliest is the 250,000-acre North Complex of fires, which flared up during the windstorms earlier this week and tore through a number of small communities including Berry Creek, where many of the victims were found.
A second round of fires exploded this week after more record-setting temperatures in the south and north of the state. Offshore winds from a passing low pressure system to the east made them spread quickly, said National Weather Service meteorologist Drew Peterson in Monterey.
Cal Fire officials said Friday the smoke layer covering much of Northern California would actually help firefighting efforts by maintaining cooler temperatures into the weekend, and that an onshore flow next week would boost humidity.
Gov. Gavin Newsom toured fire damage on Friday in Butte County, near the site of the devastating 2018 Camp Fire. He said the state was receiving help from fire agencies across the country and internationally, including from Israel and Canada.
Mr. Newsom said while forest-management issues are a factor in the current crisis, the largest contributor is climate change.
"The reality is the megafires that we're experiencing come from these megadroughts that we've experienced," he said. "What we're experiencing right here is coming to communities all across the United States of America unless we get our act together on climate change."
About 11 million Californians, roughly a fourth of the state's population, live in what foresters call the "wildland-urban interface," close to highly vegetated areas that easily burn, according to a 2018 report by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In southern Oregon, two people were killed and an estimated 700 homes were destroyed along an approximately 10-mile corridor of Interstate 5 by the Almeda Drive fire, which authorities said they are investigating as arson.
At least three other deaths and 500 destroyed structures have been reported in other state fires, although Ms. Brown, the Oregon governor, said she expects those figures to grow.
"I want to be upfront in saying that we expect to see a great deal of loss, both in structures and human lives," Ms. Brown said at a news conference Thursday. "This could be the greatest loss of human lives and property due to wildfire in our state's history."
Koko Petitt, a 29-year-old high school English teacher, left work early Tuesday and made a beeline to her rented townhouse in the southern Oregon town of Phoenix. She managed to pack a suitcase of clothes, a few shoes and one of her grandfather's wildlife paintings before heading to her parents' house in nearby Medford.
The row of townhouses tucked into the woods is now decimated by a fire.
"I saw a video of what it looks like and it's just unrecognizable. I can't even tell which one was my townhouse," Ms. Petitt said. "I can't believe I woke up on Tuesday thinking my biggest concern was preparing for the new school year. And now my house is gone and, more importantly, most of the town."
President Trump on Friday approved the governor's request for federal emergency disaster aid, freeing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts on the ground in Oregon.
Chad del Rosario, a cannabis farmer in the rural Oregon town of Rogue River, has been waiting and watching as thick clouds of smoke hover over his 86-acre property.
"There's not like one fire that I'm watching. There's multiple," he said. "I'm just kind of surrounded by it."
Weather forecasters said conditions for firefighting were greatly improved Friday.
"The conditions are definitely better with the lighter winds, and humidities have come up," said Jeff Lorber, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Monterey, Calif.
In Washington, a 1-year-old child died in the Cold Springs Fire in Okanogan County, in the north central part of the state, according to Gov. Jay Inslee. The child's parents also were hospitalized. The Cold Springs Fire has consumed at least 174,000 acres, and more than 580,000 acres have burned throughout the state, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
The air was hazy and difficult for people with respiratory conditions to breathe throughout much of the West Coast on Friday, as smoke from fires spread all over the region.
Even Los Angeles, hundreds of miles south of the biggest fires, is seeing fouled skies in the surrounding mountains. The air in the city ranked seventh worst in the world Friday morning, according to the website IQAir. Portland, Seattle and San Francisco held the top three spots, dislodging cities such as New Delhi and the Pakistani city of Lahore.

Full text: The American West is facing one of the most dangerous and overwhelming fire seasons in history due to high temperatures, strong winds, dry forests and lightning storms.
The outbreak began in mid-August, when remnants of two tropical storms drifted across Northern California, unleashing almost 15,000 lightning strikes onto forests and brush that had already been withering under the hottest temperatures on record for that month.
The lightning sparked hundreds of fires across the region, including three around the San Francisco Bay Area that rank among the largest in acreage in state history.
A second round of fires exploded this week after more record-setting temperatures in the south and north of the state. Offshore winds from a passing low pressure system to the east made them spread quickly, said National Weather Service meteorologist Drew Peterson in Monterey, Calif."The table was set for extreme fire conditions," Mr. Peterson said.
In addition, many forests throughout the West suffer from a buildup of excess timber because of policies to stop fires as quickly as possible, rather than letting them burn, and logging restrictions pushed by conservationists.
So when the fires hit, they chewed through dead and weakened timber at unprecedented speed.
The most effective short-term tool is to thin the surrounding forests, thus depriving fires of fuel. But the job is monumental and experts say that despite a big ramp-up in brush cutting and controlled burns, California and other Western states are behind where they need to be.
The work is constrained, in part, by the fact that the forested land in California sits on state, federal and private land, making coordination difficult. In addition, thinning projects like planned burns often are fought by neighbors, said Ken Pimlott, retired chief of Cal Fire. And then, even after the thinning is done, it has to be maintained as new vegetation grows back.
"The enormity of this challenge is so large and these fires just keep growing in intensity," Mr. Pimlott said.
The problem has only worsened this year as Covid-19 safety concerns prevented California from going through with some controlled burns planned for the spring.
The vast majority of scientific experts say the warming climate has greatly worsened the fire threat. Tropical storms Fausto and Genevieve moved farther north in the Pacific than they otherwise would have because of the warmer waters, setting up the rare lightning outbreak in August, said Wally Covington, emeritus professor of forestry at Northern Arizona University.
Ridges of high pressure that block moisture in the desert Southwest have grown stronger due to climate change, too, he added. That has contributed to temperature spikes.
As a result, the vegetation is uniformly much drier than it has been in more than a century, allowing fires to plow through everything from the Joshua tree forests of Southern California's Mojave Desert to the redwoods near San Francisco, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
"There is a sustained background warming all the time, causing that extra evaporation from the soil that is making water not available to plants," Mr. Swain said. "It is shocking, but not completely unexpected."
Normally, rays of sunlight are scattered by very small micro-particles, such as molecules of oxygen and nitrogen, creating the familiar daytime canopy of blue overhead, in a process called Rayleigh scattering. That's because those molecules scatter short wavelengths of blue light more efficiently than the wavelengths of other colors, according to NASA and the U.K.'s Royal Society of Chemistry.
Larger smoke and ash particles, like those from wildfire combustion, instead scatter the longer wavelengths of red light, while blocking the shorter wavelengths of yellow, blue and green, in a process known as Mie scattering.
That's exactly what happened in the San Francisco Bay Area this week, after fires in the region shot intense updrafts of smoke and ash into the upper atmosphere as high as 50,000 feet, about 20,000 higher than the cruising altitude of many jet airliners.

Full text: GRUNDY COUNTY, Tenn. -- For much of human history, the way to make money from a tree was to chop it down. Now, with companies rushing to offset their carbon emissions, there is value in leaving them standing.
The good news for trees is that the going rate for intact forests has become competitive with what mills pay for logs in corners of Alaska and Appalachia, the Adirondacks and up toward Acadia. That is spurring landowners to make centurylong conservation deals with fossil-fuel companies, which help the latter comply with regulatory demands to reduce their carbon emissions.
For now, California is the only U.S. state with a so-called cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce greenhouse gasses by making it more expensive over time for firms operating in the state to pollute. Preserving trees is rewarded with carbon-offset credits, a climate-change currency that companies can purchase and apply toward a tiny portion of their tab.
But lately, big energy companies, betting the idea will spread, are looking to preserve vast tracts of forest beyond what they need for California, as part of a burgeoning, speculative market in so-called voluntary offsets.
One of the most enthusiastic, BP PLC, has already bought more than 40 million California offset credits since 2016 at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Last autumn, the energy giant invested $5 million in Pennsylvania's Finite Carbon, a pioneer in the business of helping landowners create and sell credits. The investment is aimed at helping Finite hire more foresters, begin using satellites to measure biomass and drum up more credits for use in the voluntary market.
BP has asked Finite to produce voluntary credits ASAP so they can be available for its own carbon ledger and to trade among other companies eager to improve their emissions math. As part of its shift into non-fossil-fuel markets, BP expects to trade offset credits the way it does oil and gas.
"The investment is to grow a new market," said Nacho Gimenez, a managing director at the oil company's venture-capital arm. "BP wants to live in this space."
By paying landowners not to cut, companies can say they are responsible for having locked up a specific amount of carbon in the standing trees, calculable to the metric ton. It's great for public relations, meeting carbon-reduction targets and courting investors who are shoveling money into funds that promise to invest with ecological and social responsibility in mind.
Old-growth forests are also a defense against wildfires, because they are less susceptible than the scrubby growth that fills in after a clear-cut.
Skeptics contend the practice does little to reduce greenhouse gases: that the trees are already sequestering carbon and shouldn't be counted to let companies off the hook for emissions. They argue that a lot of forest protected by offsets wasn't at high risk of being clear-cut, because doing so isn't the usual business of its owners, like land trusts, or because the timber was remote or otherwise not particularly valuable.
"It isn't adding to the carbon balance one jot," said Duncan McLaren, a Lancaster University professor who studies climate engineering. "What it is doing is validating the emissions."
This trade in standing trees is the latest market-based effort to curb pollution. Cap-and-trade was deployed to reduce acid rain after President George H.W. Bush signed amendments to the Clean Air Act that limited sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants. Lawmakers during the Obama administration pitched a federal cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gases and slow global warming, but the plan stalled amid debate over costs and its effectiveness in dealing with a world-wide problem.
California forged ahead, setting caps on emissions, which become stricter over time, and creating a corresponding number of allowances. Refiners, fuel importers and utilities vie for the allowances at auction and turn them over to regulators to cover their emissions. Quebec linked its own program with California's in 2014. The European Union operates a separate emissions trading program.
The companies have the option of covering up to 4% of their emissions with less-costly offset credits, which California issues for capturing methane from dairies and mines, destroying ozone-depleting substances and, most popularly, preserving forests.
About 153 million forest credits have been issued, each representing a metric ton of sequestered carbon. They limit logging on about five million U.S. acres. That's a sliver of the 740-million-odd acres of U.S. forests and woodlands that aren't already reserved, but the amount of offset-protected property is growing fast.
More than $1 billion has been paid to U.S. woodland owners not to cut, said Sean Carney, Finite's president. The most prolific of forest-offset firms, Finite has represented timberland owners including Maine's Passamaquoddy tribe, a Danish pension fund, a West Virginia coal concern and investment firms like the The Lyme Timber Co. Finite is surveying tracts in Minnesota's frigid peatlands, along Tennessee's Cumberland Plateau and elsewhere that will add hundreds of thousands of acres.
If other governments join California and institute cap-and-trade markets, voluntary offsets could shoot up in value. It could be like holding hot tech shares ahead of an overbought IPO. Like unlisted stock, voluntary credits trade infrequently and in a wide price range, lately averaging about $6 a ton, Mr. Carney said. California credits changed hands at an average of $14.15 in 2019 and were up to $15 before the coronavirus lockdown drove them lower. They have lately traded for about $13.
These days, voluntary offsets are mostly good for meeting companies' self-set carbon-reduction goals. BP is targeting carbon neutrality by 2050. Between operations and the burning of its oil-and-gas output by motorists and power plants, the British company says it is annually responsible for 415 million metric tons of emissions.
Finite was launched in 2009 by Mr. Carney and financial backers in anticipation of a shake-up of forest economics.
He was raised in the woods along the West Virginia side of the Ohio River, where his father worked for a coal company. He left for the University of Southern California and immediately missed the trees. "Like landing on the moon," he said.
Finite didn't earn a penny for four years. Mr. Carney gave up pay. He and other Finite employees traveled to the far corners to tell landowners about the coming carbon market.
Tribes and land trusts were early converts. In 2013, when California began issuing offset credits, Finite was at the front of the line with 19,104 trust-owned acres in eastern Maine.
Maine's Passamaquoddy raised more than $30 million enrolling 98,532 acres. The tribe used the money to refinance its wild-blueberry business, build a sugar shack for its maple syrup operation, fund a housing program, start a suboxone clinic to fight opioid addiction and, when the coronavirus lockdown hit, stock the local food pantries, said Corey Hinton, a lawyer for the tribe.
BP paid more than $100 million to Alaska Native corporation Sealaska Corp. to manage 165,077 acres under California rules.
Nonbelievers came around. "I once had a landowner tell me the first evidence he saw of climate change was the first check he got from Finite Carbon," Mr. Carney said.
Charleston, W.V.'s Rowland Land Co. was swayed by low hardwood prices. Though prices for softwood lumber, which comes from evergreens and is used to frame homes and for fences, have climbed to records this summer, lumber from deciduous trees hasn't sold for so little since the housing crash. Rowland started out logging in 1886 but discovered coal in 1902.
"We've been mining coal for a long time and, like most land companies, we see the light at the end of that tunnel," Chief Executive David Pollitt said. "Pretty soon the coal will deplete and we'll be a timber company again."
California issued Rowland 1.9 million offsets covering 35,466 acres of mostly poplar and oak, a big boost during a period of poor prices for Appalachian coal. Plus, the offsets won't prevent Rowland from cashing in on fads in furniture, cabinetry and flooring.
Sellers can selectively cut so long as the felled trees' mass is less than what their woods have added since offsets were issued. Or they can sell additional credits against the growth.
Molpus Woodlands Group LLC of Jackson, Miss., is among the country's largest timberland investment-management organizations. Those are basically buyout firms, but for woods instead of companies. Molpus has century-old roots in a lumberyard, supplied ammo boxes for World War II and in the 1970s ran one of the country's largest sawmills. Now it is cranking out offsets.
Working with Finite, Molpus has produced offsets in Kentucky, Tennessee and twice in New York's Adirondacks. It is in the midst of registering California credits in Minnesota and on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
A March trunk-measuring in Minnesota was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic and will have to wait until the bogs freeze again. The 167,174 acres near the Canadian border are poised to generate north of $30 million for Molpus investors, said Dick Kempka, who worked for conservation groups before joining in 2017 to wring nontimber income from its lands.
"We're seeing more and more value from having the trees stay there longer," he said.
Offering an income-producing alternative to logging so that trees could remain standing and absorbing carbon motivated California's decision to accept forest credits, said Andrea Tuttle, who helped develop the program when she led the state's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. So far it has worked, thanks to strict criteria involving third-party verification and audits every six years, she said.
"We can show accrual of carbon," she said. "We can demonstrate it through measurements because trees stand still and we can put a tape measure around them and show that they have grown."
That's why Tim McAbee, who leads project development for Finite, was recently in the middle of nowhere, Middle Tennessee. He and two freelance foresters needed to measure trees deep in Lyme's woods to determine how much carbon is sequestered on its property and thus how many offset credits the firm can sell. The trees were around points chosen randomly by a computer on Lyme's 18,369 acres. Accessibility wasn't considered.
They donned hard hats and orange vests and set off into thick and thorny woods for an hourslong trudge toward the trees they had to measure. They found a stub of painted rebar surrounded by trees numbered to 10 in matching blue. The white ash, black oak, red maple and sassafras were striped 4 1/2 feet up their trunks where another crew had measured their girth months ago.
David McMath, who lives in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, stepped up to No. 1, pulled a length from the girthing tape dangling from his vest and hugged the hickory.
Cole Parsons, a West Virginian who followed his father into forestry, paced away from No. 1 and pointed a laser hypsometer at its trunk and then up at its crown to gauge the tree's height.
The difference between evaluating trees for cutting and carbon is precision. Tenths of an inch in diameter or a few feet in height matter when calculating sequestration. Saplings that would be wasted in logging are factored in.
All the measuring adds up. Registering typical terrain costs about $350 per plot, and there can be hundreds of them, he said. In Alaska, where helicopters and bear guards are needed, it runs around $1,000.
Finite hopes to reduce costs by replacing some of the legwork with satellites and artificial intelligence. It is launching an online platform for owners to register as few as 40 acres in the voluntary market.
Lyme, which is considering voluntary offsets for a $300 million tract on Michigan's Upper Peninsula that it bought last autumn from timber giant Weyerhaeuser Co., seeks forests made marginally economical by rugged terrain or mill closures and sells offsets to cover much of the purchase price. That reduces the urgency to turn woods into wood, said Jim Hourdequin, the Hanover, N.H., firm's CEO.

Full text: WHERE DO DEMOCRATS STAND ON CLIMATE POLICIES? The party's convention this week left some environmentalists confused and concerned about the path the party plans to take if it wins the presidency and the Senate, with key policy makers contradicting each other on policy prescriptions. The party's left flank used a side session on climate change to make the case for why the Green New Deal is necessary and popular, even in purple districts and swing states. But in a bid for party unity, Sen. Bernie Sanders noted in his keynote address Joe Biden's plan to transition to 100% clean electricity in the next 15 years, slightly slower than the Green New Deal's timeline but still generally praised by environmental groups.
Starker gaps developed not between Biden and the left, but Biden and the party's own platform. Biden's climate plan, along with the Biden-Sanders unity task force and the 2016 party platform, called for ending subsidies for fossil fuels. Yet that provision was struck from this year's platform, a move condemned by environmentalists and members of the 2016 platform committee. "Hoping this was just a mistake, because ending fossil fuel subsidies is a no-brainer," said Bill McKibben, who helped write the 2016 language. Greenpeace USA graded the party's platform a C+, in contrast to their B+ grade for Biden. The American Petroleum Institute has long argued that tax policies that allow oil and gas companies to write off certain production costs are needed to "close the income gap and create jobs."
Biden "continues to be committed to ending U.S. fossil fuel subsidies," said Biden policy director Stef Feldman, emphasizing the gap between the campaign and the party platform.
Reading the tea leaves: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee spoke at the climate session and said he was "tickled pink he could stay home and be with his grandchildren," rather than come to Washington, D.C., as president, after his primary campaign sputtered. Some climate hawks would like to see him come in a Biden administration, perhaps as Interior secretary.
OHIO REPUBLICAN Rep. Mike Turner tries to turn a scandal for the state GOP against his Democratic opponent, Desiree Tims. Turner, a nine-term congressman, was outraised during the last quarter by Tims in his Dayton-area district, which President Trump carried by 7 points in 2016. His new ad tries to tie Tims to the recent racketeering indictments of Ohio GOP leaders, including statehouse Speaker Larry Householder, by noting that she has received donations from individuals in New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and was a registered lobbyist. Tims lobbied for the League of Conservation Voters. None of the donations to her campaign or her work as a lobbyist was related to the Ohio GOP scandal, in which everyone charged has pleaded not guilty save Householder, who hasn't entered a plea.
"Republicans using a huge GOP scandal against a Democrat is . . . something," said nonpartisan election analyst Nathan Gonzales. A Tims spokeswoman dismissed the ad as "cheap campaign tactics."
POLITICAL ADVERTISING ON Google is up nearly 11-fold from 2018, and presidential campaign ads account for roughly 75% of that spending, according to an analysis by progressive group Tech for Campaigns. In the period May 24 through July 12, the Trump campaign outspent Biden $15 million to $8.6 million on Google ads. The type of ads each party buys differs sharply: 82% of the growth in image ad spending came from Republicans, while 61% of the growth in video ad spending can be attributed to Democrats.
NANCY PELOSI TAKES SIDES in the Massachusetts Democratic Senate primary, endorsing Rep. Joe Kennedy III over Sen. Ed Markey. The race has scrambled the usual progressive-moderate battle lines, with Progressive Caucus members like Reps. Pramila Jayapal, Mark Pocan and Raul Grijalva endorsing Kennedy along with moderates like Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. Markey has arranged an unusual coalition featuring the center-left Boston Globe editorial page, along with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a stable full of Bernie Sanders-aligned organizations.
LET'S VOTE ALREADY: Interest in the election has reached record highs, according to the latest WSJ/NBC News poll, with 79% of voters describing their interest level in the election at a "9/10" or higher, up 2 points from July. At similar points in 2008 and 2012, those numbers were 72% and 68%, respectively. The previous high point in recent elections for summer enthusiasm was 73% in 2004.
REPUBLICANS WERE FEATURED HEAVILY at the Democratic convention, as Biden tried to make the case for a big-tent approach with testimonials from former John Kasich, Colin Powell and others. No Democrats have yet been announced as speakers at the Republican convention, though there have been discussions about including some. One notorious "Trumpocrat" will be doing his part from the sidelines, though: former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, pardoned by Trump this year, will host a fundraiser and watch party for a GOP state Senate candidate during Trump's acceptance speech. Tickets start at $150.
MINOR MEMOS: Amid Postal Service controversy, retired Sen. Orrin Hatch pays homage to his favorite postal worker: Utah Jazz Hall of Famer Karl "The Mailman" Malone . . . . Surplus of signed merchandise? Trump campaign offers $10 off Trump-signed photos . . . . Sen. Elizabeth Warren plants "Easter eggs" behind her during DNC speech broadcast from a classroom, including blocks spelling out "BLM," tributes to Massachusetts authors and companies, and a child-size postal worker smock.

Arctic Refuge Put Into Play for Drilling --- U.S. interior secretary clears way for auctions of oil leases in remote wilderness in Alaska

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration approved an oil leasing program for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, opening up the pristine 19-million-acre wilderness to drilling for the first time and making it difficult to unwind the decision should Democrats recapture the White House in November.
Approving the program on Monday clears the way to auction oil leases "right around the end of the year," Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview. The decision caps more than 30 years of efforts by oil companies and Alaskan leaders to drill in the refuge.
Environmentalists have raised concerns about the impact drilling could have on the polar bears and caribou herds that live in the remote refuge in northeast Alaska. Congress passed a mandate to lease oil rights in part of the refuge in its tax overhaul in 2017, when both the House and Senate were in Republican control.
Mr. Bernhardt said that the drilling can be conducted in an environmentally sound manner and that Congress has set details into law that will help the plan withstand challenges from environmentalists.
"Congress gave us a very clear directive here, and we have to carry out that directive consistent with the directive that they gave and consistent with the procedural statutes," Mr. Bernhardt said. "I have a remarkable degree of confidence that this can be done in a way that is responsible, sustainable and environmentally benign."
The refuge, often known by its acronym ANWR, is nearly the size of South Carolina, nestled between the Arctic Ocean to the north and Canada's Yukon to the east. Congress made its protections law in 1980, and its expansive tundra, mountains and coastal plain are still nearly void of people and roads.
Investors question its value, however, as a source of oil, especially in an era of lower crude prices and tepid demand. The industry is glutted with supply world-wide, pushing companies of all sizes to plan deep spending cuts.
The reserves in ANWR are uncertain and drilling there is unpopular with the public, according to a recent survey by Yale University. Combined with the sheer expense of entering Arctic wilderness for the first time, it might all chase away several of the major companies that could afford such a capital outlay.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. are among several banks to rule out funding for ANWR drilling specifically, and more have broadly ruled out financing for Arctic development.
BP PLC, a pioneer of Alaska oil, decided last year to sell all of its assets in the state even with an ANWR auction pending -- only to see the deal temporarily delayed this spring while falling oil prices caused major banks to balk at financing the buyer, Hilcorp Energy Co.
Financiers are concerned about climate change and low oil prices, and that is likely to keep oil companies from lining up to drill in the refuge, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc., which manages more than $1 trillion in assets.
"Investors, with the energy companies, they don't want a backlash from university endowments, sovereign-wealth funds and so on," Ms. Krosby said. "But, more importantly, I go back to the economic fundamentals: Why do you have to go there for oil? . . . The optics at this stage don't bode well for this sort of endeavor."
Mr. Bernhardt reiterated the department's assertion that oil drilling can be done in the coastal plain along the Arctic Ocean, at the northern tip of the refuge, without spoiling the area. The Interior Department said drilling pads, processing plants and roads needed for drilling will take up 0.01% of the refuge's 19 million acres.
Pipelines that hover over the ground, however, are largely not counted toward that limit. Environmentalists contend the area should remain in a wild state and have held out hope that drilling could be averted if Democrats gain the White House or attain a majority in the Senate.
Oil development threatens wildlife and is likely to worsen climate change, according to the Alaska Wilderness League, one of the groups that has opposed opening the Arctic refuge to drilling.
"Our climate is in crisis, oil prices are cratering, and major banks are pulling out of Arctic financing right and left," Adam Kolton, the group's executive director, said in a statement Monday. "This rush to drill would culminate in a fire sale of our nation's most iconic wilderness."
Congress gave the Interior Department until December 2021 to sell oil leases. Doing so this year, locking the government into contracts with companies, would make it harder to delay or undo the plan for drilling in the refuge even if Democrats who oppose the plan come into power, lawyers have said.
Mr. Bernhardt said all environmental laws were scrupulously followed, but he also said the department moved quickly given President Trump's support for boosting U.S. energy production.
"We take our direction from the president. The president has been very robust on opening additional areas of federal lands, as appropriate, to resource development," Mr. Bernhardt said. "We've tried to hit his priorities as expeditiously as we can -- with appropriate deliberation."
Kara Moriarty, leader of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, emphasized that drilling is limited to the coastal plain and said production is likely 10 years to 15 years away even with a lease sale this year.
"For Alaska, having continued oil and gas development for the next 30, 40, 50 years is imperative to the state's economy," she said. "And, yes, there's oil everywhere, but . . . we have the strongest environmental regulations. I'd put them up against any others in the world."

Full text: On a green swatch in the Arizona desert, a 30-ton robot is scrutinizing plants that could help feed impoverished countries and fuel American cars.
The 70-foot-tall colossus, called a "Field Scanalyzer," is the world's biggest agricultural robot, the project's researchers say. Resembling an oversize scaffold with a box perched in its middle, it lumbers daily over 2 acres of crops including sorghum, lettuce and wheat, its cluster of electronic eyes assessing their temperature, shape and hue, the angle of each leaf.
The Scanalyzer beams this data -- up to 10 terabytes a day, roughly equivalent to about 2.6 million copies of Tolstoy's "War and Peace" -- to computers in Illinois and Missouri. Analyzing the range and depth of data generated is possible only with machine-learning algorithms, according to data scientists at George Washington University and St. Louis University, where researchers are teaching the computers to identify connections between specific genes and plant traits the Scanalyzer observes.
Deep learning, a form of AI that uses conclusions from data to further refine a system, can also help pinpoint how some varieties of a plant may subtly differ from one another in ways that plant scientists may not anticipate, researchers say.
The effort -- part of a five-year, roughly $26 million project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation -- is aimed at helping plant breeders identify characteristics and genetic markers pointing to the most efficient and resilient crop varieties. Researchers are seeking to develop crops that can produce biofuels, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. It could also help identify food crops that can thrive in drier, hotter conditions as climates change.
"There are opportunities here to figure out the things that are most important, things we didn't know before, or different combinations of features," says Abby Stylianou, assistant professor of computer science at St. Louis University, who is developing machine-learning models for the project. "Maybe it's wide and hot leaves that correspond to some particular output you care about."
The data sets are also being used to test-drive AI tools that could be applied to research into human aging or disease progression, says Robert Pless, chair of computer science at George Washington University, who has worked on the Scanalyzer's data from the project's beginning.
Some agriculture companies already are incorporating AI into their decadeslong efforts to produce better-performing seeds for farmers: Bayer AG, the world's largest crop seed supplier, says it has developed a self-teaching algorithm to predict crop seeds' performance, helping the company expand its corn seed development pipeline by four times versus 2012 levels, and soybeans by six times, while saving a year of research time.
The Scanalyzer got its start as part of a government-funded program called Transportation Energy Resources from Renewable Agriculture, which aims to help solve long-term energy challenges, researchers say.
The system's two massive legs straddle a 92-foot-wide, 1,200-foot-long strip of irrigated field, using wheels mounted on tracks to traverse the rows at a few centimeters per second. Suspended between the two legs is the box crammed with lenses, sensors and other scanning equipment that track each plant's growth rate, height, development and hardiness, capturing images at finer detail than humans can detect with the naked eye. The sensor array can count lesions on leaves caused by disease, and how a leaf's angle relative to the stalk may affect photosynthesis.
After constructing the robot in 2016, researchers spent the first few years testing varieties of sorghum, a grain that can thrive in hot and dry conditions, for Energy Department-funded research into new crops for alternative fuel sources. Corn, the primary crop used in the U.S. ethanol industry, typically requires more water and fertilizer.
In 2017, the Gates foundation pledged more than $1 million to train the Scanalyzer's eye on food crops, such as grains suited to developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Researchers have recently tested wheat and lettuce varieties.
Climate change is among the biggest challenges facing global agriculture, with shifts in temperature and rainfall pushing some crops into new regions, and reducing yields and quality elsewhere. "In Arizona, we have the climate of the future now," says Duke Pauli, assistant professor of plant sciences at the University of Arizona, who helps manage day-to-day Scanalyzer activities.
While Arizona's sometimes harsh environment is suited to testing plants' resilience, it can pose challenges for the robot itself. Dust has occasionally disrupted its electronics, and birds have built nests that obscured its sensors. One close call came in 2019, when a malfunction left the Scanalyzer immobilized as a thunderstorm rolled in. Workers used two pickup trucks to tow the robot between an array of poles that protect it from lightning strikes.
"You're asking for trouble when you have a massive hunk of steel out in the desert," says Todd Mockler, principal investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in suburban St. Louis, which is helping interpret the Scanalyzer's findings.
Some see bigger-picture challenges. Jeffrey White, a retired U.S. Department of Agriculture plant physiologist who worked on the project, says low-cost drones increasingly are able to do many of the same scans. For now, though, researchers say drones aren't able to match the clarity and detail of the images generated by the Scanalyzer system.
Biofuel research elsewhere has hit hurdles, particularly efforts that range beyond the most common corn-based ethanol approaches. DuPont Co. in 2018 pulled out of a long-running effort to produce ethanol from corn stalks and leaves, selling its Iowa production plant after profit proved elusive. Poet LLC, another major ethanol producer, in late 2019 paused a similar joint venture with Royal DSM, and laid off some workers.
Mr. Mockler says the long term research that can be done with the Scanalyzer will help overcome biofuel development challenges.
"Nobody's ever built one of these, and nobody knows how it's going to work," says Mr. Pauli. "Every day's a challenge."

Full text: Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, share goals such as raising corporate taxes and expanding health insurance to more Americans, but they disagreed during the Democratic primary campaign on how to approach policy areas including climate and trade.
Here is a guide to her positions and Mr. Biden's on a variety of issues.
Energy and climate
Ms. Harris has said she supports the Green New Deal, an overhaul of the economy to combat climate change. Mr. Biden has said he supports the goals behind the Green New Deal, but during the primaries, he backed a smaller investment than many progressives wanted.
Since becoming the party's presumptive nominee, he has called for a $2 trillion program to combat climate change over four years, more spending and a more ambitious timeline than he supported in the primaries.
Mr. Biden has proposed a fracking ban, but only for oil and gas production from federal lands. Ms. Harris, meanwhile, said during a CNN town hall last year: "There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking."
Health care
Ms. Harris signed onto Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All bill in the Senate. But during her presidential campaign, she tried to find a middle ground between backers of single-payer health care and those who prefer the current system, proposing a government-run health care system that would maintain a limited role for private health plans.
Mr. Biden's plan would expand on Obamacare by offering all Americans a public insurance option. He opposes a Medicare for All system, but he proposed lowering the Medicare age to 60 from 65.
Trade
Sen. Harris opposed two recent major trade deals that Mr. Biden supported, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Ms. Harris was one of just 10 senators who voted against the USMCA, President Trump's renegotiated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement. She said its environmental provisions were insufficient.
Mr. Biden cited labor union support in backing the USMCA. He had also voted for the original Nafta in 1993 when he was a senator.
Guaranteed Income
Ms. Harris has emerged as a leading voice pushing the Democratic Party toward some form of guaranteed income for all Americans -- and she has gone further in that direction than the head of the ticket.
One of the main planks in the economic platform of her presidential campaign was her plan to create a new program of government-funded checks for lower and middle-income families, modeled on the current earned-income tax credit.
Mr. Biden has issued a proposal more vague than Ms. Harris's, saying the government should "provide for additional checks to families should conditions require."
Taxes
Ms. Harris differed from her Democratic primary rivals by proposing full repeal of the 2017 tax cuts, which she had voted against.
Mr. Biden's plan would eliminate some of the cuts for companies and high-income households, leaving in place the tax cuts for people making under $400,000.
Immigration
Ms. Harris gained national attention in 2018 for her questioning of then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over the administration's separation of migrant families at the border. That same year, she was one of a handful of Democrats to oppose a plan to give the Trump administration billions of dollars for a border wall in exchange for creating a citizenship pathway for young immigrants living in the country without permission.
As a presidential candidate, Ms. Harris proposed using the executive branch's broad immigration powers to expand protections for unauthorized immigrants, including making it easier for those young people to apply for permanent resident status, a step on the way to becoming citizens. Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden both raised their hands when asked during a Democratic debate whether they would give health care to people who are in the U.S. illegally.
Ms. Harris endorsed the idea of decriminalizing border crossings at places other than official ports of entry, a proposal the party's left flank had embraced but that Mr. Biden never signed onto.
Ms. Harris later backtracked on her support, saying she didn't want to see migrants jailed but that she believed in border security.

Full text: The ice that hangs off the edge of Antarctica and floats on the ocean is melting faster than it is being replenished, even in pockets of East Antarctica typically thought to be less vulnerable to climate change, according to a study published Monday.
These structures, known as ice shelves, shed nearly 4,000 gigatons of their mass between 1994 and 2018, according to the new research, which leveraged nearly 25 years of satellite measurements of ice thickness. It echoes findings of numerous previous studies reporting the retreat and destabilization of Antarctic ice shelves but goes further, helping scientists understand the processes driving the melt around the entire continent over longer time periods and with high spatial resolution.
Antarctic ice loss can reverberate across the entire planet, changing global weather patterns, the researchers and other experts said.
The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, is part of a relatively new scientific discipline that aims to understand how the ocean interacts with ice sheets. Ice sheets are massive swaths of ice that cover Antarctica and Greenland. The edges of ice sheets can spill over onto the ocean, forming ice shelves.
Ice-shelf meltwater doesn't directly contribute to sea-level rise. Instead, the structures slow down the movement of ice flowing from the interior of the continent out to sea. The smaller they are, the less they hold back the flow and the faster ice on land can reach the ocean. That extra ice is what drives increases in sea levels.
"One of the biggest unknowns when we think about the future prognosis of ice-sheet response . . . is really what's happening at the ice-ocean interface. It's one of the parts of the polar ice-sheet system that we know the least about," said Michele Koppes, a glaciologist at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, who wasn't involved in the study.
She and others said the new work is a significant step toward mapping out where, when, how and how fast the melt of Antarctica's ice shelves is happening underwater. Unlike in Greenland, where most of the melt is happening on the surface, Antarctica's ice is largely melting from below.
The researchers showed that the mechanism and rate of ocean-driven melt differed by location. The melt rate also wasn't uniform across time: Most of the loss occurred in a period of less than a decade, in the mid-2000s, after which it continued but at a slower rate.
Ice shelves abutting the Weddell Sea to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, including the Ronne and Filchner ice shelves, melt at depths of thousands of meters, where the pressure is extremely high. That lowers the melting point of ice to less than minus 2 degrees Celsius. Much of the water around Antarctica is already above that temperature, naturally increasing the rate of melt, according to Susheel Adusumilli, a geophysicist at the University of California, San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the study's lead author.
"At great depths, it's easier to melt the ice. . . . That's been known for a long time, it just hasn't been mapped before" with this level of detail, he said.
The analysis showed Ronne and Filchner weren't losing as much mass as other ice shelves around the continent, including Getz in West Antarctica, considered the most vulnerable region to climate change.
Melting at Getz and in East Antarctica's Totten Ice Shelf is driven mostly by a different process. Their underbellies are enveloped by warmed ocean waters with temperatures of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius. With climate change, more warm water seeps to greater depths, increasing the proportion of the ice shelf that is vulnerable to melting.
Some areas seem to be more at-risk than others due to yet-unknown causes. The satellite data revealed melting is concentrated in narrow regions in some parts of the continent.

Full text: The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing new rules that would rescind regulations for methane-gas emissions, including ending requirements that oil-and-gas producers have systems and procedures to detect methane leaks in their systems, senior Trump administration officials said.
The rule changes will apply to wells drilled since 2016 and going forward, and remove the largest pipelines, storage sites and other parts of the transmission system from EPA oversight of smog and greenhouse-gas emissions. The changes also ease reporting requirements for the industry and, for some facilities, how often a plant must check for leaks of other pollutants, the officials said.
The new rules, expected to be signed and issued this week, adopt most of the core elements of two proposals from 2018 and 2019. Agency officials are fulfilling a directive by President Trump to ease regulations on U.S. energy producers and have said the rules being eliminated are duplicative of other federal and state rules.
They were adopted in 2016 under former President Obama amid concerns about methane-gas leaks contributing to climate change.
Methane accounts for about 10% of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, and it is about 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide in trapping the earth's heat, according to estimates used by the EPA. Agency figures show the oil-and-gas industry has long been the nation's largest emitter of methane, even before the shale boom.
As the drilling boom sent natural-gas production surging, the EPA responded in 2016 with requirements for companies to make plans for reducing emissions at new wells and the pipelines they feed. That included regular checks to close leaky valves, pipelines and tanks in the sprawling network covering millions of miles that supplies home furnaces, power plants, industrial sites and other consumers.
Rescinding these requirements was a priority for small-and midsize oil-and-gas producers, which say the requirements were so costly to meet that it would be unprofitable to drill in some places.
But larger producers, including international giants Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC, favored retaining the rules, saying a lack of climate regulation undermines their promise that the U.S. natural gas they sell is a cleaner source of energy.
Several states and environmental groups are likely to fight the decision. Basil Seggos, commissioner of New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, on Twitter said his agency would challenge the new rule. And the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit that has often collaborated with the major oil companies on methane, warned that the rule changes would create a risk for U.S. gas sales into Europe, which is moving to tighten emissions laws.
"The Trump EPA's methane rollbacks aren't just bad climate policy, they're a competitive disadvantage for American gas in a world demanding cleaner energy," said Ben Ratner, a senior director at the fund who works with companies on methane reduction.

Full text: The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted agricultural production and supply chains around the world. Farmers have often struggled to get their food to distant markets, and sharp shifts in demand have repeatedly forced them to dump crops.
Avoiding such logistical problems is one of the chief advantages of vertical farms, a new approach to agriculture that aims to grow food closer to population centers.
Over the past 10 years, hundreds of such indoor farms have sprouted up around the globe, mostly in the larger cities of industrialized countries. They occupy multistory buildings in which crops are grown in water or in misted air instead of soil, with LED lights in place of sunlight, in a controlled and largely automated environment.
Building more vertical farms in cities is especially timely because of the expected effects of the pandemic on urban office towers. Moody's Analytics REIS now projects office vacancies to rise to 19.3% in the 82 largest metropolitan areas by the end of the year, up from 16.8% last year, and then to continue rising. In June, 82% of employers surveyed by market-research firm Gartner, Inc. said that they would allow employees to work from home permanently. Indoor farms can occupy some of the abandoned or underused office space created by these trends.
So far, vertical farms have mostly grown and sold leafy greens and herbs -- the easiest food crops to grow indoors and to harvest year-round. They are competitive against conventional farms because their crops don't have to travel far and are free of pesticides and other soil contaminants.
As demand rises, however, vertical farms are poised to add a number of other crops that can be grown effectively indoors. These include root vegetables (potatoes, radishes, carrots, celery), vine vegetables (green beans, tomatoes, peppers), and bush fruits (blueberries, blackberries, raspberries). Such an expansion could eventually result in a significant shift of agriculture to cities, where 60% of the world's population now lives.
Vertical farms are no longer some futuristic fantasy. Well-established, efficient hydroponic and aeroponic methods have been paired with newer technology such as high-performance LED grow lights. Artificial intelligence now often controls the instruments that automatically deliver nutrients and provide optimal lighting for each crop.
The strictly controlled conditions inside vertical farms enable them to bypass the unpredictable variations of weather and soil and to exclude the heavy metals and other elements so common in traditional agriculture. Such control also allows endless experimentation to develop the best-tasting produce and most efficient ways of growing. And when pollination is required, bumblebees do the job quite nicely, just as they do outdoors.
Creating and maintaining that environment takes big startup costs for technology and ongoing costs for energy. But the efficiency of such farms allows nearly 95% of indoor seedlings to be grown to maturity and harvested, according to Gene Giacomelli, professor of biosystems engineering at the University of Arizona. By contrast, the survival rate for outdoor crops, from planting to harvest, vary from 90% in good years to 70% or less in drought or flood years. The latter have been increasing because of climate change, with record-high temperatures often accompanied by extreme weather patterns.
On multiple floors of a single building, layers of vertical fields can be harvested in phases to provide year-round crops. Since the farms are close to their target consumers, spoilage and damage from shipping are greatly reduced. Eventually, such farms could provide healthier produce options in under-served neighborhoods that have been described as "food deserts."
One of the largest and earliest commercial outfits, AeroFarms of Newark, N.J., was started by an agronomist in a defunct paintball arena in 2004. After several false starts, it flourished in 2014 with the help of $200 million in startup funding from the city and private firms. AeroFarms relocated to 70,000 square feet in Newark's Ironbound district and won contracts with local restaurants, supermarkets and school lunch programs. It has since added larger facilities of 150,000 square feet in Danville, Va., and 90,000 in Abu Dhabi. The company supplements its 72 staff with local personnel trained to work in various phases of crop production.
Infarm, founded in Israel in 2013 and now based in Berlin, operates differently, exporting its model directly to supermarkets. (I serve, without pay, on its science advisory board and as a paid advisory board member for another firm.) It provides in-store, automated hydroponic growing systems. Each store selects its own mix of greens and herbs, and consumers are encouraged to choose, taste and harvest from a menu growing right in front of them. The original startup employed a retrofitted 1955 Airstream trailer as its mobile crop production vehicle. Now it employs more than 400 people in 40 countries, mostly in Europe. It sells through, among others, Kroger grocery stores on the West Coast and Marks and Spencer in London.
There are many other vertical-farm startups backed by venture capital and expanding in Europe and the U.S., as well as on the Arabian peninsula, where they can provide an alternative to hot, arid conditions. But other firms have failed, or have canceled expansion plans, as they struggle to manage their costs and compete in local markets. And vertical farms aren't likely to gain a competitive advantage over conventional farming when it comes to important commodities such as fruits grown in orchards or grains grown in vast fields. Both are possible to raise in vertical indoor settings, but so far, their yields are too low and seasonal to be economical.
The pandemic has sparked new demand for the industry. San Francisco-based vertical farm Plenty says that a significant increase in shipments has sped up its effort to diversify crops. The company has already experimented with strategies to add items such as tomatoes and strawberries.
Covid-19 has been a harbinger of longer-term problems in food security for our cities. One answer may come from growing more of our food just down the street.

Full text: The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing the U.S.'s first climate standards for commercial airliners and large business jets, aligning U.S. rules with global standards approved by a branch of the United Nations and giving jet makers eight years to comply.
The proposal would use efficiency standards to limit carbon-dioxide and nitrous-oxide emissions from commercial airliners and large business jets in the U.S. rolled out by 2028, according to Wednesday's EPA announcement. Aircraft companies would have to apply the limits to any new designs starting this year.
The most important part of the move is ensuring U.S. jets can still sell abroad, agency leaders said. U.S. manufacturers export three of every four aircraft they make, the EPA said, and U.S. companies face the potential of losing those sales if their planes don't meet international standards.
Members of the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N.'s commercial-aviation regulator, committed in 2016 to capping carbon-dioxide emissions from international flights at 2020 levels. The organization intended the agreement to complement the Paris climate accord, which excluded airplane emissions because of their cross-border nature.
Aircraft account for about 2% of the global carbon emissions that help cause climate change, according to U.S. data and environmental groups.
Flights from U.S. destinations accounted for about a quarter of those emissions, and aircraft emissions were rising faster than expected, according to an analysis last year from the International Council on Clean Transportation, the U.S.-based group that helped expose the Volkswagen diesel scandal.
Shippers and companies that buy aircraft have been concerned such rules could raise costs. But manufacturers, including Boeing Co., have been supportive to avoid any potential fight over their ability to sell their products abroad.
"The loud-and-clear message I heard was to implement the ICAO standard, which is what we're proposing to do today," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said.
The Federal Aviation Administration will eventually do its own rule making to outline how it enforces those standards and certifies U.S.-made aircraft, the EPA said.
Airlines for America, a trade group for U.S. air carriers and shippers, said the decision is crucial to ensure they can keep flying U.S.-made aircraft abroad.
The rule would help the aviation industry on a self-imposed effort to cut its global emissions by half between 2005 and 2050, said the group and Boeing in separate statements.

Full text: Cities are trying to reduce carbon emissions at office buildings. That goal is now colliding with efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Landlords and property managers are pumping more outside air into their buildings, a procedure thought to reduce the likelihood of workers catching an airborne virus. But the practice leads to higher energy bills and an uptick in emissions that can contribute to climate change.
Making real estate more energy-efficient is considered crucial to slowing down global warming. Buildings and construction account for 39% of all energy-related carbon emissions, according to a 2019 report by the United Nations Environment Program. Some states and cities adopted aggressive targets to reduce building emissions, along with fines for landlords who overshoot the cap.
But amid fears of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, some building owners find they face a choice between lowering their energy use and keeping tenants safer from infection.
Studies show the new coronavirus is airborne and can linger in indoor spaces, putting office workers at risk. The trade group ASHRAE, formally known as the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, urged property managers in April to consider keeping HVAC systems running for 24 hours a day and bringing in more outside air. Because outside air typically has to be heated in the winter or cooled in the summer, it uses up more energy than recirculating indoor air.
In a recent study, real-estate technology company Enertiv found HVAC costs in office buildings increased 36% during the pandemic. But it found landlords used the time during which many buildings were unoccupied to upgrade building systems and reduce waste, which could partially offset the increase in costs.
Landlords in some cities face not just higher energy bills, but also steep fines. In New York, the country's largest office market, the city council last year passed a bill that set emission caps for buildings with a goal of reducing carbon emissions 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.
Starting in 2024, some building owners that fail to reduce emissions face fines of as much as millions of dollars a year. "It's probably the most aggressive greenhouse-gas bill in the country," said Robert LoForte, president of infrastructure-services firm Veritas Solutions Group.
For years, property owners and managers saw reducing the flow of outside air into a building as an important tool to lower costs and emissions, Mr. LoForte said. Meanwhile, unlike hospitals and laboratories, office buildings never had any air-filtration requirements, he said.
But now, landlords face potential lawsuits if tenants in their buildings become infected and a court determines that negligence occurred, said Brenden Millstein, chief executive of Carbon Lighthouse, a company that helps building owners cut emissions. This doesn't mean landlords have to use as much energy as possible, he said. Following the most extreme air-safety measures would increase the carbon emissions for a typical office building by about 50%, he said.
The key is finding a balance. For example, property owners can make air in buildings cleaner without a surge in energy costs by installing more advanced filters. They can also adjust the settings on HVAC systems at times when no one is in the building.
"Somewhere between nothing and 100% outside air 100% of the time is a line at which what the landlord is doing is very, very reasonable," Mr. Millstein said.

Full text: Apple Inc. is pledging to become carbon neutral across its business, including its mostly overseas supply chain, within the next 10 years, the latest corporate giant planning to shift its operations to battle climate change.
The iPhone maker said Tuesday that the new commitment means that by 2030, every Apple device sold will have been produced with no net release of carbon into the atmosphere. The company plans to reduce its emissions by 75% and develop carbon-removal solutions for the remaining 25% of its footprint.
Apple said its global corporate operations are already carbon neutral and that all of its iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch devices released in the past year are made with some recycled content.
"The innovations powering our environmental journey are not only good for the planet -- they've helped us make our products more energy efficient and bring new sources of clean energy online around the world," Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a written statement. "Climate action can be the foundation for a new era of innovative potential, job creation, and durable economic growth."
Apple's new environmental goals follow the company's announcement last month that it plans to ship its Mac computers later this year with custom chips, marking the end of a 15-year technology partnership with Intel Corp. Apple has also been working in recent years to replace many other third-party parts with components designed in-house, and last year the company asked suppliers to study shifting final assembly of some products out of China.
Almost all of the products that Apple sells world-wide are made in China. The company's initiative means that it will work to transition its manufacturing suppliers to renewable sources of electricity to power their operations.
Chinese manufacturers that hope to continue working with Apple will now need to consider making changes to how they operate to satisfy the company's environmental-related ambitions, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. "Many of those partners are going to have to shift their strategy if they want to stay on Apple's good side," he said.
Apple said that so far, 71 of its manufacturing partners in 17 countries have committed to making its products using 100% renewable energy. The company estimates those renewable-energy projects, once completed, will help avoid more than 14.3 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide emissions into the atmosphere annually.
Apple joins large companies in a range of industries that have pledged emission cuts in recent years, including cosmetics maker L'Oreal SA, pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk A/S and candy maker Mars Inc.
Other technology giants have also become involved. In January, software company Microsoft Corp. said it would become "carbon negative" by 2030 and that by 2050 it plans to offset all emissions it has produced since its founding in 1975. And Amazon.com Inc. said last year that it would add a fleet of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles in a drive to be carbon neutral by 2040. Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos also committed $10 billion to start a new fund to fight climate change.
The commitments come as companies face pressure from investors, employees and consumers to take action on emissions, according to nonprofits and experts focused on sustainability.

Full text: President Trump said his administration has completed its update to the National Environmental Policy Act, including changes that will mandate deadlines for completing environmental reviews.
The new rules would require full environmental impact statements to be completed within two years. Less comprehensive environmental assessments would have to be concluded within one year. It hews to a proposal the administration made in January.
The measures, which are expected to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday and go into effect in 60 days, are supported by business groups and trade unions who say the environmental review process has been distorted to become a tool to endlessly delay needed infrastructure.
The changes are opposed by environmentalists who say the reviews serve as a bulwark against climate change and help protect poor and minority communities that typically lack the resources to defend their interests from development.
Mr. Trump made his announcement at a late-afternoon visit to United Parcel Service Inc.'s Hapeville Airport Hub in Atlanta. He said the overhaul will lead to better roads, bridges and tunnels for shippers and commuters. "For decades the single biggest obstacle to building a modern transportation system has been the mountains and mountains of bureaucratic red tape in Washington, D.C.," he said.
Environmental reviews now take longer than four years on average -- seven for highways, according to the administration. It has previously estimated a national backlog of infrastructure projects at nearly $1 trillion.
Democrats and environmental groups say the changes could limit legal rights for people who file comments late in the environmental review process. They are also concerned climate change may get less scrutiny. "This is the height of stupidity, the equivalent of sticking your head in the sand like an ostrich -- and then hoping the water doesn't rise," said Samantha Gross, a fellow specializing in climate and energy at the Brookings Institution.
Business lobbyists who support the changes say a much larger overhaul is still necessary to break the gridlock. "NEPA is just a small component of that," said Ben Norris, senior counsel at the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's largest trade group. "The foot shouldn't come off the gas. There's a lot more to do here."
Pipelines are likely to benefit, experts said, from one of the new policy's biggest changes, excluding more projects from the most stringent reviews.

Full text: Former Vice President Joe Biden unveiled a $2 trillion proposal to combat climate change, calling for a bigger investment and faster action than he backed during the Democratic primaries.
"If I have the honor of being elected president, we're not just going to tinker around the edges. We're going to make historic investments that will seize the opportunity and meet this moment in history," Mr. Biden said during a speech in Wilmington, Del.
Mr. Biden's program would use climate policy as an economic-development tool over a framework of four years. Last summer, he proposed spending $1.7 trillion during a decade. The souped-up investment Mr. Biden unveiled Tuesday is part of an economic plan the presumptive Democratic nominee began releasing last week, when he announced a $700 billion economic-revival program.
The climate plan would attempt to eliminate carbon emissions from the power grid by 2035, put Americans into electric vehicles and zero-emissions mass transit, and rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The proposal would devote spending to minority communities and bolster rules to support unions, which the Biden campaign frames as a way to ensure benefits go first to poor and working-class people and to communities hurt the most by pollution.
"Here we are with an economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity, not to go back to where we were before, but better, stronger, more resilient and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead," Mr. Biden said.
The former vice president is seeking to draw parallels between climate change and the pandemic as he makes the case for his sweeping initiative. He blames President Trump for a slow response to the coronavirus and for fueling an economic decline by not heeding scientific advisers.
Climate change is another impending crisis, the Biden campaign says in its proposal, promising to take guidance from scientists. The plan's emphasis on urgent progress mirrors recommendations from the United Nations-led scientific panel that says the world must drastically reduce and even reverse greenhouse-gas emissions in the coming decades to avoid climate change's most catastrophic outcomes.
The Trump administration has ignored that report, and the president has said he doesn't believe the government's own dire scientific assessments of climate change. His administration has been undoing much of the country's climate policy as part of a deregulatory agenda, calling Obama administration initiatives legal overreach that hamper U.S. manufacturing and energy businesses.
"When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is hoax," Mr. Biden said. "When I think about climate change, the word I think of is jobs, good-paying union jobs that put Americans to work."
Mr. Biden's climate plan adds to the more than $7 trillion in new federal spending the former vice president has proposed over the next 10 years, according to campaign and think-tank estimates.
Biden officials said the program would be paid for with a mix of tax increases on corporations and the wealthy, as well as stimulus spending, likely related to the pandemic. A campaign aide said if Mr. Biden is elected, he would work with Congress to expand stimulus spending that wouldn't need to be offset by spending cuts.
Mr. Biden previously released a tax plan that would return the top individual income-tax rate for individuals with incomes above $400,000 to 39.6% from 37% under current law. He also would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.
A Biden campaign official said the plan involves a mix of executive action and congressional legislation. The House is currently led by Democrats, but Republicans hold the Senate, posing a likely obstacle to some of Mr. Biden's biggest promises if the GOP remains in control. There are longstanding fights about the effectiveness of federal subsidies in steering environmental policy, some of which are likely to re-emerge in any effort to implement Mr. Biden's initiatives.

Full text: For climate scientists, the pandemic has made one thing clearer: the difficulty of reducing carbon emissions.
Emissions sank when factories were shut down, planes grounded and cars parked, as people stayed home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but they are rebounding fast as economies reopen.
When two-thirds of the world's population was under lockdown in early April, carbon emissions were down 17%, compared with average daily emissions last year, according to a study by a group of climate scientists published in the journal Nature Climate Change. By June 11, the drop was 5%.
"We're getting to this by stopping all activities, not structural changes, so when people go back to work there's no reason these emissions wouldn't go shooting back up," said Corinne Le Quere, a professor of climate change science and policy at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia, who led the study. For a lasting impact, governments need to encourage low-emissions technologies such as electric vehicles, she added.
Governments have put more effort into reducing emissions since the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees. Since then, emissions have continued to rise, and the U.S. has said it is withdrawing from the deal.
Emissions are typically monitored monthly and annually, but scientists say the pandemic has accelerated efforts to move toward a system of daily reporting. To do that, they are tapping proxy data, such as measuring road traffic via daily requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.'s maps app and TomTom NV statistics, and using data transmitted by smart meters to gauge residential electricity demand.
Scientists wanted to measure the impact lockdowns were having on global emissions and how long it would take to return to prelockdown levels.
"The virus will fundamentally change carbon cycle science, it already has in that we're focusing on real-time carbon emissions," said Rob Jackson, chairman of the Global Carbon Project, which produces annual data focused on emissions from fossil fuels and land use.
"We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates," Mr. Jackson said. "What we weren't as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data."
Scientists say that greater use of that data -- while not as accurate as more direct sources -- has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound.
"I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge," said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL.
The United Nations Environment Program says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.
The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons -- the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities.
For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth.
This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for climate-friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June.
Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy.
Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22% and road and rail transport at 21%.
"It's shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport," said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading in England.
Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions.
However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic -- and the impact of those actions on emissions -- isn't yet clear.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A House panel studying climate change called on Congress to adopt policies that would make the U.S. economy carbon-neutral by 2050, recommending steps Democrats say would head off the worst consequences of a warming planet.
The plan proposes Congress mandate that every car sold by 2035 doesn't emit carbon, overhaul the electricity grid by 2040 and limit fossil-fuel production on public lands. The 547-page report is a product of the Democratic members of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
The recommendations, which also include strengthening labor protections and updating building codes, put the House Democratic plan roughly in line with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's vision to make the country carbon-neutral by 2050. But they stop short of the timeline of the Green New Deal, a wide-ranging resolution favored by many progressive Democrats and climate activists that seeks to wean the economy off fossil fuels by 2030.
"The pollution and the costly impacts will get worse unless we act now," said Rep. Kathy Castor (D., Fla.), chairwoman of the climate panel.
The plan endorses putting a price on carbon emissions, an idea at the center of a previous Democratic climate plan that failed to receive a Senate vote after it passed the House in 2009. It also pushes for creating incentives for green-energy production, investing in technology for capturing carbon from the atmosphere and expanding the amount of U.S. land subject to federal protections.
Some Republicans, including President Trump, have questioned the scientific consensus that human activity drives climate change, dismissing the costs of proposals like the Green New Deal as prohibitive. But a growing number of GOP lawmakers are offering alternatives: A group of House Republicans outlined a series of policy proposals earlier this year that emphasize technological innovation and removing carbon emissions from the atmosphere.
In a joint statement, Republicans on the climate committee said they were still reviewing the Democratic report, while touting the value of U.S. energy production and casting skepticism on provisions to limit domestic carbon emissions.
"If the United States aims to reduce global emissions and lead the global energy future, then poorly designed domestic climate policies that increase costs or add burdensome regulations must be avoided," they said.
The release of the plan comes as Democrats have sought to unify behind policy proposals on the issue. Last year, Democrats in the House reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, voting to try to block Mr. Trump from leaving the international accord. They will also vote this week on an infrastructure bill that includes several measures aimed at fighting climate change.
Last year was the second-warmest since systematic record-keeping began in 1880, federal agencies reported in February.Much scientific work attributes rising temperatures to greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide from fossil-fuel emissions, agriculture and cement production, and land-use changes.
