Full text: Nearly six million properties across the U.S. have a substantial risk of flooding that isn't disclosed by federal flood maps, according to a nonprofit research firm that released its own U.S. flood maps Monday.
The maps from nonprofit First Street Foundation highlight the widespread nature of flood risk. Flooding caused about $17 billion in property damage a year from 2010 to 2018, according to the Association of State Floodplain Managers.
First Street, which is made up of researchers, modelers and scientists, advocates for providing homeowners with more information about flooding and climate change. It relies on grant money, much of which has come from organizations focused on mitigating the effects of climate change.
Homeowners, developers and city planners have long used the Federal Emergency Management Agency's flood maps, which outline flood zones. FEMA's maps label which properties have at least a 1% annual risk of flooding, also called a 100-year flood zone.
The First Street analysis suggests millions of American homeowners could be more vulnerable to flooding than they realize, and many may lack the resources to rebuild their homes in the event of severe flood damage. Mortgage lenders typically require buyers of homes in a 100-year flood zone to purchase flood insurance.
FEMA classifies 8.7 million properties as having a 1% annual flood risk, according to First Street, while First Street's maps put 14.6 million properties into that category, or about 10.3% of all properties in the contiguous U.S.
The organization said its maps show more properties with 1% flood risk than the FEMA maps because it includes parts of the country that FEMA hasn't mapped, uses current climate data and incorporates rainfall-related flooding.
FEMA said its maps are intended for floodplain-management and emergency-response decisions. "The FEMA Flood Insurance Risk Maps and First Street Foundation maps do not conflict with each other, rather they complement one another by depicting different types of risk," FEMA said. "Users should explore the differences between the maps to build a more comprehensive understanding of flood risk."
First Street is making its flood-risk data, including a 1-to-10 score for each property in the contiguous U.S., available free to consumers. Its data also include projections for how each property's flood risk might change in the next 30 years, based on climate models.
Some of the biggest gaps between the First Street and FEMA maps are in inland states.
First Street also projected that by 2050, the total number of contiguous U.S. properties with a 1% annual flooding risk will increase to 16.2 million, or 11.4% of total properties.
Many counties in the U.S. aren't mapped by FEMA, and in about 3,300 communities the maps are more than 15 years old, said Michael Grimm, FEMA's assistant administrator for risk management for the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration, in testimony at a February congressional hearing. FEMA's maps also don't reflect projected future sea-level rise or expectations for increased rainfall in some areas due to climate change.
"FEMA's maps are a snapshot in time, and some of those snapshots fade in time," said Roy Wright, chief executive of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety and the former chief executive of the National Flood Insurance Program.
In the past three years, more than 40% of flood claims have been for properties that are unmapped by FEMA or outside FEMA's 1% annual risk zones, according to Mr. Grimm's testimony.
"We have a lot more flood risk in the country than we currently understand," said Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers.
Still, Mr. Berginnis cautioned that the thousands of local floodplain managers around the country hadn't seen First Street's maps and might disagree with the methodology.
Scott Kozicki's house in the Bellevue neighborhood of Nashville, Tenn., didn't have flood insurance when it was destroyed by the city's catastrophic flooding in May 2010. It took him years to rebuild. He now has flood insurance on the property, even though it isn't required. "The flood was the most devastating thing I've ever seen," he said.
In Davidson County, where Nashville is located, First Street said 10% of the properties have at least a 1% annual flood risk, compared with about 3% on the FEMA maps.

Full text: The Minnesota attorney general sued Exxon Mobil Corp., Koch Industries and a top oil-and-gas trade group Wednesday, alleging they have for years deceived consumers about the effects of climate change.
Attorney General Keith Ellison said Exxon, three Koch companies and the American Petroleum Institute deceived the public about climate-change science to protect their business interests and, in doing so, violated Minnesota laws that prohibit consumer fraud, deceptive trade practices and false advertising.
The lawsuit seeks an injunction barring further violations, financial restitution for alleged damages to Minnesotans and an order requiring the entities to fund a public-education campaign on climate change. Mr. Ellison said the penalties could amount to billions of dollars.
"This lawsuit is part of a coordinated, politically motivated campaign against energy companies," Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said. "The claims are baseless and without merit. We look forward to defending the company in court."
A spokeswoman for API, one of the industry's largest trade groups, also denied the allegations. A spokeswoman for Flint Hills Resources, a Koch Subsidiary, said it is reviewing the lawsuit.
The suit is latest targeting the oil industry over its contribution to global warming and alleged deception about the accuracy of climate-change science. Minnesota joins more than a dozen states and municipalities that have sued energy companies on similar grounds.
The industry has fiercely contested the lawsuits, which have so far not resulted in any verdicts against oil and gas companies.
In December, a New York state judge cleared Exxon of fraud claims, saying New York's attorney general had failed to establish that the oil giant had deceived investors about how it accounted for the cost of future climate-change regulation.
A pair of climate-related lawsuits in California may be headed for trial after the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected arguments by energy companies in May, ruling that state courts are the proper forum for the suits. In those cases, brought by the cities of Oakland and San Francisco, the defendants -- Exxon, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, BP PLC, and Royal Dutch ShellPLC -- are expected to appeal.
In the Minnesota suit, the attorney general alleged internal climate experts at the companies issued warnings to executives about global warming for years as the companies simultaneously financed public relations campaigns that misled the public.
"The fraud, deceptive advertising and other violations of Minnesota state law and common law that the lawsuit shows they perpetrated have harmed Minnesotans' health and our state's environment, infrastructure, and economy," Mr. Ellison said.

Full text: Amazon.com Inc. is launching a $2 billion internal venture-capital fund focused on technology investments to reduce the impact of climate change, the latest sustainability initiative from the technology giant after criticism of its environmental record.
The new fund, which will be called the Climate Pledge Fund, will invest in companies across a number of industries, including transportation, energy generation, battery storage, manufacturing and food and agriculture, according to the company. The aim is to help Amazon and other companies reach a goal of "net zero" carbon emissions by 2040. Amazon and a number of other companies are seeking to reduce the climate impact of their operations, both through reduced use of fossil fuels and investments in projects such as reforestation.
"Companies from around the world of all sizes and stages will be considered, from pre-product startups to well-established enterprises," Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said. "Each prospective investment will be judged on its potential to accelerate the path to zero carbon and help protect the planet for future generations."
Amazon didn't provide a time horizon for the $2 billion, which it described as "initial funding" that could grow over time. With the fund, Amazon would become a significant corporate player in new energy investing, which has risen significantly in the last decade. Global venture capital and private-equity investments in clean energy reached $10.5 billion in 2019, up 6% from the previous year and the highest since 2010, according to BloombergNEF. Investments in new energy ventures and climate-change mitigation strategies come from a variety of sources, including traditional venture capitalists, billionaires, governments and companies in energy, automobile and technology industries.
The trillion-dollar Seattle-based company has come under pressure in recent years for its toll on the environment from delivering millions of packages to its customers each year. Last year, a group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice wrote an open letter, signed by thousands of employees, urging the company to commit to a deadline to secure 100% of its electricity from renewable sources.
Amazon said its emissions rose 15% in 2019 compared with the previous year, reaching the equivalent of 51.17 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.
Amazon last year co-founded an initiative called "The Climate Pledge," which is a commitment to reach carbon-reduction goals set in the Paris Climate Agreement and be carbon-neutral by 2040, or a decade early. Verizon Communications Inc., Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC and Infosys Ltd. also recently signed the pledge.

Full text: A young challenger calling for generational change versus an older incumbent is hardly a unique dynamic in modern Democratic politics. But in Massachusetts, the former is the scion of the state's most powerful political dynasty, and the veteran has the backing of liberals known for taking on the establishment, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
The U.S. Senate campaigns of incumbent Ed Markey and Rep. Joe Kennedy III have emerged after weeks of coronavirus lockdown, meeting last week for a debate in Springfield, Mass., and for another Monday, as the race between the two Democrats shapes up to be one of the fiercest primary contests of 2020.
With few policy differences between them -- both candidates support Medicare for All, for example -- the two men are entering the summer stretch before their Sept. 1 primary battling over who is better positioned to deliver for Massachusetts voters.
Mr. Kennedy, 39, has made a line of attack out of Mr. Markey's long career in Washington. He has criticized the 73-year-old for supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 and voting for the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq. At the debate last week, Mr. Markey -- a Boston-area resident first elected to the House in 1976 before winning a special Senate election in 2013 -- faced questions from Mr. Kennedy and moderators about how often he had traveled to western Massachusetts.
"This moment calls for us to do something different, to build something better and bigger, and we will not do that with the same folks and the same mind-set that brought us the last 50 years," Mr. Kennedy said.
Mr. Markey has responded by pointing to endorsements from local officials across the state, and in one digital advertisement, his campaign said Mr. Kennedy was "out of line" for playing politics during the pandemic. He has highlighted his record on climate change -- he co-wrote the Green New Deal, a wide-ranging proposal to wean the U.S. economy off fossil fuels by 2030, along with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, of New York -- as he argues that he can better deliver on liberal policy goals than Mr. Kennedy, who has served in the House since 2013.
"I have led and delivered for the state of Massachusetts since I've been given the honor of serving," he said at the debate.
When Mr. Kennedy said he would challenge Mr. Markey last September, a head-to-head poll showed the younger man leading by 14 percentage points, and Mr. Kennedy outraised Mr. Markey in the past two quarters. Polls this year have generally found Mr. Kennedy ahead as well, with some showing the race narrowing.
Liberal groups that have gained national attention for backing challengers to incumbents have come to Mr. Markey's defense. The Massachusetts chapter of Our Revolution, a political organization associated with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, recently endorsed him, as has Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.).
Environment America Action Fund, a super PAC affiliated with the advocacy group Environment America, will spend $200,000 on digital and print advertisements supporting Mr. Markey through June, said Ben Hellerstein, the state director for the group's Massachusetts chapter. The organization is reaching out to other progressive organizations as it considers additional support for Mr. Markey before the election.
Mr. Kennedy said in a Facebook video that some of his supporters were considering starting their own independent spending effort to counter the support for Mr. Markey.
"I know nothing about this, I didn't ask for it, and we don't want it, we don't need it. We need to, as Democrats, reject dark money; we need to reject super PACs," Mr. Kennedy said.
Republicans are also holding a primary in September for the safe Democratic seat.

Full text: Joe Biden says he will add details to his climate plan and is likely to propose new investments, an olive branch to Bernie Sanders and his liberal allies. But in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Republicans are already portraying the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee as a threat to the oil-and-gas industry.
Mr. Biden has indicated he is willing to do more to address climate change, saying last month that possible areas to build on include investing in clean-energy technologies and policies that prevent minority communities from being disproportionately hurt by things including pollution and waste storage. A climate task force he put together with the help of Mr. Sanders, his former rival for the Democratic nomination, began meeting last week.
To give himself the best chance of beating President Trump in November, Mr. Biden must motivate young, liberal voters and keep the support of older, centrist voters. Mr. Biden named establishment Democrat John Kerry, who helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement, and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has proposed weaning the U.S. off fossil fuels with a plan known as the Green New Deal, to lead his climate task force. He says he will add new climate proposals but wouldn't ban fracking, a top target of environmental activists.
"He looks forward to reviewing recommendations from the task force to build upon his ambitious ideas, but it is not about shifting left or right," said Biden policy director Stef Feldman. "It is about following the science, investing in our economy, and pioneering a clean energy revolution."
Ms. Feldman said the jobs created would be union jobs. Matt Hill, another Biden aide, said the jobs would be in industries related to green infrastructure, manufacturing and renewable energy.
Republicans are trying to disrupt his balancing act by using the former vice president's openness to new climate policies against him in states including Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump narrowly won four years ago and where natural-gas extraction is a significant industry. Mr. Biden spent his early years in Scranton and has maintained ties to the state, including placing his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia.
Nearly 30,000 people worked in extraction, drilling and other jobs in Pennsylvania tied to the Marcellus Shale, according to the state's Department of Labor & Industry. Even before the coronavirus pandemic caused oil prices to plummet, shale drilling companies were already pulling back.
Mr. Trump and his allies are working to tie Mr. Biden to Mr. Sanders on energy, portraying the presumptive nominee as too liberal for states such as Pennsylvania.
"Energy jobs will be dead," and hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvania voters will lose work in a Biden administration, said one Facebook digital ad targeted at the state.
Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey said he is confident Mr. Biden can win his state. But he said when Mr. Biden was thinking about running for president, he warned him that Mr. Trump had the strongest grip on working-class voters he had seen from a Republican nominee. "I said we have to work very hard to get some of those voters back," Mr. Casey said.

Full text: TORONTO -- Norway's sovereign-wealth fund said that it is blacklisting four of Canada's largest oil producers from its trillion-dollar portfolio, citing high carbon emissions from their operations.
The decision delivered another blow to Canada's reeling oil industry, which is struggling with low oil prices and limited access to global markets.
The Norwegian fund, which had more than $1.1 trillion in assets at the end of 2019, making it one of the world's largest investors, excluded Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc., Suncor Energy Inc., and Exxon Mobil Corp.-owned Imperial Oil Ltd. from its fund.
"The Council of Ethics recommended to exclude the companies because of carbon emissions from production of oil," the fund said. It was the first time the fund has used "unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions" as a reason for blacklisting companies.
The fund also said Wednesday it is excluding coal companies Sasol Ltd., RWE AG, Glencore PLC, AGL Energy Ltd. and Anglo American PLC.
Alex Pourbaix, the chief executive of Cenovus, defended his company's record, in an emailed statement. "Cenovus has reduced the [green-house gas] emissions intensity at our oil sands operations by approximately 30% over the past 15 years. And we've set ambitious targets to reduce our emissions intensity by another 30% across our operations by 2030 and hold absolute emissions flat during that time," he said.
Representatives for Canadian Natural, Suncor and Imperial didn't respond to requests for comment.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the Norwegian fund's decision reflects changing attitudes among investors toward climate change.
"That is why it is so important for Canada to continue to move forward on fighting climate change and reducing our emissions," he said, adding that "many companies in the energy sector understood that the investment climate is shifting and there is a need for clear leadership and clear targets to draw on global capital."
Norway telegraphed its move away from oil and gas last year, partly as a way to shield the oil-rich nation from falling crude prices. The Scandinavian country built its wealth on crude through its massive North Sea oil fields, and the profits from those fields are managed by the sovereign-wealth fund.
Norway's pullout isn't the first time Canada's oil industry has been shunned by investors trying to curb their exposure to carbon-intensive businesses.
In recent months, insurance company the Hartford has said it would no longer insure or invest in companies that get more than a quarter of their revenue from oil-sands extraction; Sweden's central bank said it had sold bonds issued by Alberta, the Canadian province where the oil sands are located, as part of a larger effort to focus investing on climate-friendly assets. They join others, including investor BlackRock Inc., and European bank HSBC, which said they would limit business with the industry.
Though the energy sector remains one of the largest drivers of Canada's economy -- it contributes almost 10% of the country's GDP -- the industry continues to face domestic pressure to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Interior Department has given final approval for what it says will be the largest solar-power project in the U.S., a $1 billion installation in Nevada that could power about 260,000 households -- enough to cover the residential population of Las Vegas.
The project has financial backing from NV Energy Inc., a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, a private-equity firm.
The two companies signed a 25-year deal last year to take the solar farm's output of 690 megawatts.
Major business consumers have been clamoring for more wind and solar power to help slow climate change and lower bills.
Nevada last year joined several states that have passed laws committing to emissions-free power, mandating that half of its electricity must come from renewables by 2030.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt signed approval Monday for what is called the Gemini Solar Project to go forward on 7,000 acres of federal land in the desert 33 miles northeast of Las Vegas, the Interior Department said.
The Interior Department touts the project as a boon to the economy and the environment, with the potential to employ up to 900 construction workers and produce emissions-free power to offset the greenhouse-gas output of 83,000 cars.
"That project would be a major producer of energy," Mr. Bernhardt said. "I'm glad that we're getting this out, and it's really part of our effort to foster jobs."
Construction was originally set begin one month after final approval, with the first phase expected to be completed within a year, and full operation by 2023.
Mr. Bernhardt warned, however, that the coronavirus pandemic might delay that timeline.
While President Trump has shrugged off dire scientific warnings about global warming, the administration has also proposed cutting red tape on environmental reviews and says Gemini fits with its priority of facilitating investment in important infrastructure projects.
"This project will create jobs that our community needs as it deals with the current pandemic," NV Energy said.
Gemini is unique among the country's largest solar projects in that it includes major battery capacity to keep feeding the grid overnight, an emerging trend among new solar projects, according to an arm of energy-consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. "It's just a monstrous project," said Colin Smith, an analyst atWood Mackenzie. "I see it as the next step. We're going to keep seeing bigger and bigger solar."
Berkshire is also invested in the biggest operating U.S. solar farm, Solar Star, a 586-megawatt project outside Los Angeles. Quinbrook focuses on lower carbon and renewable-energy infrastructure, with offices in Houston, the U.K. and Australia.

Full text: When he managed billions of dollars for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Robert Litterman used sophisticated mathematical models to control risk. Now he is advising the government, and he believes it isn't doing enough to avoid serious losses, including taking drastic steps to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
The coronavirus crisis shows the cost of failing to properly assess risks. "It's a perfect example of when you have a risk-management problem -- it's urgent, you don't know how much time you have," Mr. Litterman said. "With coronavirus, we wasted so many weeks."
Mr. Litterman, 68 years old, left Goldman a decade ago and now chairs a group working on the risks of climate change for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While he doesn't invest for Goldman anymore, he is betting his personal cash that the world will more rapidly address the risks. "We've got to slam on the brakes" on carbon emissions, he said. "It's way past time."
In March, he testified before a congressional committee looking into the economic impact of global warming. Mr. Litterman told Congress that his analysis of the issue, partly based on models he used to manage risk in financial markets, shows failure to act quickly could result in a "tragic and potentially catastrophic mistake." The way to offset that risk, he says, is to rapidly decrease emissions of carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas.
Rostin Behnam, the CFTC commissioner who launched the climate-change group, said he chose Mr. Litterman to lead the effort because of his "gravitas on financial markets" and experience in the economics of global warming.
One way to curb fossil-fuel emissions, Mr. Litterman says, is through a carbon-tax proposal named after two former Republican secretaries of state, James Baker and George Shultz. The Baker-Shultz plan envisions a $40 per ton tax that would increase every year by roughly 5%. Money collected would be returned to U.S. citizens at a rate of $500 per person a year. A goal of the tax -- which Mr. Litterman thinks might be too low -- is to affect incentives for consumers, business owners and investors, possibly changing their behavior. A higher price for gasoline could prompt people to drive less, and they might purchase an electric car instead of an SUV. Businesses might switch to solar- or wind-generated electricity.
Incentives granted the fossil-fuel industry today, such as state-sponsored subsidies, are wrongheaded, Mr. Litterman said. He concedes that the current economic downturn likely makes a tax on fossil fuels politically unpalatable. President Trump has long played down the risk of global warming. His administration has rolled back rules to curb carbon emissions, such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants.
Mr. Litterman is putting his money where his mouth is. After leaving Goldman, he helped found a New York trading firm, Kepos Capital, that is planning a fund that will invest in assets related to a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy.
In his personal account, Mr. Litterman says he owns a derivative constituting a bet that one basket of stocks -- coal, tar sands and oil companies -- will underperform the broader market. He says the stranded-asset total return swap has gained about 13% this year as oil prices slumped world-wide. So-called stranded assets are fossil fuels some expect will be left in the ground as the world shifts toward renewable-energy sources, such as solar and wind.
Mr. Litterman enjoyed a storied career at Goldman. As head of a giant quantitative investment team that used mathematical models to buy and sell assets, he helped manage billions of dollars' worth of investments for Goldman.
After leaving Goldman, Mr. Litterman began meeting with people in the environmental community, and joined the board of the World Wildlife Fund. He agreed about the risk of climate change but thought the potential cost wasn't being properly calibrated. "No one knew where to price the risk. I took that as a challenge."
Mr. Litterman started applying methods he had used to assess risk on Wall Street. Many conventional models of climate change, including other carbon-tax proposals, factor in too much certainty into future outcomes, he said. Because of that, they don't apply a high enough price on carbon right now.
Instead, the models should take into account periods of extreme volatility in global circumstances -- just like the stock market has seen in recent months. The world needs to do the same with climate change, Mr. Litterman argues.

Syrians Face Trial
For State Torture
The first trial on Syrian state torture began Thursday in Germany, in what lawyers and human-rights groups see as a test case for the role European courts can play in accountability for war crimes committed in the Syrian conflict.
The main defendant, Anwar Raslan, led an investigations unit of the Syrian intelligence service and is charged with committing crimes against humanity, 58 counts of murder, rape and grave sexual assault. The other defendant is a lower-ranking officer who, according to the German charges, helped catch antigovernment demonstrators. The two men remain in jail and haven't yet entered a plea.
There has been nearly no accountability for war crimes committed during Syria's more than nine-year conflict, which has left nearly half a million dead.

ISRAEL
EU Warns Against
Annexation Plan
The European Union on Thursday issued a warning against the incoming Israeli government's intention to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, saying that such a move "would constitute a serious violation of international law."
The EU's foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the 27-member bloc does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Palestinian territory.
Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz signed a coalition agreement that includes a clause to advance plans to annex parts of the West Bank, including Israeli settlements, starting on July 1.
Israel captured the West Bank during the 1967 Mideast war. Since then, more than 700,000 Israelis have moved into settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Pandemic Forces
Youth Protest Online
Youth groups are moving a long-planned global climate protest online Friday to skirt restrictions on public assemblies during the coronavirus pandemic, though some symbolic stunts will take place offline too.
The student group Fridays for Future, whose Greta Thunberg-inspired street protests have in the past drawn huge crowds world-wide, said it would use online streaming and videos on social media to demand more action from leaders to curb global warming.
Ms. Thunberg said Wednesday during an online event for Earth Day that the climate crisis "may not be as immediate as the corona crisis but we need to tackle this now otherwise it will be irreversible."
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets for the last global climate protest in November.

Full text: Three of Joe Biden's top aides are calling left-leaning organizations and Bernie Sanders surrogates. Co-chairs of the Biden and Sanders campaigns are contacting Congress members who backed the Vermont senator. Another congressman is reassuring local organizations of the former vice president's progressive credentials.
Mr. Biden's team is ramping up its outreach to liberals, trying to ease tensions between the Democratic establishment and left-leaning activists and young people as he works to build a coalition to defeat GOP President Trump. Mr. Biden has earned endorsements from his top competitors for the presidential nomination, including Mr. Sanders and fellow liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but he hasn't won over all of their former backers.
Senior advisers Symone Sanders and Cristobal Alex and policy director Stef Feldman have taken the lead on reaching out to organizations that backed Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren. Those conversations are in early stages; some liberal groups contacted by The Wall Street Journal said they were still working to schedule meetings.
Mr. Biden's policy plans include expanding Medicare to more Americans, and he has proposed new spending to fight climate change, but his proposals in both areas aren't as sweeping as many liberals prefer. Ms. Sanders, who isn't related to the Vermont senator but worked on his 2016 bid, said her message has been that Mr. Biden's ideas are "in fact a bold platform."
"For the people that might feel as though they are in a different place than Vice President Biden, it is our campaign's job to go out there and get the vote," she said.
The challenge facing Mr. Biden is to engage liberals in the party without jeopardizing the support of the older, more moderate voters who turned out in droves in suburban areas and helped make him the party's presumptive nominee. Mr. Trump's campaign is already seeking to paint Mr. Biden as too liberal for most voters.
Meanwhile, though many disappointed supporters of Mr. Sanders are likely to vote for the nominee, lawmakers and activists say Mr. Biden needs to boost enthusiasm among groups that typically vote at low rates, such as young people. He will also need to motivate them to volunteer and donate money.
An aide said the campaign views outreach to Democratic groups in two buckets. One is what the campaign calls "new movement groups," many of which popped up after the 2016 election and are often more liberal. The campaign also is focused on traditional Democratic groups, such as Planned Parenthood.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a surrogate for Mr. Sanders, said she heard from the Biden campaign before the Vermont lawmaker dropped out last week. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, a co-chair of Mr. Biden's campaign, connected Ms. Jayapal with Ms. Sanders, who said Mr. Biden was adopting into his education platform parts of her and Mr. Sanders's 2017 bill proposing free college for families making less than $125,000 a year.
More recently, Ms. Jayapal said she hasn't received formal outreach from the campaign, though the Washington state lawmaker is eager to speak with Mr. Biden.
"While I absolutely will be endorsing the vice president and trying to help him in every way I can to win, it's not a light switch," Ms. Jayapal said. "It's not like we just say, you know, 'I now endorse Joe Biden, everyone else should.' People really have to feel that energy."
Messrs. Biden and Sanders said Monday that they would form half a dozen task forces of people representing each man's political views to help bridge the gap between their policy plans. They haven't yet named task-force members.
Several liberal advocacy groups, including some already in talks with the campaign, sent a letter to Mr. Biden last week urging him to adopt policy positions in line with Mr. Sanders on issues such as health care, climate change and immigration.
Evan Weber, political director of the climate-focused organization Sunrise Movement, said the campaign said more information on youth engagement was coming. In addition to requests from the coalition, Mr. Weber's group wants Mr. Biden to promise to use his executive authority, if elected, to stop all new fossil fuel infrastructure. Cristina Jimenez, executive director of immigrant-rights group United We Dream, said she wants Mr. Biden to commit to stopping deportations and ending detention for undocumented immigrants.
Rep. Ruben Gallego (D., Ariz.), a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who endorsed Mr. Biden, said he hears similar requests from local officials and organizations. He said he emphasizes that Mr. Biden has addressed some issues they care about, such as his announcement that he would put a moratorium on deportations for 100 days, if elected.
"A lot of this stuff is going back and reinforcing to them things that they haven't heard or just don't believe," Mr. Gallego said.
Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Mr. Biden's campaign, has been in contact with Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who held the same position on Mr. Sanders's campaign. Mr. Richmond said the pair are reaching out to colleagues who backed the senator to urge them to voice support for Mr. Biden.
"I have great confidence that the Biden campaign will be a broad coalition, will have people having a seat at the table," Mr. Khanna said. "And I will be doing everything I can to support the vice president in whatever they want me to do."

Full text: Bernie Sanders's allies are aiming to cement his legacy as the politician who pushed the Democratic Party to the left on health care, climate and more now that Joe Biden has been established as the presumptive nominee for president.
For now, they are encouraging the former vice president to adopt more liberal policies. And they hope other progressive candidates can build on the movement Mr. Sanders launched five years ago and dethrone the party's establishment leaders.
Mr. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, dropped out of the race Wednesday. After a string of defeats last month in which he was unable to turn out the coalition of young, working-class and minority voters he said he needed to win, Mr. Sanders lagged significantly behind Mr. Biden in Democratic polling in Wisconsin, which held its primary Tuesday but isn't set to release results until next week.
However, what the senator describes as a revolution has shifted Democrats to the left on core economic issues, shaken up their fundraising model and inspired similarly liberal candidates and activists around the country. Many of them have been unsuccessful, but some -- such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- scored high-profile victories that are starting to reshape the Democratic Party.
"Bernie was alone in the wilderness . . . for 40-plus years," said Paco Fabian, director of campaigns for Our Revolution, a progressive group Mr. Sanders and his wife started after his unsuccessful 2016 presidential run. "He's no longer just a lone voice."
Jane O'Meara Sanders, Mr. Sanders's wife and most trusted adviser, said his movement has already been successful. "During 2016, the ideas were looked at as too radical, pie in the sky. They were talked about from an establishment point of view. That's no longer the case," she said.
Before Mr. Sanders exited the race, aides to Mr. Biden had begun conversations with some progressive groups. They include the climate change-focused Sunrise Movement, which endorsed Mr. Sanders, and the grass-roots group Indivisible, which didn't endorse a candidate but gave Mr. Biden its lowest rating of the major Democratic candidates and Mr. Sanders one of the highest.
Evan Weber, political director of the Sunrise Movement, said he believes the Biden campaign is taking seriously the need to reach out to Mr. Sanders's base, but he said the conversations were in the early stages. An aide to the Biden campaign said the discussions were focused on finding areas of common ground.
Mr. Sanders's supporters say the current health-care crisis could further his progressive proposals such as a Medicare for All system, paid family leave and a higher minimum wage.
Liberal activists also say they are turning to boosting other challengers to the Democratic establishment. Last month, as Mr. Sanders endured his third straight Tuesday of presidential primary defeats, a smaller victory gave his supporters hope: Marie Newman, a businesswoman and activist who campaigned on progressive policies, defeated an eight-term moderate Democratic congressman in Illinois.
"Looking ahead under the assumption that Biden is the nominee, it becomes even more important that we have a progressive force in Congress to continue pushing the conversation," Alex Morse, the mayor of Holyoke, Mass., who is running to unseat longtime Democratic Rep. Richard Neal in a September primary, said last week.
Mr. Biden has recently shifted to the left on some policies, including backing a free-college plan for many students. Mr. Sanders has said the plan doesn't go far enough.
Mr. Biden has said he agrees with the framework of the Green New Deal, which would overhaul the economy to combat climate change, but some critics say his $1.7 trillion proposal -- with plans to leverage private-sector funds and state and local governments to total more than $5 trillion -- doesn't go far enough. Mr. Sanders had promised to invest $16.3 trillion.
"Bernie has an incredible following," Mr. Biden said Tuesday on the "Today" show. "Bernie is one of probably a half-dozen people in American history who may not be the nominee but has had an impact on American politics in a significant way, in a positive way."
The candidates inspired by Mr. Sanders, however, have a mixed record.
Justice Democrats, a group working to make Congress more liberal, landed its biggest success when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez toppled the No. 4 Democrat in the House in 2018 and became a leader for the party's left-flank. But 11 other candidates they recruited lost that year.
Mr. Sanders's organization Our Revolution endorsed 32 candidates for Congress in 2018. Of those, 10 won, four of whom were sitting members who won re-election. None flipped GOP-held seats, even as a wave of more-moderate Democrats took down Republicans.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The coronavirus crisis has brought much of American life to a halt in recent weeks. Typical business on Capitol Hill has been no exception, leaving some critical legislation unfinished.
Lawmakers left Washington last week after passing a historic $2 trillion relief package, taking with them the policy agendas Congress had been set to tackle this spring. Hearings on national security have been postponed, negotiations on energy policy and surveillance powers slowed, and oversight investigations put on hold as lawmakers have turned their full attention to the public-health and economic crisis consuming the nation.
As discussions begin on another round of coronavirus legislation, lawmakers, aides and outside experts are acknowledging that the already narrow window for making progress on a variety of other policy issues before the November election could begin to close.
"The likelihood of any major legislation passing between now and the election is basically nil.It wasn't great beforehand," said Mark Harkins, a former congressional staffer and senior fellow at Georgetown's Government Affairs Institute.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) told House Democrats in a letter Tuesday that April 20 is the earliest the House would return to Washington, writing that the House may extend workweeks later in the year and cancel planned breaks to make up for lost time.
"In addition to continuing to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, we need to handle the normal annual business of Congress," he wrote.
The House left Washington without renewing expired surveillance powers, alarming current and former law-enforcement officials. The Senate and House Armed Services Committees have suspended traditional hearings and markups on the annual defense authorization bill, which establishes funding levels and sets policies for the Defense Department and Energy Department's national security programs. The House Appropriations Committee will only begin formal hearings on annual spending legislation when the House is back in session.
After the end of the third-ever presidential impeachment trial, House members and senators had both been eager to turn to fresh legislative topics. The outbreak of Covid-19 has quickly pitched Congress again into crisis mode.
"All focus right now is on the double-barreled nature of the coronavirus crisis," said Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.), the No. 3 Republican in the Senate.
Both the House and Senate had been set to consider energy and climate issues, though those efforts have been overtaken by the virus's spread. An energy package aimed at modernizing the electrical grid and supporting carbon-free energy sources in the Senate, which failed to clear procedural hurdles last month, is now on hold, according to people familiar with the bill. A House panel dedicated to studying climate change has delayed the release of its policy recommendations because of the spread of Covid-19.
"It's about taking care of your neighbors and saving lives right now, there will be a time when we come back to our climate action plan," said Rep. Kathy Castor (D., Fla.), chairwoman of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
Politically charged investigative efforts have also come to a standstill. The House Judiciary Committee postponed a March 31 hearing with Attorney General William Barr, who was set to face questions about the Justice Department's sentencing of Roger Stone, a confidant of President Trump.
The GOP-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is conducting a probe of Hunter Biden's service on the board of a Ukrainian natural-gas company, is primarily focused on the coronavirus crisis but will continue work on the probe long term, according to a committee aide.
But the prospect of another round of major coronavirus legislation has also created opportunities for progress on some policy items. Rep. Dan Kildee (D., Mich.), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said Congress could take action on surprise medical billing as part of the next bill.
"In a period of uncertainty sometimes it shakes loose some of the reticence to act," he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is completing new rules on tailpipe emissions that would slash the emissions targets auto makers must reach over the next five years, according to people familiar with the situation.
The rules would require auto makers to achieve 1.5% annual increases in fleetwide fuel efficiency through 2026, using an industry measure that takes both gas mileage and emissions reductions into account, the people said.
That requirement would be down from a 5% annual increase in efficiency mandated by the Obama administration. Under that former standard, auto makers were expected to produce a roughly 3% increase in fuel efficiency in the current model year, before more stringent targets kick in.
Challenges are likely from environmentalists and several states led by California, which has long imposed tougher emissions standards. The Trump administration has separately moved to establish federal supremacy, stripping California's authority to set more stringent vehicle-emission standards for greenhouse gases.
That move has drawn a challenge in federal court.
In easing the requirements, Trump administration officials note the industry was struggling to meet the increasing mandate and say the compromise sets attainable limits while still ensuring progress on environmental protection.
The administration also says the policy will make new cars more affordable, boosting vehicle sales and the frequency with which consumers replace older vehicles with more efficient models.
Critics of the rule say the loss in efficiency will be more expensive for consumers over time and that it is a setback in efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and slow climate change.
California has said it would challenge efforts to weaken the rules. A spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra says more urgency exists now -- amid the novel coronavirus pandemic -- to defend all policies that affect public health.
"The crippling consequences of the Trump administration's weakening of our nation's health and safety standards are unfolding before our eyes," Mr. Becerra said in a statement. He declined to comment further until after the administration officially announces the details of its rule.
Environmental groups have been expecting the decision.
"Of all the bad things President Trump has done to the environment, this is the worst," Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign for the Center for Auto Safety, said in a statement. "He is rolling back the biggest single step any nation has taken to fight global warming, cut oil use and save money at the pump."
Auto makers have been divided over the administration's policy. Many had asked President Trump for relief from the more stringent rules they initially agreed to when the Obama administration adopted them in 2012. But some have balked when the administration responded with an early proposal to eliminate rising standards altogether.
Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW AG and Volkswagen AG went so far as to strike a deal with California to follow its tailpipe-emissions standards beyond those proposed by the Trump administration. Months later, rivals including General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV took the opposite position, intervening in a lawsuit to side with the administration's position that the rules should be set by U.S. regulators, not states.

Full text: Millennials face an ethical conundrum. On the one hand, they express a desire to travel more than previous generations. At the same time, though, they also are more passionate about the environment.
Those two things don't always go well together.
In fact, as flying comes under increased scrutiny for its carbon footprint and once-unspoiled places grow ever more crowded, many young adults find themselves struggling to balance two of their most cherished passions.
It is a challenge Christine Williams and her partner, Jules Hatfield, face often. Since 2012, the two have traveled together, shared their adventures and promoted responsible tourism, building an online following that reaches 80,000 people on Instagram.
Like many in her generation, the 32-year-old Ms. Williams is trying to reconcile a yearning to see the world with her environmental values.
"The only true environmentally friendly way to travel is to stay at home," she says. But traveling also has a positive side in that it can spur local economies, she says, and "if you are having some sort of positive impact then it's a good thing."
For many millennials, staying home isn't an option. More than one-third of millennials save only so they can travel when not working, compared with just 10% of baby boomers, and one-fifth of millennials say they are planning to use some of an inheritance to travel around the world, a survey for The Wall Street Journal conducted by MarketCast found.
They may not be willing to stay home, but many millennials will make trade-offs to stay true to their values while on the road. And that, travel experts say, has the potential to reshape the travel and tourism industry in significant ways.
For instance, frequent travelers are now confronting a "flight shaming" movement that encourages people to fly less to fight climate change. Aviation accounts for more than 2% of global human-produced carbon-dioxide emissions, and is one of the fastest-growing sources of CO2, according to the European Commission.
The flight-shaming trend may be more prevalent in Europe than in the U.S. but it has airlines on both sides of the Atlantic on alert. Flight shaming could halve air traffic growth in Europe, while also hitting domestic flights in the U.S., a UBS survey released in September showed.
"This issue presents a clear and present danger if we don't get on top of it," Robin Hayes, chief executive of JetBlue Airways Corp., said on an earnings conference call in January.
In response, airlines in recent years have pledged to reduce their emissions. Delta Air Lines Inc. has committed $1 billion to become carbon neutral by 2030, and many global carriers, including Deutsche Lufthansa AG, easyJet PLC and United Airlines Holdings Inc., have ramped up investments in carbon-offset programs and fuel-saving technologies.
Airlines are betting such moves will resonate with millennials, many of whom aren't ready to give up their airline seats but are embracing greener options whenever possible.
More than half of millennials choose eco-friendly transportation and accommodations when traveling, a 2019 survey from travel commerce platform Travelport shows. That can include taking trains instead of planes and staying in sustainability-certified hotels, where accommodations are designed to reduce customers' carbon footprints. Here again, millennials are leading the way compared with other generations, according to the survey.
Matthew Kepnes, a 38-year-old travel writer, says there are things travelers can do "that can have a strong impact on reducing your carbon emissions." For instance, he says he tries to avoid animal tourism and brings a refillable water bottle when traveling to avoid plastic waste.
The rise of social media-fueled tourism also poses environmental challenges. Many millennial travelers get their inspiration from social networks, creating a competition as to who can post the best pictures -- to the detriment of the environment.
"People want that perfect Instagram photo and they will go off trails to get it," says Ms. Williams.
Competing for the best picture can transform unspoiled places into crowded, touristy ones. Mount Everest, once unaffected by tourism, has suffered from hundreds of climbers discarding their trash on the slopes every year as they attempt the treacherous trek, leading officials to announce a ban on single-use plastics in the region.
With the U.N. World Tourism Organization forecasting a 3% to 4% increase in international tourist arrivals world-wide in 2020, and many millennials wanting to travel in a more sustainable way, some experts see an opportunity for tours, accommodations and destinations labeled as green.
The challenge will be to identify the places and business that are actually green, as opposed to those that claim to be. "It is easy to fall for hotels that are saying they are eco-friendly and they are not really," Ms. Williams says.

Full text: Millennials may be more passionate about environmental and social-justice causes than previous generations, but those values have yet to make a significant impact on how they invest.
Part of the disconnect, according to a survey conducted in September 2019 for The Wall Street Journal by MarketCast, is that many millennials simply aren't familiar with socially responsible investing or don't want to commit to it until they become more financially literate.
Katie Irwin, a 33-year-old accountant who works for the state of Colorado, has been investing for three years. She says that while she cares about how her investments might impact the causes she supports, she needs to learn more about finance before she starts investing based on environmental, social or governance (ESG) criteria.
"I want to be able to understand where and why and what I am investing in," says Ms. Irwin, who has a pension plan through her job and a target-date fund through Vanguard Group.
It is a familiar theme for many in her generation.
According to the survey, the top passion causes among millennials, defined as those born between 1981 and 1996, are climate change at 41%, followed by human rights, poverty reduction and safe work environment, each at 39%, and environment sustainability at 38%.
The same survey also found that nearly half of millennials want to start investing but don't know where to begin, and an overwhelming 87% of millennials had never heard of ESG investing. After the concept was explained to them, 44% said they would be interested in socially responsible investments vs. roughly a quarter of Gen-Xers and baby boomers.
"With some continued confidence and education, we may see ESG funds grow among millennials as the interest is there, but the familiarity isn't," says Kelly Lanan, vice president for young investors at Fidelity Investments Inc. Among Fidelity's millennial clients, none of the top 10 most popular passive mutual funds by invested assets focus on sustainability.
Among millennials who do invest, work-sponsored 401(k) plans are the most popular financial product at 41%, the survey found, followed by individual retirement accounts at 25%. About 19% say they invest in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, while 15% invest in individual stocks.
Nina Gunderson, a 27-year-old financial adviser at UBS in New York, began investing through a work-sponsored retirement plan. She says buying stocks in environmentally and socially progressive companies doesn't drive her portfolio.
"I'm trying to think about investments where they provide stability, where there's opportunity for growth," she says.
ESG investments are rarely found in 401(k) plans and IRAs, according to the American Retirement Association's Plan Sponsor Council of America. In 2018, only 2.9% of 401(k) plans had an ESG fund in their lineup, while the group estimates that just 0.1% of total IRA plan assets were in ESG funds.
For now, the choice for many millennials is target-date funds, which grow less risky as a target date approaches. Target-date funds are the default option in many company-sponsored retirement plans.
Fidelity, which manages about $3.2 trillion, says that 58% of millennial assets in its 401(k) plans were in target-date funds at the end of 2019. Among millennials who have all of their savings in 401(k)s, the share rose to 70%.
Among millennials whose investments are self-directed, holdings skew heavily toward trendy technology companies. The top stocks they held as of the end of December were Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Tesla Inc., Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp., according to a survey by Apex Clearing of more than 730,000 U.S. investor accounts with an average age of 31 years and 3 months. The average account held about $2,300.
While many of these companies often appear in the holdings of ESG funds, there is nothing to suggest millennials are buying them for that reason.
Of the top 100 stocks held by millennial investors surveyed by Apex, 30% of holdings were in tech companies, 25% were services companies and 24% were consumer-goods firms. Bringing up the rear were utilities at 0.2%, basic materials at 1.5% and industrial goods at 3.3%. Oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and BP PLC also made the list.
Lucas Brito, 28, is one of these young investors who has a penchant for tech companies. He has traded Facebook stock in the past despite concerns about the company's handling of user data, but has donated his earnings from Facebook to causes he cares about. "If they hold so much of my data and are making a profit off my data, I might as well get a cut of the pie," Mr. Brito says.
He started trading stocks back in 2018 for fun, realizing it wasn't so different than selling in-game credits on the popular online game "World of Warcraft." "It's like a virtual casino," he says.
Mr. Brito, who works for a videogame company in Shanghai, China, says he and his fellow millennials are comfortable with tech companies because they grew up with them and understand their products. He also thinks the sector has had exceptional growth compared with industries such as oil.
"How can you say it's a bad investment to invest in them? All the big four grew so much in the last few years. When you compare [them] to oil, you're sort of like, 'Huh.' "
Many millennials say they have too much student debt to even think about investing. Some 34% of the millennials in the Journal survey say they have so much student-loan debt that it's a challenge to save for the future, while another 52% "feel overwhelmed by financial burdens."
"If you have debt, it's literally just going to be a wash if you're putting that into the market," says Lauren Simmons, who at age 22 became the youngest trader and the second black woman to work on the New York Stock Exchange floor.
Now 25, Ms. Simmons is working to launch a TV show to help young people with their finances.
"Having a conversation about millennials and investing is tricky because most of them are not in a position where they should be investing," she says.
That situation might soon shift, however. It is estimated that millennials as a whole will inherit trillions of dollars from their parents, in what is expected to be the largest wealth transfer in history, says Danan Kirby, a 35-year-old client portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M.
Mr. Kirby, who has been promoting investing based on ESG for more than 10 years, believes that once millennials have more assets and become more educated about finance, they will put money into socially responsible investments. "It will transfer into investing because it's already in the millennial's mind-set," he says.
Thornburg's clients, who are mostly financial advisers, are increasingly seeking to recast their practices around sustainability as they prepare for a wave of millennial clients, Mr. Kirby says. Those advisers could be well-positioned to attract the quarter of millennials in the WSJ survey who say they prefer to go to a financial expert to learn about finance.
"The industry at large needs to do a much better job communicating with millennials as a whole about investments in general. Quite specifically, sustainability," Mr. Kirby says.

Full text: MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- Tensions are coming to a head as this city prepares for new infrastructure projects designed to fortify the low-lying island against increased flooding and sea-level rise.
Climate experts praise Miami Beach -- a diverse, international city in South Florida with wealthy sections -- for devoting $1 billion to tackle the problem, and other coastal communities look to it as a model. But some residents say plans to raise roads as much as about 5 feet above sea level and add storm-water pumps with generators the size of vans are an unsightly intrusion and a potential drag on property values.
The conflict presents the mayor and city commissioners with a dilemma: How far can they go in accommodating homeowners' concerns without undercutting the city's long-term viability?
"We will have to have the political will to make unpopular decisions," said City Commissioner Ricky Arriola. "Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence and engineering solutions proposed, there is going to be a group of our citizens who want us to do nothing."
Cities around the U.S., including New York, Norfolk, Va., and Charleston, S.C., confront similar challenges. Because Miami Beach is farther along than many of them in feeling the effects of climate change and trying to respond, its experience could hold lessons.
Lying an average of about 4 feet above sea level on porous limestone, Miami Beach is especially vulnerable. Sea levels are projected to increase as much as 21 inches by 2040 and 54 inches by 2070, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., an engineering firm hired by Miami Beach to review its climate-adaptation strategy, is expected to release its final recommendations in the next few weeks after a yearlong study. When the firm offered a preview of its proposals for road-raising and other projects at a recent public meeting, homeowners balked.
"Until we've figured out how to keep private properties dry, we should not be spending a fortune on raising streets in the entire city," said resident Hal Phillips.
In 2014, the city embarked on a plan to address more frequent and intense downpours by installing bigger storm-water pipes and new pump stations to push rainwater out to sea. It also began elevating sea walls and raising roads in the lowest-lying areas to address sea-level rise. The roughly $1 billion program is funded by a combination of sources, including bonds and residential and business utility fees.
The Sunset Harbour neighborhood, which overlooks Biscayne Bay and often flooded during the highest tides, was the first commercial and condo area where these measures were implemented.
Since January 2017, after the project was completed, the area has avoided 85 flooding incidents that would have occurred without the changes, said Roy Coley, the city's public works director.
A January study commissioned by the city and led by consulting firm ICF International Inc. estimated that raising roads in the neighborhood increased condo values 11.9%.
After Mayor Dan Gelber was elected in 2017, he invited several organizations to examine the city's approach to resiliency, including the nonprofit Urban Land Institute, which largely praised it. Last year, the city hired Jacobs Engineering Group.
Not all of the firm's suggestions are controversial. Some of them involve "blue-green infrastructure," which mimics natural defenses against flooding risks. They include "bioswales," or vegetated channels along streets, and a new park with ponds -- proposals aimed at collecting and cleaning storm water.
The recommendations that have proved most divisive are those involving elevated roads in single-family neighborhoods.
Some residents argue that by raising the street above the level where houses sit, storm water will flow down and inundate properties -- a claim the city disputes. That, in turn, will depress real-estate values, they say.
"We're under siege," said Bob Kunst, who lives in the affluent Lakeview area in the middle of Miami Beach. "The city's approach to this has jeopardized everybody."
Nearly two years ago, when the city first proposed elevating streets in the Lakeview area, Mr. Kunst and other residents formed an organization to fight the effort. They battled a rival neighborhood group that supported the road-raising plan. The city ended up postponing the project.

Hotter Climate Raised
Risk of Fires: Study
Climate change raised the chances of Australia's extreme fire season by at least 30%, according to a study released by climate scientists at the World Weather Attribution group.
Scientists from Australia, Europe and North America calculated how much human-caused global warming elevated the likelihood of Australia's record-setting fire season by comparing high-resolution computer models of the continent facing varying levels of climate change.
The scientists took into account differences in climate conditions in about 1900 compared with current conditions -- tabulating both measured and observed changes in temperature, drought and fire intensity.
Last year was both the hottest and driest year on record in Australia since measurements began a century ago.
"There is evidence that Australian fire seasons have lengthened and become more intense -- and extreme temperatures have played a role in this," said Sophie Lewis, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, Australia, and a co-author of the study.
"Climate change is now part of Australia's landscape -- extreme heat is clearly influenced by human-caused climate change, which can influence fire conditions," she said.

DUBAI
U.K. Court Says Ruler
Abducted Daughters
The ruler of Dubai conducted a campaign of fear and intimidation against his estranged wife and ordered the abduction of two of his daughters, a British judge ruled in documents that were unsealed Thursday.
A judge at the High Court in London found that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum "acted in a manner from the end of 2018 which has been aimed at intimidating and frightening" his ex-wife Princess Haya.
Judge Andrew McFarlane also said the sheikh "ordered and orchestrated" the abductions and forced return to Dubai of two of his adult daughters from another marriage: Sheikha Shamsa in August 2000, and Sheikha Latifa in 2002 and again in 2018.
The judge made rulings in December and January after a battle between the estranged spouses over the welfare of their two children, but the sheikh fought to prevent them from being made public. The U.K. Supreme Court quashed that attempt on Thursday.
In a statement after the rulings were published, the sheikh said that "as a head of government, I was not able to participate in the court's fact-finding process. This has resulted in the release of a 'fact-finding' judgment which inevitably only tells one side of the story."

PHILIPPINES
Police Chief Survives
Helicopter Crash
A helicopter carrying the Philippine national police chief and seven other people crashed after hitting a power cable on takeoff, critically injuring two other generals on board.
Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa and the others were pulled from the wreckage by police officers on a village road in San Pedro city in Laguna province, south of Manila. Gen. Gamboa was injured in the shoulder and right arm but flashed a thumbs-up and said, "I'm OK" while being wheeled to an ambulance.
In a video shown by the DZMM network, Gen. Gamboa said from his hospital bed that he would report back to work on Monday and asked for prayers for those hospitalized.
Two passengers -- Maj. Gen. Mariel Magaway and Maj. Gen. Jose Ma. Victor Ramos -- were in critical condition, while the rest, including the police spokesman and the police flight crew, were in stable condition, police Maj. Gen. Benigno Durana Jr. said.
The aircraft took off from a police compound in Laguna and hit a power cable before crashing onto a road near houses, witness Glenda Garcia said. No one on the ground was hurt by the crash.
Gen. Gamboa took over the national police force in October when his predecessor retired early after being linked to illegal drugs.

Full text: The rapid ascent of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries -- despite a weak showing in Saturday's South Carolina vote -- confronts American business with the once unthinkable: The most powerful policy maker in the world could soon be a strident, lifelong critic of capitalism and big business.
Current and former business leaders and analysts have greeted the prospect with a mix of concern, skepticism and disbelief. Most doubt the Vermont independent, who calls himself a democratic socialist and caucuses with Democrats, could win against President Trump in November, and if he does, could not or would not implement his boldest ideas.
If they are wrong, some see an existential threat. For most businesses, contingency planning boils down to one word: Congress. Health companies assume a Republican-controlled Senate would block Medicare for All, which would ban private insurance.
If, along with a Sanders win, the Democrats take both the House and Senate, "There would be a close to apoplectic reaction" in the health-care sector, said Chet Burrell, former chief executive of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, which offers coverage in Maryland and the Washington, D.C., area. "There would be an intense effort to intercede. . .and shape what would happen."
In energy, Mr. Sanders seeks to shut down the extraction of oil and gas, in particular by banning hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," of shale deposits, to deal with climate change.
"The shale revolution has created many, many jobs in the last decade," said J. Nelson Wood, chief executive of Wood Energy Inc., a small oil and gas producer in Illinois, that employs 25 people and operates 200 wells. "That effectively ends if his policies are implemented."
Mr. Sanders and his supporters argue policies under past presidents of both parties have disproportionately benefited the wealthy and corporations while ordinary workers' wages stagnated. They say his policies would address essential needs such as health insurance and climate change. They say jobs lost would be more than offset by jobs gained elsewhere.
They also play down the socialist label. Mr. Sanders has said he doesn't want the government to take over the means of production, the textbook definition of socialism. "What democratic socialism is about is saying, 'Let's use the federal government to protect the interests of working families,' " he said on "60 Minutes."
"If you're a modern day robber baron, then the policies of a Bernie Sanders administration will not be to your liking," said Josh Orton, Mr. Sanders's policy director, in an interview. "If you are a small or medium-size businessthat desperately needs infrastructure, [such as] high-speed internet access to prosper in rural areas, or a manufacturing company or worker sick of free-trade agreements that have offshored production, then you will like the agenda of a Bernie Sanders administration."
Mr. Sanders places himself in the tradition of previous Democratic presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt -- whose policies, Mr. Sanders has noted, were often labeled socialism. Mr. Roosevelt eschewed the socialist label even as he created a social safety net and enacted sweeping curbs on business.While running for re-election in 1936, he claimed, "The old enemies of peace: business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. . .are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred."
Today, critics on the right predict Mr. Sanders's policies would be catastrophic for the economy. Casey Mulligan, an economist at the University of Chicago who served in Mr. Trump's White House, predicted Mr. Sanders's policies would significantly shrink gross domestic product by discouraging work and investment with higher taxes and by replacing private ownership in some industries with less efficient public ownership.
Left-of-center economists dismiss those estimates as unfounded. Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who has advised Mr. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another presidential candidate, on tax policy, noted in Scandinavia, which has an economic system closest to what Mr. Sanders seeks, average income per adult and average wealth per adult are about the same as in the U.S. He said broadening access to education and health care historically has helped growth, and he said Medicare for All would significantly boost household purchasing power by eliminating insurance premiums.
Only once has Mr. Sanders ever actually held the reins of government, as mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989. "Bernie understood that you need business making a profit in order to do the social, environmental and cultural good that he espouses," said Tom Torti, current president of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, who has known Mr. Sanders since then and is neutral in the current race.
At the time, a private businessman wanted to redevelop the waterfront. Mr. Sanders intervened to favor a different plan that resulted in below-market rate boat slips for local residents, public access and a community sailing center, Mr. Torti said. It is now "a profitable development," he said. "People make money. It's capitalism working with a social conscience."
Nowadays, Mr. Sanders seldom utters the word capitalism without modifiers like "unfettered," "out of control" and "casino." By contrast, Ms. Warren, who advocates many of the same policies, such as Medicare for All, calls herself a "capitalist to my bones."
Yet business and investors have been less exercised about Mr. Sanders's rise to front-runner than when Ms. Warren briefly reached the same position last fall.
Sarah Bianchi, a policy analyst at broker Evercore ISI, said one reason is that they thought Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Trump, but that Mr. Sanders couldn't. Prediction markets show that as the probability of Mr. Sanders winning the nomination rose clearly above 50% this year, so did the probability of Mr. Trump being re-elected.
Another reason, Ms. Bianchi said, is that Ms. Warren's affinity for the minutiae of policy suggests she would be more determined and effective at implementing her ideas.
By contrast, Mr. Sanders has been criticized for his lack of detail, in particular how he will pay for his programs. Cornerstone Macro, an investment research firm, estimates Mr. Sanders's promises would cost $67 trillion over the coming decade, but his tax increases would raise less than half that.
Mr. Sanders told "60 Minutes" he didn't have a price tag for all of his proposals but said "we have options out there" to finance Medicare for All. These include income-based premiums on individuals and employers that, his campaign said, would be lower than what most now pay in premiums.
Mr. Sanders has proposed sharply cutting drug costs, which he says are inflated by pharmaceutical companies, to what other wealthy countries pay. He would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and allow importation of drugs from other countries, and set prices according to an index based on international rates.
Ian Spatz, a health-care consultant, said the moves would hurt the development of new medicines. "When push comes to shove, do members of Congress want to kill the goose that lays the golden pharmaceutical eggs," he said.
Even without passing Medicare for All, Mr. Sanders could crimp health insurers' growth or margins through regulatory actions -- for instance, tweaking the rules on how they manage the private version of Medicare plans, a key business for the industry.
In energy, Mr. Sanders would withhold federal permits for any fossil-fuel infrastructure such as pipelines. He would also require electricity and transportation to be entirely based on renewable energy by 2030. Yet the necessary technology, such as for electric cars that are affordable for most consumers and profitable for manufacturers, doesn't yet exist.
"Nothing he does and says will make cars and trucks move without gasoline," said Chris Wright, chief executive of Liberty Oilfield Services, which operates fracking equipment. "All he can do is harm domestic production, drive up prices, and turn us from an exporter to importer."
Mr. Sanders's campaign proposes "massive investments in research and development" to "drastically reduce" the cost of energy storage and electric vehicles.
Kevin Book, research director at ClearView Energy Partners, an energy research firm, said a ban on private fracking wouldn't pass Congress so long as the Senate requires 60 votes for major legislation, and Trump-appointed judges would likely curb overly expansive regulatory action.
Mr. Book said that, much as Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border to justify redirecting federal funds to build a wall, Mr. Sanders could use his proposed designation of climate change as a national emergency to ban fossil fuel exports and shut down offshore drilling.
Mr. Orton of the Sanders campaign said that because scientists say the world has a tight window to take action before climate change does irreparable damage, "We are not going to let the fossil-fuel industry complain that we're not going to compromise. They were uncompromising in their greed for the 40 years that they spent causing this crisis."
Some of the fiercest opposition to Mr. Sanders comes from Wall Street. In an op-ed in Time Magazine, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon said socialism would be "a disaster for our country." Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, a lifelong Democrat, told the Financial Times "I might find it harder to vote for Bernie than for Trump."
Mr. Sanders, who advocates the Depression-era separation of banks and securities dealers and a tax on financial transactions, has reveled in their criticism. He has shot back at Mr. Blankfein on Twitter with barbs about his pay. One of his ads called Mr. Dimon "the biggest corporate socialist" in the country, citing the financial-crisis era bank bailouts and fines. JPMorgan has said it didn't need a bailout in 2008 and accepted one only at the urging of the Treasury, and quickly repaid it.
Yet some on Wall Street don't consider Mr. Sanders much more risky than other Democratic candidates, all of whom, including Mr. Bloomberg, have promised to tax or regulate finance more. "No one is freaking out," said one banker. "It will be tougher under a Democratic president, but it can be tougher in a 100 different ways." Most presidents, he said, have only enough political capital to accomplish one or two big things in their first term, and Mr. Sanders is likely to spend his on health care rather than banking, which has attracted little attention in the campaign.
Compared to energy and health care, Mr. Sanders's ideas for remaking corporate governance have drawn less attention but are potentially more sweeping. He proposes that employees own at least 20% of large or public companies' shares and elect 45% of their directors. Companies that lay off employees because of foreign outsourcing or automation would have to issue them shares as compensation. Companies with larger gaps between executive and worker pay would pay higher tax rates. A new federal charter, mandatory for large and public companies, would require boards to consider the interests not just of shareholders, but of workers, customers and communities. Companies could be required to include women and minorities on boards.
Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said increased stock ownership by middle- and lower-income Americans could help offset rising income and wealth inequality, while rules "that would push big business to improve diversity could be helpful in addressing multiple dimensions of inequality over time."
Corporate governance experts said the plans would create internal governance problems. Employees wouldn't be independent directors, so conflict-of-interest rules would prevent them from serving on committees overseeing audits, board nominations and executive compensation, "which is where the critical work of the company gets done," said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors.
Issuing 20% of shares to employees would, by diluting existing shareholders' returns, make a company's stock less attractive, encouraging it to issue more debt, said Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University. That would make it more leveraged and vulnerable to bankruptcy, he said.
And shareholders would likely sue to contest the expropriation of ownership and control from existing shareholders to employees, said B. Espen Eckbo, a finance professor who founded Dartmouth College's corporate-governance research center.

Troops Planned
For Sahel Region
African leaders have decided to deploy 3,000 troops to West Africa's troubled Sahel region as extremist attacks surge, an African Union official said.
The force would be a significant new player in the region south of the Sahara where fighters linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State killed thousands of people last year.
The decision comes as the U.S. is considering shrinking its military presence in Africa.
Smail Chergui, the African Union commissioner for peace and security, relayed the troop decision taken at a recent AU summit to visiting European Union officials on Thursday.
The force would join France's largest overseas military operation, the 5,100-strong Barkhane, and the 15,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force in Mali, one of the countries hit hardest by the attacks along with Burkina Faso and Niger.

GREECE
Protests Continue
On Eastern Islands
Demonstrators protested for a fourth consecutive day on the eastern Greek islands of Lesbos and Chios against government plans to build new migrant detention centers.
The protests come amid growing anger and occasional violence on islands that are the main entry point for tens of thousands of people seeking better lives in Europe.
Shops and services were shut on Lesbos as workers extended an initial 24-hour strike into a second day as part of the protests.
The mayors of Lesbos, Chios and the nearby island of Samos met with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis Thursday evening, and agreed on "the need to immediately ease overcrowding on the islands," the prime minister's office said.

UNITED KINGDOM
Court Stalls Plan
For Airport Expansion
Heathrow Airport's plans to increase the capacity of Europe's biggest travel hub by more than 50% were stalled when a British court said the government failed to consider its commitment to combat climate change when it approved the project.
The ruling throws in doubt the future of the 14 billion-pound ($18 billion) plan to build a third runway at Heathrow, the west London airport that already handles more than 1,300 flights a day.
While Heathrow officials said they planned to appeal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government indicated it wouldn't challenge the ruling by the Court of Appeal.
At stake is a project that business groups and Heathrow officials argue is crucial for the economy as the U.K. looks to increase links with countries from China to the U.S. after leaving the European Union. Heathrow has already reached the capacity of its current facilities, and a third runway is needed to serve the growing demands of travelers and international trade, they say.
Environmental campaigners challenged the project because of concerns that a third runway would encourage increased air travel and the carbon emissions blamed for global warming.

Full text: BERLIN -- The candidates to succeed Angela Merkel as chair of her conservative party -- and possibly as Germany's next chancellor -- are facing a daunting challenge: To recapture ground lost to the nativist right, while reversing an exodus of voters to the center-left.
The race for Ms. Merkel's successor was thrown wide open this month when her protegee and designated successor quit as head of the Christian Democratic Union after just more than a year in the job, undoing Ms. Merkel's carefully choreographed script for an orderly transition ahead of 2021 elections.
The resignation triggered a leadership contest that will decide whether the big-tent conservative party, in power since 2005, can retain its primacy in an increasingly polarized and fragmented political environment. At stake is Ms. Merkel's domination of Germany's political center.
The contest -- backroom negotiations that will culminate in a vote at a party conference any time between May and the end of the year -- takes place against the darkening backdrop of the slowing German economy.
Meanwhile, Germany and the European Union are being squeezed by the escalating confrontation between China and the U.S.
The collapse of Ms. Merkel's succession plan is rippling through the EU, which relies on Germany, its largest economy, to master challenges ranging from a looming recession to global trade tensions and military conflicts on the bloc's doorstep in the Middle East and North Africa.
Germany's leadership is more crucial now that the U.K., long the EU's second-largest economy and a diplomatic and defense heavyweight, has left the bloc. Berlin's introversion is leaving Paris without its longtime sparring partner, with which it traditionally has shaped the EU's message on foreign policy, security, trade and climate change.
Ms. Merkel, who has served as chancellor for more than 14 years on a centrist agenda, vowed not to seek re-election after her term ends in the fall of next year. She remains among the country's most popular politicians, but her popularity has faded since she opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015 in what would become her most controversial decision.
Her conservative bloc suffered even more.
The CDU went on to score its worst postwar election result in 2017 and its ratings have fallen ever since. With polls showing its share of the vote oscillating around 27%, it is still Germany's largest party but off a full 6 points since the election.
First to hit Ms. Merkel's bloc was the loss of about a million votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany, a once-obscure party with support in the low single digits that was boosted by the backlash against the chancellor's open-arms immigration policy.
Campaigning on an anti-immigration and anti-Islam ticket, the AfD, an eclectic movement that includes Nazi apologists and economic libertarians, became the biggest opposition party in parliament with nearly 13% of the votes. It now has lawmakers in all of Germany's 16 state assemblies.
In the former East German regions, the nativist party recorded its biggest successes to date, capturing nearly a quarter of the votes in some state elections, despite violating a longstanding political taboo in Germany -- questioning the consensus on its Nazi past.
Yet, the party's ratings have stagnated at a high level for the past three years. Ostracized by all other parties, it has been unable to get into governments nationally or locally. It was overtaken by the environmentalist Greens, boosted by renewed concern about climate change and broad revulsion against the far-right after a string of unconnected racist and xenophobic attacks and conspiracies rocked the country in the past year.
Since a racially motivated shooting Wednesday night that left nine dead near Frankfurt -- the worst terror act since an Islamist-inspired attack in late 2016 -- centrist politicians have denounced what they said was the AfD's role in shaping the racist psychology of the gunman. Germany's domestic intelligence agency has said it was monitoring some groupings within the party for possible extremist activities.
The AfD has rejected any connection between its position and the motivation of the attacker, who was found dead after his rampage, saying he had been mentally disturbed.
Between the general election of 2017 and the European elections last year, pollster Infratest Dimap calculated that the CDU lost 4.3 million voters, including 260,000 to the AfD and 1.1 million to the Greens. The Greens are now polling at around 22%, making the party the second-most-popular behind the CDU, according to Politico's Poll of Polls from Feb. 17.
Pollsters warn that the departure of Ms. Merkel could dent the CDU's rating further. In the monthly Politbarometer tracker of politicians' personal approval ratings, Ms. Merkel is closely followed by the leaders of the Greens.
The first candidate to step forward is Norbert Rottgen, head of parliament's foreignaffairs committee. Once a close ally of Ms. Merkel before the two fell out, Mr. Rottgen is a former environment minister and committed ally of the U.S. He is also the lead critic of Ms. Merkel's plan to allow China's Huawei Technologies Co. to build Germany's next-generation mobile network, siding with Washington's efforts to sideline the company.
Other likely contenders are Armin Laschet, premier of the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, Jens Spahn, health minister, and Friedrich Merz, a senior CDU official turned business lawyer who lost a power battle to Ms. Merkel in the early 2000s.

Full text: Investors and customers aren't the only ones pressuring big companies to address climate change -- employees are joining in too.
From Walmart Inc. to Microsoft Corp., many large companies say that commitments to curb greenhouse-gas emissions and buy green power are becoming important to recruiting and retaining workers, especially younger ones.
The issue is especially pronounced in the tech industry, where competition for skilled workers is fierce, and some employees have turned to activism to prod their employers into action.
At Amazon.com Inc., a group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice wrote an open letter last year, urging the company to commit to a deadline to secure 100% of its electricity from renewable sources. Signed by several thousand employees, the letter also called out the e-commerce giant for ordering 20,000 diesel-engine vans.
A few months later, Amazon committed to 100% renewables by 2030 and made the largest-ever order for electric delivery vehicles. Amazon said the plan "had been in the works for many years and was not a result of criticism."
Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have both made climate pledges in recent months, after employees organized and began asking for more action.
"Employees are flexing their muscle and companies are smart enough to realize that as society changes towards fighting climate change, to be on the right side of that challenge is good for business," said Matt Rogers, co-founder of Nest, the maker of smart-home devices that is now part of Google. He has since left the company.
The climate demands are part of a sea change hitting the corporate world as increasingly vocal workers demand that companies and chief executives take positions on important social and political issues. "Gone are the days where you can just go work somewhere and make good money and that is all you care about," said Jason Wingard, dean of the school of professional studies at Columbia University. "When we have our career week and we engage with employers on campus, one of the first questions students ask is: 'What do you stand for?'"
Four in five companies expect an increase in employee activism, with climate concerns as a top trigger, according to a recent survey of 375 global executives by law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP.
"We see a lot more employees using the workplace as a forum to raise social issues," said London-based partner Silke Goldberg. "They are trying to call out their employers and hold them to account for their values."
Nate Hurst, HP Inc.'s chief sustainability officer, said climate issues are central to making the 50,000 workers at the printer and computer company feel like they are part of something bigger and positive.
"One of the best ways to land top recruits and keep existing staff motivated and engaged is to help them understand how their careers and contributions are critical to HP's sustainability efforts," Mr. Hurst said.
Before a global-climate strike last September, HP sent a memo to its workers, letting them know it would be fine to attend. "You have the support of our leadership team if you choose to lend your time and voice to this important cause," the memo said. HP has committed to reduce its direct emissions by 25% by 2025 and use 40% renewable electricity by this year.
Walmart recently broke ground on a new headquarters complex with more than 20 buildings in Bentonville, Ark., that it hopes will appeal to climate-conscious workers. It will feature solar panels on parking decks, natural lighting through large windows and timber-framed buildings, a method of construction that uses fewer fossil fuels.
"We are going to create a campus where associates want to be and where we can attract the next generation of top talent," said spokeswoman Anne Hatfield. A top consideration, she said, was climate-friendly buildings.
Companies aren't always able to appease environmentally minded workers. Amazon Employees for Climate Justice recently said it would continue pressuring the company to take more action.
"As Amazon workers, we are responsible for not only the success of the company, but its impact as well. It's our moral responsibility to speak up," said Sarah Tracy, an Amazon software-development engineer.
Amazon spokeswoman Jaci Anderson said it was a violation of policy for employees to speak out against the company. Amazon "will not allow employees to publicly disparage or misrepresent the company or the hard work of their colleagues who are developing solutions to these hard problems," she said.
U.S. businesses, led by the tech industry, have been aggressive in recent years in buying electricity from wind and solar farms. Last year, companies signed deals for a record 9.3 gigawatts of renewable energy, according to the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, roughly half of average demand on the New York state power grid. The largest purchaser, for the second straight year, was Facebook Inc. Amazon, Microsoft and Google were all in the top seven.
Those kinds of commitments matter to incoming recruits such as Amanda Willis, a 29-year-old masters of business administration student at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. For her, sustainability action tops salary and location as criteria for choosing an employer this spring. "My goal is to work somewhere where I agree with their values," she said.

Developers Float Answer to Floods --- Waterborne projects are seen as a way to deal with sea levels, housing shortages

Full text: A real-estate investor is building 16 hotels for the 2022 soccer World Cup in Qatar, but they won't be there for long. All of them will be floating on water.
Admares, the Finnish company behind the project, reached a deal last month to build the temporary lodging. Chief Executive Mikael Hedberg got the idea for Admares, which specializes in floating buildings and modular construction, during his time in the shipbuilding industry and running a company to build floating housing for oil workers.
"That's when I thought, why only do it for the oil industry; why not go for the whole real-estate market'?" Mr. Hedberg said.
Each hotel in Qatar will be four stories high with 101 rooms. They will be assembled from steel and then float in the Persian Gulf. It isn't clear what would happen to the properties after the World Cup, which will last about a month.
More developers are building waterborne structures. Floating buildings can alleviate housing shortages in major cities at a time when land is scarce and restrictive zoning makes it hard to build up, said Koen Olthuis, whose Netherlands-based architecture firm Waterstudio specializes in floating structures.
For flood-prone cities like Miami, structures that rise and sink with the sea offer an alternative to waterfront construction that looks increasingly vulnerable to rising sea levels. "Climate change has definitely helped us spread our designs and ideas," Mr. Olthuis said.
So far, most of these structures are little more than elaborate houseboats. But some firms are working on multistory office, hotel and apartment buildings that could extend congested cities into the ocean.
In Rotterdam's harbor, developer RED Company is building a 54,000-square-foot, three-story, wooden, floating office building. The project, which will serve as the new headquarters of the Global Center on Adaptation, will be energy-neutral and feature solar panels and a floating swimming pool, according to the company.
GCA helps countries, companies and organizations to adapt to climate change. The center's CEO, Patrick Verkooijen, said that Rotterdam is threatened by rising sea levels and that the "completely self sufficient floating office is one of many examples of how we must adapt to the realities of climate change to ensure our infrastructure is not only resilient but future proof."
Dirk Jan Schaap, a real-estate developer at RED, said the company is currently building the floating concrete base off-site. Once it is on the water, contractors will build the office on the platform as if it is a plot of land. Completion is expected for October. Mr. Schaap said RED has a permit to keep the office at its planned site for at least 10 years. After that, the building could float on to a different spot.
Technology isn't an issue. Giant oil rigs prove that floating buildings can behundreds of feet tall and stable enough to withstand storms and avoid seasickness, proponents of floating real estate say.
But the lack of regulations has been an obstacle. Many cities don't have clear guidelines for waterborne properties, making builders vulnerable to potential fines and lawsuits. Money is another concern. It is still unclear how investors will value these properties.
While floating hotels and offices are still rare, floating homes are already fairly common in the Netherlands, a country with a long history of reclaiming land from the ocean. The Seattle area also has numerous houseboats. Nicolas Derouin is trying to bring the model to Miami. Last year, his company Arkup unveiled a 4,300-square-foot floating house that he claims can withstand category-four hurricanes.
When a storm nears, it can retreat to shallow waters, plant four steel rods into the ground and lift itself above the waves via hydraulic mechanism. The house, dubbed livable yacht, is on the market for $4.5 million. Mr. Derouin said he hopes that once cities settle on laws and property-tax rules for floating homes, buyers will have an easier time getting financing. Eventually he wants to branch out to floating resorts and floating communities.
Some hope the trend ultimately will lead to floating cities. The Seasteading Institute advocates for communities in international waters as "startup societies" that can make up their own rules. It was founded by investor Peter Thiel and Patri Friedman, the grandson of Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman.
Blue Frontiers, a company co-founded by members of the institute, started working on a floating island in French Polynesia in 2016. But in 2018, an election stirred up acrimony against the project, said the institute's president, Joe Quirk. Now, he said, the floating island is "stalled indefinitely" and the institute is looking for a new place to host its seasteads.

Turkey, Russia Hold
New Truce Talks
Turkey dispatched a delegation to Moscow for a new round of cease-fire talks in Syria, where relief agencies warn conflict could cause the worst humanitarian disaster in the nine-year conflict.
At stake is control of Idlib province, the last stronghold of Turkish-backed rebels resisting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which is backed by Russia.
Short of a truce and retreat of the Syrian army before the end of February, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened a full-blown attack on Mr. Assad's forces.
In recent weeks, Ankara deployed more than 10,000 troops with more than 2,000 pieces of artillery, tanks and armored vehicles into Idlib, according to Turkish media reports, raising concern in Washington and other Western capitals that the region was nearing the precipice of direct military confrontation between Turkey and Russia.
The two countries agreed in September 2018 to halt fighting in the northwestern province bordering Turkey, leading scores of civilians fleeing war elsewhere in Syria to seek refuge in Idlib.
But backed by Russian aircraft, Mr. Assad's troops resumed an offensive to reclaim Idlib territory two and half months ago, leaving 3.5 million people trapped in what relief workers say has effectively become the world's largest refugee camp.
Shelling and airstrikes sent some 900,000 people, most of them women and children, on the road in recent weeks, according to the United Nations.
Turkey's Foreign Ministry said its delegation met with Russian officials Monday, and talks would continue Tuesday.
Over the weekend, President Trump spoke about the situation in Idlib with Mr. Erdogan. He thanked him for Turkey's efforts to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, according to the White House, but stopped short of committing U.S. military support in a showdown with Russia.

ISRAEL
Hamas Said to Target
Troops in Cyberattack
The Israeli military said the Palestinian militant group Hamas targeted its soldiers in a monthslong operation that duped them into downloading spyware with the promise of exchanging illicit photos with young women.
Dozens of soldiers downloaded the spyware, but the scheme was detected early enough to prevent important secrets getting out and the Hamas servers hosting the operation were destroyed, the military said Sunday.
Using profiles purporting to be Israeli women, Hamas operatives contacted Israeli soldiers through Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and, for the first time, the messaging app Telegram.
The operatives promised to share photos with soldiers by offering them a link to download an app. After soldiers clicked on the link, Hamas could access files, text messages, camera and GPS information, and send the data to Hamas's servers, the Israeli military said.

IRAN
Rouhani Says Tehran
Won't Talk With U.S.
Iran will refuse to negotiate with the U.S. as long as Washington maintains its campaign of "maximum pressure" -- even if President Trump is re-elected, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said.
Mr. Rouhani's remarks solidify Iran's hard line in a face-off with the U.S. that weeks ago brought Washington and Tehran to the brink of war.
"It makes no difference who will be the next [American] administration," Mr. Rouhani said. "Iran will never negotiate under pressure."
He demanded the U.S. return to the 2015 nuclear deal, which President Trump quit in 2018, citing Iran's military activity in the Middle East.
The Iranian president, who has been isolated domestically amid the nuclear deal's near-collapse and the economic damage of U.S. sanctions, said he still had the support of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

ANGOLA
Pompeo Supports
Anticorruption Steps
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed support for the anticorruption stance and business-oriented agenda of Angolan President Joao Lourenco, following a meeting on Monday.
The Lourenco government's anticorruption push has involved the ouster of officials from the government of his predecessor, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and investigation of several of Mr. dos Santos's relatives for possible self-dealing.
In remarks to U.S. and Angolan business leaders, Mr. Pompeo offered a rebuke of government corruption around the world.
"Corruption is the enemy of nations' growth and progress," he told the group. "Here in Angola, damage from corruption is pretty clear."
Of his conversation with Mr. Lourenco, he said, "I was unabashed talking about the work that he's done, the work that needs to continue to be done."

UNITED KINGDOM
Storms Cause Severe
Floods, Leave 3 Dead
Britain issued severe flood warnings, advising of life-threatening danger after Storm Dennis dumped weeks' worth of rain in some places. A woman was found dead after being swept away by the floodwaters, the storm's third confirmed victim.
To the east, Dennis' gale-force winds also left nine people injured in Germany as their vehicles crashed into broken trees littering roads and train tracks. Flooding and power outages were reported elsewhere in Northern Europe.
By Monday evening, Britain's Environment Agency issued seven severe flood warnings in the central English counties of Herefordshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire. Another 200 lower-level flood warnings were also in place, meaning that flooding was expected.
Some 480 flood warnings and alerts were issued across England on Monday, the highest number on record, the agency said.
The storm's confirmed death toll rose to three as West Mercia Police said a body had been found in the search for a 55-year-old woman who had been missing near Tenbury in Worcestershire since Sunday.
The weather system brought winds of more than 90 miles an hour and up to 6 inches of rain to Britain over the weekend. More bad weather is forecast.
Forecasters said river levels in parts of northern England had yet to reach their peak. In the northern city of York, authorities were piling up more than 4,000 sandbags as the Rover Ouse continued to rise. It is expected to peak on Tuesday.
Other residents in Wales and western England were cleaning up Monday after the storm flooded roads, railways, homes and businesses and disrupted travel across Britain. Some told stories of fleeing for their lives.
Britain's environment secretary said climate change was making extreme weather events more common. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government denied it was unprepared for such storms.

BURKINA FASO
Gunmen Kill 24
In Attack Near Church
Gunmen killed 24 civilians, including a church pastor, and kidnapped three others in Burkina Faso, an official said.
The mayor of Boundore commune, Sihanri Osangola Brigadie, said the attack occurred in the town of Pansi in Yagha province. The roughly 20 attackers separated men from women close to a Protestant church. At least 18 other people were injured.
The gunmen looted oil and rice from shops and forced the three youths they kidnapped to help transport it on their motorbikes, he said.
Both Christians and Muslims were killed before the church was set on fire, said a government security official in the town of Dori, 110 miles from the attack.
Attacks have targeted religious leaders in the past. Last week, also in Yagha province, a retired pastor was killed and another pastor was abducted by gunmen, according to an internal security report for aid workers.

Full text: Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon thinks climate change is an urgent problem, but he is also making a case to keep using one of his state's biggest resources: coal.
Wyoming produces nearly half the coal burned by U.S. power plants. As coal use nationally has fallen because of low natural-gas prices, revenue from coal in Wyoming has plummeted. Coal severance taxes, one source of revenue, fell by more than 25% over the past decade to $194 million last year, according to the state Department of Revenue.
Mr. Gordon, a Republican, is urging the GOP-controlled state Legislature, which opened its session Monday, to adopt a raft of measures to support coal. He wants to spend $1 million to market it more effectively and $25 million to fund the development of technology to cut carbon emissions from coal to zero.
"I have seen glaciers receding," Mr. Gordon said of climate change in an interview. "I would say there's an emergency and an absolute need to address it quickly. We can do it better with coal."
The governor faces an uphill battle because most Wyoming coal is used in states where the retirement of coal-fired power plants shows no signs of slowing. Natural gas, solar and wind account for a growing share of the nation's electricity.
This year, utilities are expected to burn 490 million tons of coal, less than half the record 1.04 billion tons consumed in 2007, according to IHS Markit. Coal exports are expected to fall to 78 million tons this year, down from 116 million tons two years ago.
As Trump administration policies have struggled to halt coal's decline, the industry has turned to states for help. Last month, the West Virginia Coal Association asked state lawmakers to do everything "humanly possible" to help the industry.
"The whole focus here is to keep the plants and mines operating," said Chris Hamilton, senior vice president of the association, who made the request.
Last year, West Virginia lawmakers cut severance taxes paid by coal companies and offered a new tax incentive for companies that open or expand coal mines. A bill this year would require utilities to maintain their coal use in West Virginia and give the state a chance to intervene ahead of a closure.
In Indiana, a similar bill would require utilities to provide notice before shutting a coal plant and obtain approval from the state utility commission. Ohio lawmakers provided subsidies to two coal plants this fall, including one located in Indiana.
A Wyoming law enacted last year requires public utilities to try to sell a coal-fired power plant before shutting it.
Yet many states are moving in the opposite direction by embracing renewables and the shift away from coal.
In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, ordered the state in October to develop a plan to join nine states in New England and the mid-Atlantic region that are capping carbon emissions. Republican state lawmakers have said they would try to block the move through legislation or a lawsuit.
In Wyoming, Mr. Gordon, a rancher who describes himself as an environmentalist, said he wants the state and the University of Wyoming to develop new ways to use coal that don't put carbon into the atmosphere. He said that he supports wind and solar energy but that abandoning coal is shortsighted because renewables and other fuels won't be able to meet energy needs over the next several decades.
John Walke, clean-air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the environmental-advocacy group would evaluate any technology that eliminated carbon emissions from coal. But absent that, he said, "There's not going to be a role for coal in a world facing a climate crisis."

Full text: Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos says he is committing $10 billion to start a new fund to fight climate change, the biggest philanthropic move to date for the world's richest man.
Mr. Bezos, who announced the new fund on his Instagram account on Monday, said the Bezos Earth Fund would help back scientists, activists, nongovernment organizations and any other effort that "offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world." He said he would start issuing grants this summer.
"Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet," Mr. Bezos wrote. "I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share." A spokesman for Amazon confirmed the pledge is genuine but declined to provide additional details on Mr. Bezos' plans.
If he does set up a foundation, it would instantly become one of the largest in the U.S., as well as one of the most substantial financial commitments to combat climate change.
Climate change has become a major focus of many of the largest U.S. philanthropic foundations and a central issue for Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder whose Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest philanthropic organization in the U.S. by assets.
Mr. Bezos is an investor and board member in Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a $1 billion fund co-chaired by Mr. Gates and the philanthropist John Arnold. The fund aims to invest in promising experimental energy technologies.
Mr. Bezos' other major personal philanthropic arm is his Bezos Day One Fund, which launched in 2018 with a commitment of $2 billion toward funding nonprofits that aid homeless families and creating nonprofit preschools in low-income communities.

Full text: Soon after he was hired to run Nike Inc., John Donahoe took a trip to China. The technology veteran says he wanted to better understand how consumers there, one of Nike's biggest markets, view the brand.
It's part of a 100-day global listening tour that the former eBay Inc. boss has embarked on since he took over last month, just the third CEO since co-founder Phil Knight handed over the top job.
Mr. Donahoe inherits a $40 billion revenue business where profits and growth have been strong. Its roster of athletes features Serena Williams, LeBron James and Tiger Woods. Nike has shifted to selling more products directly to consumers, building its own apps and expanding overseas. The stock jumped nearly 40% last year, pushing its market cap above $150 billion or more than double Adidas AG.
He also became heir to a company that ousted several executives in 2018 amid complaints raised by female employees, was caught in controversy for using former NFL star Colin Kaepernick in an advertisement and had to disband an elite running team after longtime Nike coach Alberto Salazar was suspended.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the 59-year-old talked about his priorities, his management style and social issues:
WSJ: You were on the Nike board for years, but what have you learned in your first weeks as CEO?
A: I spent my first week in Asia. I started in China -- was in Shanghai and Beijing, then in Tokyo, because I wanted to experience Nike through the eyes of the consumer. I've spent a lot of time with our design and product teams and innovation teams just understanding the incredible investment and commitment to innovation in product.
WSJ: What are your priorities right now and what is your long-term strategy for Nike?
A: I've told the company that I have two priorities. No. 1: Don't screw it up. It's working, so keep focused on doing what we're doing. And then No. 2. I'm starting off by doing a lot of listening and a lot of learning.
I'm on a 100-day listening and learning tour.
I'm doing deep dives with product teams, marketing teams, innovation teams, design teams. Out of that, we will shape some priorities, but the direction is working. So, we need refinement, not significant adjustment.
WSJ: Can you discuss your management style?
A: I use the term servant leadership, which is the form of leadership that I've always espoused. How do you serve your purpose? How do you serve your customer? How do you serve your teammates? How do you serve the communities in which we operate?
One of my early role models as a leader was [former NBA coach] Phil Jackson. It's funny I've used sports analogies my whole career because Phil Jackson or [Duke] Coach K [Mike Krzyzewski] are the sort of leaders I respect the most. They got people to play together, perform at very high levels. I try to bring some of the same mind-set to each leadership role I have.
WSJ: Nike took a risk when it ran the Colin Kaepernick ad after his NFL protests. How will you decide when to weigh in and which social issues to support?
A: As you said, this is an issue that's facing every CEO in the world right now. The simple mind-set I would have is to be guided by what is good for our consumer, good for our athletes, good for our company. We will always lead with the athlete's voice.
Let me give an example: sustainability. Sustainability is important to athletes because global climate change is impacting sport.
For instance, the Tokyo Olympics are going to be the warmest Olympics on record thus far. They've already had to move the marathon out of Tokyo up to Sapporo. Our athletes care about that and some of the innovation around sustainability.
WSJ: Are there any particular issues that you wouldn't speak out on?
A: Things that aren't core to the company's focus. Everyone is welcome to have their opinions on a variety of issues, including employees, consumers and others. But our job is to help make our mission come to life: making sport a daily habit.
WSJ: Like many companies, women employees and athletes have raised concerns about culture at Nike. What has Nike done to address those concerns, and is there more you will do going forward? Will Nike continue to support Alberto Salazar?
A: Nike is always focused on women athletes, and we're increasing our investment in women athletes. I'll continue to do that, make that an important priority. Building a diverse, inclusive culture and team, that's the way you sustain great innovation.
The data is clear. The most diverse teams are also the most innovative teams. Nike has made very good progress on this and I'll give it personal time and attention. It's too soon for me to comment on [Alberto Salazar].
WSJ: Will there be any changes in the way you approach athlete endorsements? Types of sports or gender mix?
A: Nike has a comprehensive and sophisticated approach to identifying athletes, and teams all over the world to partner with. I'm struck by the global nature of it. I was in China earlier this month, and the number of Chinese athletes and Chinese sports federations, and the work with the Chinese government at the grass-roots level to promote sport. It's not just the elite athlete. It's also the PE teacher in a rural village in China.
WSJ: Your prior experience is running tech companies, not in retail or sportswear. How does that translate to Nike?
A: I bring a pretty simple mind-set. It is to see things through the eyes of the consumer.
When you're buying something, you aren't thinking digital or physical. You're thinking, I want to get what I want, where I want it, how I want it. Increasingly, that's a blended digital and physical experience. I believe that experience is the future.
The winning companies of the future will bring immersive, blended, digital and physical experiences. The good news is, Nike has enormous assets -- the Nike mobile app, Nike.com.
Nike has got a strong physical footprint of both owned stores, like the House of Innovation, as well as stores through our partners.

Alleged Spy Death
Sentence Is Upheld
Iran's top court upheld a death sentence for an Iranian citizen accused of providing the U.S. with details about the Iranian nuclear program at the root of tensions between Tehran and the Trump administration.
Amir Rahimpour received "big payments" for spying for the Central Intelligence Agency, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili as saying Tuesday. "God willing, he will see his punishment soon," he said.
Mr. Esmaili didn't offer any supporting evidence for the allegations against Mr. Rahimpour. The U.S. didn't comment on the announcement.
Iran has arrested and executed scores of people who it said were spying for foreign powers. It detained 17 Iranians in July on charges of spying for the U.S., drawing a rebuke from President Trump who dismissed the allegations as "totally false."
It wasn't immediately clear whether Mr. Rahimpour was among those arrested then.

SOUTH AFRICA
Warrant Issued for
Ex-President's Arrest
A judge in South Africa issued an arrest warrant for former President Jacob Zuma for failing to appear in court on a corruption case he has sought to avoid for months -- now by saying he is ill.
The National Prosecuting Authority requested the warrant, the South African Broadcasting Corp. reported. It doesn't come into effect until the case resumes on May 6.
Reports have said Mr. Zuma is in Cuba for treatment. The NPA requested his medical records as evidence of his claim, the state broadcaster reported. Mr. Zuma's legal team asserted he had two operations in January before going abroad. The judge questioned a letter from a military hospital in Pretoria, explaining his absence, noting it had no date.
Mr. Zuma is accused of receiving bribes from French arms manufacturer Thales. Mr. Zuma denies the charges.
Alleged corruption is estimated to have cost South Africa billions of dollars. The economy, the most developed in sub-Saharan Africa, has continued to struggle to recover under Mr. Zuma's successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa.

UNITED KINGDOM
Plan for Fossil-Fuel
Vehicle Ban Sped Up
Britain said it plans to ban the sale of new gasoline and diesel fueled cars by 2035 -- five years earlier than its previous target -- in a bid to speed up efforts to tackle climate change.
The government has pledged to reduce its net greenhouse-gas emissions to zero by 2050. But its advisory Committee on Climate Change warned domestic action to slash carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming is lagging far behind what is needed.
The U.K.'s new 2035 target for ending gas and diesel sales is one of the world's more ambitious. Several countries including France plan to stop by 2040. Norway -- one of the most aggressive early adopters of electric cars -- has a goal, but not a requirement, to eliminate gasoline and diesel cars, excluding hybrids, by 2025.
Environmental groups said Britain's goal wasn't ambitious enough.
Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace U.K., said "phasing out the internal combustion engine faster is an important piece of the puzzle."
"However, pushing the date later than 2030 would vastly reduce the chances of meeting our climate targets, and the potential to deliver thousands of electric vehicle manufacturing jobs," she said.
The U.K. says it will ban fossil-fuel cars and vans even earlier than 2035 "if a faster transition is feasible." The ban will also include hybrid vehicles.

Full text: POMBAL, Brazil -- For the past 15 years, Carlos Pacheco has raised cattle in what was once virgin forest. When pastures went bad, he would simply cut deeper into the Amazon, one of millions of farmers who have helped strip away about a fifth of the world's greatest rainforest.
Because he expanded into land he doesn't own, he can't use it as collateral for a loan to buy equipment and fertilizer, nor can he tap the expertise of a government agronomist. That means he uses more land to raise each cow than do legal farmers in the breadbasket of southern Brazil.
It may sound counterintuitive, but Brazilian authorities think giving Mr. Pacheco a deed to the land he farms could curtail deforestation. If he becomes a more efficient farmer, able to produce more on less land, he might hesitate before walking away from depleted pastures and carving new ones. In short, it might discourage him and squatters like him from cutting ever deeper into the jungle.
"If this doesn't happen, we will continue to deforest," said the 49-year-old rancher, the leader of a tightknit group of several hundred settlers on the forest frontier.
The administration of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wants to see if he is right. In February, it plans to start handing out deeds to some 300,000 Amazon squatters, with a plan that might help but has raised a howl of disapproval for rewarding bad behavior.
Officials in Brazil's environment ministry think they can improve the well-being of Amazon settlers and curb deforestation and large fires, such as those last year.
"There's more than 20 million people who live in the Amazon and need to survive," said Ricardo Salles, Brazil's environment minister. "If the economic incentive is wrong, the result is wrong."
Defining which economic activity in the Amazon is legal, and where, could also help the state crack down on illegal logging and burning. If farms and ranches had legal boundaries and owners, authorities armed with satellite images could better pinpoint and police rainforest incursions, officials say.
Critics of the plan have plenty of doubts, both about the plan's merits and the government's ability to pull it off. One objection is the idea of rewarding squatters with deeds.
"Illegal land-grabbers and deforesters now have a reason to believe they will go unpunished," said Mauricio Voivodic, who runs Brazil's affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund.
Others doubt the administration's commitment to enforcing environmental laws, not to mention its ability to police a region the size of the western U.S.
One issue is Mr. Bolsonaro himself, whom many environmental activists view as a careless steward. The president, who has jokingly called himself Captain Chainsaw, won election in part by promising to unshackle Brazil's economic potential, even in the Amazon.
He has often railed against environmentalists as agitators, and accused them last year of setting fires in the rainforest, without offering evidence.
The Brazilian Amazon is so vast that it helps regulate global temperatures by absorbing an estimated 5% of all carbon dioxide emissions. When large areas are destroyed, the negative climate effect is twofold -- not only are there fewer trees to absorb carbon from the air, but the trees that have been cut or burned release the carbon locked up in them. Carbon, in turn, raises global temperatures.
Much of the worst destruction occurred from the 1980s to the early 2000s. A swath of the Amazon nearly the size of Spain now is dedicated to crop fields and pastures. In the 12 months through last July, the Amazon lost an additional 3,800 square miles, an area bigger than Delaware, according to satellite-image analysis at Brazil's National Space Research Agency.
That was 30% more than lost in the prior 12 months and the highest deforestation level since 2008, the agency's data showed.
Mr. Bolsonaro says he wants to protect the Amazon by giving its inhabitants the ability to make a living without further large-scale deforestation. Responding to last year's outcry over fires, the president in January created an army task force to help environmental protection agents battle deforestation.
Researchers and policy makers who study the Amazon say an approach that brings legality to an outlaw region -- with its untitled land and endemic corruption -- is the only solution to the sometimes-contradictory goals of controlling deforestation and reducing poverty.
Across three Amazon states, wildcat farmers, ranchers and loggers who are relentlessly exploiting what was once jungle said that unless given alternatives, they were determined to continue their illegal activities, which carry few repercussions.
"Settlers are the people who deforest the most because they have no alternative," said Minervina Silva, a mayor and longtime farmer in the Amazon. "Deforesting is easier when you are doing so clandestinely. Once you're legalized, you stop doing stupid things."
Elsewhere in Brazil, farms initially cut from the wilderness grew to be efficient producers that turned the country from food importer to a leading exporter of meat and grains. In areas where issues of land ownership have been resolved, many farmers have increased production without expanding deeper into the forest, thanks largely to technology, access to capital and state assistance. That shows how intensive agriculture could help slow deforestation in the Amazon, said Dan Nepstad, president of the Earth Innovation Institute, a nonprofit that supports sustainable activity.
He said modern land-use techniques such as feedlots, rotating pastures and fertilizing them permit raising cattle herds on fewer acres. Meanwhile, farmers with access to loans might plant profitable new crops, such as cacao, on some former pastureland.
In Brazil as a whole, cattle numbers are up roughly 32% since 1998, while land devoted to pasture has fallen around 13%, according to the Brazilian Association of Meat Exporting Industries.
Deeper in the Amazon, these trends are less pronounced but very much a reality. "You have had intensification of beef and soy in the Amazon at the same time that deforestation has declined pretty sharply from where it was years ago, even with the recent uptick," said David Cleary, director of global agriculture for the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit focused on fighting climate change.
The question remains how long might it take Brazil to end predatory farming and the damage that scientists say is pushing the Amazon closer to a point where it is unable to replenish lost forest. The federal government cut funding for the environment ministry by more than 24% last year as part of a fiscal tightening.
Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina, who is overseeing the process of legalizing land ownership, said Brazil needs to both improve the policing of illegal deforestation and provide deeds and credit to Amazon settlers.
"These people are out there. Am I supposed to move them somewhere else, so they can deforest again?" she said. "Environmental protection must go hand-in-hand with economic development because prosperity, I think, leads to forest preservation."
Though it might seem impossible to sell land without a deed, Amazon settlers make deals that transfer property. Those who have cut trees to produce a pasture or crop field often use it for just a few years and then, when its unfertilized soil has lost nutrients, abandon it or sell it cheap in an informal deal.
Most farmers in the Amazon are poor. Only 15% are in the middle class or above, said Katia Abreu, a former agriculture minister, based on research she did at the ministry.
Even some of the largest Amazon farmers and ranchers have illegal land. Over the decades, 73-year-old cattleman Joao Bueno cut into the forest in Para state to build a network of ranches totaling 45,000 acres, with 28,000 head of cattle.
He has a special document that allows him to produce and sell cattle to a slaughterhouse, but it isn't a title, so it doesn't allow him to use the land as loan collateral. Mr. Bueno said tapping credit would permit him to modernize his operation with fertilizer and techniques common elsewhere, raising three times as many head of cattle on the same acreage.
"Land without documentation is nobody's land, so people take advantage of it to clear forest for pastures," Mr. Bueno said.
The immensity of the task of bringing order in the Amazon is evident in remote outposts such as Jonas Lopes de Souza's farm.
Sinewy, with leathery hands and a weather-beaten face, Mr. de Souza, 43, said his goal is putting food on the table for his wife and three children. He grows cacao and raises cattle on a once-forested plot the size of 55 football fields, about 75 acres.
He readily acknowledged, as he walked in worn-out flip-flops through a pasture, that he would cut and burn his way into the brush and trees when he needs fresh land to plant cacao.
"I slash with the scythe, then comes the big red," Mr. de Souza said with a grin, referring to the fires he sets in the dry season to burn the downed vegetation. "I can't make money keeping the forest."
Para, an Amazon state three times the size of California, is pocked with the small farms of settlers like Mr. de Souza who arrived with the hope of a better life.
Years ago, it was large outfits that fueled much of the deforestation. Now, small settlers are to blame, said Daniel Silva, who leads a team at the Brazilian space agency that analyzes satellite images to spot deforestation.
On the computer screen in his office, he pointed to red dots on an outline of the Amazon. "The smaller those areas, the hardest for us" to pinpoint damage, he said.
Until the deed program, the task of changing settlers' behavior fell mostly to outgunned agents such as Denilson Ferreira of Ideflor-bio, a state agency that promotes sustainable development. His job is teaching farmers how to make better use of land, in the hope they can be productive without cutting deeper into the forest.
The lack of legal ownership complicates his work. "We don't even know for sure how many people live in this region," Mr. Ferreira said.
Meanwhile, employees of the federal environmental protection agency, Ibama, say they have too few resources to go after illegal loggers and corrupt officials who sell fake land titles.
Recently, at the dry-season peak when felled trees are burned, only three Ibama agents were operating in Sao Felix do Xingu, a county the size of South Carolina.
When Ibama found out about a major lumber-smuggling operation, its agents couldn't respond because all three had been deployed to guard several hundred head of cattle seized at an illegal farm. An army unit assigned to help protect Ibama agents when they go on risky operations was left cooling its heels, the soldiers kicking a soccer ball around.
"The state is absent here," said Major Afonso Neto, who was leading the army operation. "People here learn from childhood to slash and burn."

Full text: DAVOS, Switzerland -- Blackstone Group Inc. Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said it is clear that the climate is changing, and businesses need to take action.
"You can't watch the news literally anywhere without seeing giant fires and storms happening on a regular basis," Mr. Schwarzman said at a Wall Street Journal event at the World Economic Forum. "There's little doubt that something very profound appears to be going on, and it ought to be addressed."
Climate change is a hot topic at this year's Alpine gathering of world leaders, executives and activists.
In a speech Tuesday, teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg lambasted politicians, saying they aren't doing enough to address climate change.
Shortly before she spoke, President Trump called on the Davos audience to "reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse."
Mr. Schwarzman said the private-equity company he co-founded 35 years ago is looking across its portfolio of companies to improve sustainability. It is also an item on the checklist the firm runs on each deal it considers.
"Ironically, it ends up being good economics," Mr. Schwarzman said.

Full text: The world experienced near-record global temperatures in 2019, federal climate scientists said. The year capped what the scientists said was the warmest decadein modern times.
In an annual climate report, scientists at National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which independently track world temperatures, each ranked last year as the second-warmest since systematic record-keeping began in 1880.
"The decade that just ended is clearly the warmest decade on record," said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. "Every decade since the 1960s clearly has been warmer than the one before."
During 2019, the average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.8 degree Fahrenheit (0.98 degree Celsius) above the 20th-century mean, with 95% certainty, according to the NASA calculations. The NOAA scientists calculated the average global temperature as 1.71 degrees F (0.95 degree C) above the average for 1901 to 2000. Each agency uses slightly different data sets and techniques to arrive at their results.
Their calculations are in line with a recent assessment by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, operated by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, which last week ranked 2019 as the second-warmest year on record.
All told, 10 of the warmest years in their records occurred in the past decade, the NOAA and NASA scientists said.
Since the 1880s, the average global surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees F (1 degree C), according to scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute.
Much scientific work attributes rising temperatures to greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide from fossil fuel emissions, agriculture and cement production, and land use changes, though some question the connections. Satellite studies of solar energy output since 1978 show the sun doesn't appear to be responsible for the warming trend observed over the past several decades, NASA scientists have reported.
Atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels increased in 2019, reaching a seasonal peak of 414.7 parts per million (ppm) at NOAA's Mauna Loa Atmospheric Baseline Observatory. It was the seventh consecutive year of global increases in concentrations of carbon dioxide, according to data published by NOAA and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
The warmest year to date was 2016, when an unusually strong El Nino current in the Pacific Ocean boosted warming world-wide by influencing the formation of high- and low-pressure weather systems, trade winds and rainfall. In 2019, a relatively weak El Nino subsided early, the NASA and NOAA scientists said. Ocean heat during 2019 was the highest on record, NOAA scientists said.
Weather dynamics often affect regional temperatures differently, so not every area on Earth experienced the same temperatures last year.
In 2019, Europe recorded its warmest calendar year, experiencing two of the most intense heat waves in its modern history in June and July, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which provides climate analytics to EU member countries. Paris registered a high temperature of 108.7 degrees F (42.6 C) in July, breaking a 72-year-old record by 4 degrees F.
For the entire U.S., NOAA scientists found the annual mean temperature for 2019 was the third-warmest on record.
Alaska experienced destructive wildfires that, with those in California, caused damages in excess of $1 billion, NOAA scientists said. In all, NOAA counted 14 weather-related billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. last year.

Full text: BlackRock Inc. said it would take a tougher stance against corporations that aren't providing a full accounting of environmental risks, part of moves by the investment giant to show it is doing more to address investment challenges posed by climate change.
Among the moves, BlackRock said it would be increasingly disposed to vote against management and boards if companies don't disclose climate change risks and plans in line with key industry standards.
BlackRock is also pulling back from thermal coal producers in actively managed debt-and-equity portfolios by mid-2020, a move that will lead to $500 million in sales. It will expand the range of sustainable investment products as well as double to 150 the number of exchange-traded funds that address environmental, social and governance challenges.
BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with about $7 trillion under management. It has risen on the back of index funds that trade on exchanges and through these funds has extended its reach across nearly every company and is part of the retirement accounts of millions of people world-wide. It also sits at the backbone of Wall Street as its software is used by banks to monitor their risks.
The firm said it is putting the focus on sustainability because the costs of climate change have ramifications on the price of assets and the financial ecosystem.
"Climate change has become a defining factor in companies' long-term prospects," BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink said in his annual letter. "The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance."
The letter is a reflection of Mr. Fink's towering influence over companies. But it has rankled some rivals who have sometimes grumbled about what they consider to be a moralistic tone.
The rise of index funds transformed three firms into major forces among American corporations and thrust them into the public spotlight. The biggest -- BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. -- hold roughly a fifth of the S&P 500 through funds they run for investors. They can cast critical votes and have the ears of chief executives. How they exercise this power -- or choose not to -- has ripple effects across markets.
All three have faced questions over their responsibilities as shareholders on behalf of investors in funds they run. In years past, these firms have targeted gender diversity in boardrooms among other issues. Lately, there has been increased pressure on them to do more on climate change.
BlackRock's offices around the world have been frequented by activists who blast the firm for being slow to act on green issues. The firm has debated a question internally: How can BlackRock ensure it has public support to operate in the countries where it does business as it continues to grow?
The firm said it would provide more information on data on the carbon footprint and other potentially controversial holdings in its mutual funds. It also said it would disclose more details of its conversations with the companies its funds invest in. BlackRock also recently said it had joined Climate Action 100+, the world's largest group of investors by assets pressuring companies to act on climate change.
The moves come as regulators are scrutinizing funds with environmental and social aims, in an effort to determine whether the claims by various asset managers are at odds with reality.
It is a hot corner in the investment management world. Funds focused on sustainability attracted a surge in interest in the past year. U.S. open-ended funds and exchange-traded funds focused on those strategies took in over $20 billion in net flows in 2019, nearly four times more than in the previous year, according to Morningstar Inc.
BlackRock has its eyes on a bigger presence in that market. That could help it win over younger investors and millennials who want to invest money in line with personal values. The firm wants to increase assets it manages in so-called sustainable strategies to more than $1 trillion from $90 billion today.

Full text: TUMBARUMBA, Australia -- Neil Hamilton spent New Year's Eve shooting his sheep in the head.
He had begun the morning sipping coffee and eating smoked salmon with guests, when flames erupted from a forested ridge outside his farmhouse in this rainy highlands town midway between Sydney and Melbourne.
Within half an hour, a gale was raging outside. As flames approached, Mr. Hamilton, 59, grabbed a hose attached to a pump on his tractor and sprayed water at the approaching flames.
"It got to the stage that if we stayed outside we would have died," he said.
The fire blew past Mr. Hamilton's home, leaving it undamaged, but he emerged to a changed farm. His orchard, with its quince, nectarine and apricot trees, was a smoldering ruin. Most of his 200 sheep had been reduced to charred lumps.
Around 50 stood around silently, their legs blackened and injured from the fire. Mr. Hamilton took his .22-caliber rifle, and went from one to the next, putting them out of their misery.
Fires have ravaged Australia in recent weeks, burning an area roughly 10 times the size burned in California's historic 2018 wildfire season. The flames have spread with stunning speed, cutting off roads in and out of towns and flushing coastal residents to beaches where they were rescued by sea.
Thousands of homes have burned and more than 25 people have died, with blazes expected to keep burning through Australia's summer into February, if not longer.
Beach towns, ski resorts, and dairy farms have fallen to fires that have eaten more than 26,000 square miles of land -- an area larger than West Virginia. Some experts have said the fires could shave as much as 0.4% off economic growth, mainly in the current quarter, and insurance losses are already estimated at around $686 million, based just on claims made so far, according to the Insurance Council of Australia on Friday. That total is sure to rise as more than 100 fires raged Sunday in New South Wales, the southeastern part of the continent, which has borne the brunt of the disaster.
Around Tumbarumba, dozens of houses and farm buildings have been destroyed. Commercial pine forests, which can take two decades to grow, have gone up in flames. Blueberry fields have been torched, along with vineyards and hazelnut groves.
A dry continent, Australia has a history of wildfires. But this year's fires are different. They started earlier in the season and have spread to places, such as Tumbarumba, that rarely had intense fires in the past.
"We've never seen the length of fires that have been occurring, the scale across the areas and intensity of the fires," said Mathew Crowther, a professor in the school of life and environmental sciences at the University of Sydney.
Australia has become steadily hotter over the past century, with most warming happening since 1950, according to the country's Bureau of Meteorology. Last year was the warmest since records began in 1910, exacerbating a drought in eastern states and creating conditions for bush fires. Tumbarumba, in New South Wales state, got around 40% less rain than in a typical December.
The damage is worsened by decisions that put more people at risk. Rising inner-city home prices push Australians into distant suburbs brushing up against the forest.
The population of Sydney -- ringed by the ocean and national parks -- has risen rapidly in recent years and is projected by government statisticians to expand by up to 25% in the decade through mid-2027. Even faster growth is forecast for Melbourne, which could become Australia's biggest city. Both cities have experienced smoky conditions from the fires.
Younger Australians, like American millennials, are increasingly moving from pricey urban centers to less-dense parts of the country, a trend business analysts refer to as "tree-change." Places like Yanchep, 35 miles from Perth in Western Australia, saw its population double from 2011 to 2016, putting the town of around 10,000 under threat from fires that tore through Yanchep National Park in December.
The population shifts have strained firefighting resources.Some experts say rural Australia needs more dedicated firefighters.
"The heavy lifting is being done by volunteers," said Dale Dominey-Howes, a geographer and disaster-risk-management expert at the University of Sydney. "As Australia's climate destabilizes, we need a larger standing workforce that deals with natural disasters."
Australians and their leaders are questioning whether their way of life must change.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said an inquiry will happen once the emergency response ends, looking at everything from hazard reduction to building codes in rural areas. He has set up a $1.4 billion recovery fund and mobilized 3,000 defense-force reservists to provide immediate help, including dropping animal feed to farmers from helicopters, and to begin the lengthy rebuild.
Mr. Morrison's climate policy has been criticized by environmentalists and political opponents for favoring coal-mining interests over efforts to limit emissions. He has said his government aims to bring Australia's emissions down, but without harming economic growth or driving up the cost of electricity. Australia is responsible for around 1.3% of global emissions, according to the Australian Department for the Environment and Energy. China and the U.S. are the world's top two polluters, together accounting for around 40% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2018, according to research group Global Climate Atlas.
Australia has long used prescribed burning -- fires deliberately lit by authorities in benign weather to rid the forest floor of dry twigs and other fuel -- to reduce the risk of bush fires. More than 1,000 controlled burns were carried out in the past five years to clear more than 1.5 million acres of dead vegetation.
Dry conditions have made the measures harder, because prescribed burns can be more difficult to control, narrowing the window for action, while recent hot and windy weather limits the tactic's effectiveness.
Officials also have had to contend with arson, with two dozen people already charged by New South Wales police with deliberately starting bush fires this season.
The sentiment that rural communities lack proper protection is shared in Tumbarumba, which has a small permanent firefighting team of two trucks and a crew of 10, backed by volunteers.
Robyn Jones, the proprietor of the Tumbarumba Motel, which has housed 60 firefighters during the crisis, said the government severely underinvested in fire response. She said more aircraft should have been available to drop water and spray retardant sooner, and that the state hadn't employed enough workers to maintain the forest. "We just had nothing to stop the fire," she said.
A town of about 1,850 people about 300 miles southwest of Sydney by road, Tumbarumba has been around since the 1800s. More recently, it bet big on forestry, with pine plantations and one of the Southern Hemisphere's largest softwood mills nearby. It has an antiques shop, artists' studio and a single gas station.
Fires have only occasionally been a problem, because Tumbarumba has plentiful rainfall and a temperate climate -- perfect for growing blueberries and grapes for wine.
Mr. Hamilton, the sheep farmer, moved there 2 1/2 years ago after stints in Canberra and Norway, where he worked overseeing climate change research for a nongovernment organization. He and his wife, Grazyna, 61, began building a modernist home to retire in with large windows overlooking pastures.
As fires spread around Australia in December, locals began getting worried. Then, on Dec. 28, lightning struck north of the area, sparking flames.
At the urging of community leaders, most residents peeled away to safer towns. A hard-core group of 200, including Mr. Hamilton, stayed behind to save what they could.
At 12:45 a.m. on New Year's Eve, residents with properties outside of Tumbarumba began getting text messages warning them flames were coming. At 8:15 a.m., Joerg Ernst, the 45-year-old captain of the town's fire and rescue service, got a message saying fire had broken out on Blue Dogs Lane, on the town's fringe.
Mr. Ernst had been working late the night before in a nearby town where winds whipped up by a pyro-convective column -- something like a fire tornado -- had overturned a 10-ton firetruck, killing a volunteer firefighter and injuring three others. This time, he and some colleagues rushed out so quickly that they didn't have time to put on face masks to protect themselves from smoke.
Blue Dogs Lane was ablaze. Mr. Ernst could also see the fire racing up a tree-lined gully toward other properties. The owner of one, clutching a hose, was staring it down with plans to retreat to the basement if defense proved hopeless. Mr. Ernst's truck discharged some water, bolstering the house's protection, before moving on.
Soon, though, an old community hall was completely on fire and the truck was low on water. One crew member needed oxygen after inhaling smoke and had to withdraw.
The flames were consuming other properties. Another crew member realized flames were approaching his own home on Hilltop Road, which he had been building for years. Mr. Ernst recalls his colleague responded stoically, recognizing it was already lost.
In the chaos, fire crews couldn't be sure where the fire front was, and where it was going next. By 2 p.m., the main blaze had veered away from town and was heading up a forested hill, threatening a communications tower.
Area residents took stock.Fires had damaged packing equipment and vehicles at the Costa berry farms, and torched vines at the family-owned Johansen winery.
Another resident, Adam Gatford, found that 20% of his property's 1,000 chestnut trees were blackened, wiping out any expected profit for the season. It will take seven years before their replacements produce a viable crop, the 46-year-old grower said.
Authorities canceled a New Year's Day rodeo, held since 1945. Without power to run his refrigerator, the owner of the historic Union Hotel bar gave his meat to fire crews rather than see it spoiled.
In the days that followed, residents knew the fire danger wasn't over. It was smoldering in forests behind Tumbarumba, susceptible to winds that could make it jump "the box," as local firefighters call active fire areas hemmed in by man-made breaks, like bulldozed earth.
On Jan. 4, authorities warned residents that a wind change would put Tumbarumba back in the line of the blaze. This time, residents got lucky: The inferno steered away from the town center.
Five days later, however, officials told a meeting hall packed with anxious residents that conditions were set to worsen again.
By early afternoon plumes of smoke appeared on Mt. Ikes, overlooking Tumbarumba, heralding the battle to come. Power supply, which had gone down during the New Year's Eve fires, had failed again. The sun was baking, and wind picked up straw off the ground. Patches of yellow grass began spontaneously smoking.
By Friday evening, flames were leaping over man-made breaks, and trees lit up.
An evacuation call went out: Residents in the southern and eastern parts of town were told to gather in an area called the Oval, which had a fire-resistant building near the rodeo grounds.
Others, like Mr. Hamilton, the sheep farmer, stayed in their homes, preparing to fight again.
"We have too much skin in the game" to leave, Mr. Hamilton said. His home isn't insured yet because one section is still under construction. He set his phone alarm each hour during the night, so he could scan the horizon for fires.
Then the wind shifted. By midnight, it pushed fires toward a neighboring town, and residents were told they could return to their homes. Exhausted firefighters, their orange fire suits stained with ash, went back to the Tumbarumba Motel for a few hours of sleep.
The constant threat of more fires was taking a mental toll.
It had taken more than a week for Lucy Henderson, 58, to work up the courage to visit the shell of her homestead several miles outside of Tumbarumba that she has lived in for more than a decade. The fires had reduced the house to a mess of black dust, metal and stone. Ms. Henderson sobbed in front of it.
Her next step would be sift through the wreckage to find her wedding ring. "I've already cried a river of tears over this," she said.
Fires continue to burn out of control in the area. Current advice from Australia's Rural Fire Service is that fires are burning toward Tumbarumba again.

Full text: Some New Yorkers did a double-take as cherry blossoms flowered in Central Park over the past few days, thanks to unusually mild weather.
Light-pink cherry blossoms are traditionally a sign of spring, when many cities hold festivals in their honor. But a stretch of unseasonably warm days recently has had some species of cherry trees strutting their stuff.
Temperatures hit a record 69 degrees in Central Park on Saturday and made it to 67 degrees Sunday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.
Admirers passing by a cherry tree budding next to the park's Great Lawn on Friday expressed a mix of delight and concern that it might be yet another reminder of climate change.
"This is gorgeous, but at the same time, is this a sign of the end of time?" asked Isa Julson, a lawyer walking with her 4-month-old baby strapped to her chest. She was accompanied by her brother, Jack Julson, who was visiting from St. Paul, Minn.
"This is a tropical vacation," he said. "I did want to see a snowy Central Park, but it's not going to happen."
A spokesman for the Central Park Conservancy said the Weeping Higan Cherry, now blooming in the park and elsewhere in the city, has flowered during warm spells in winter before, and shouldn't be harmed by doing so now.
Some scientists have been tracking the schedule of spring cherry tree blooms in Washington, D.C., and Kyoto, Japan, to see how a trend toward earlier flowering may be related to climate change.
In the area including New York City and Long Island, the average daytime high for January hit 40 degrees last year, after trending up about 2 degrees overall since 1895, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
In winter, "It's much more likely you'll have stretches of warm weather now than in the 1900s," said David Easterling, a climate scientist at the organization. Such warming is due to increasing greenhouse gases, he said, mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels.
The forecast highs for Central Park this weekend were about 25 degrees above normal, said Cynthia Rosenzweig, head of the Climate Impacts Group at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and former chair of the New York City Panel on Climate Change. She said that from Jan. 1 through Jan. 9, Central Park was running about 6 degrees above normal.
"It is startling even for scientists to see how rapidly the climate is changing," she said.
A spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden said one of its cherry species, known as the "ever blooming" tree, flowered in late December a few years ago during a warm stretch. In 2012, the botanic garden's arborist Christopher Roddick expressed concern about having some of its other cherry trees blooming two weeks ahead of expectations, in an article titled "A Budding Crisis?" He warned that some trees that bud early could be damaged if hit by frost, affecting their fruit yields, as well as the birds and insects that depend on their nectar.
As much as some New Yorkers were unsettled by the high temperatures, many celebrated a chance to enjoy it.
"This is glorious," said Sarah Stock, who was thrilled to get to Central Park with her 6-week-old daughter asleep in a stroller. "Long term it's not the best, but for the here and now, we're happy to be out of the house."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump proposed the first comprehensive overhaul of National Environmental Policy Act rules in more than 40 years, saying changes are needed to streamline approval of highways, energy pipelines and other infrastructure projects, as part of his administration's broader efforts to pare environmental regulations.
The proposal was hailed by business groups, energy companies and construction unions but criticized by environmentalists, who said it comes as mounting threats posed by climate change make thorough review of infrastructure projects more critical than ever.
Among the more than a dozen proposed changes to NEPA's environmental-permit rules, the government for the first time would set limits for completion of environmental reviews, which can sometimes take a decade or longer. Full environmental impact statements would need to be completed within two years, while less comprehensive environmental assessments would have to be concluded within one year.
"We want to build new roads, bridges, tunnels, highways bigger, better, faster," Mr. Trump said from the White House, joined by business and union leaders. "These endless delays waste money, keep projects from breaking ground and deny jobs to our nation's incredible workers."
The plan, which is subject to public hearings before it can be approved, faces likely court challenges from environmental groups and Democratic-led states. Some congressional Democrats said Thursday that the proposed rewrite was illegal. But leaders in both parties said the overhaul, if enacted, could mark the administration's most significant change to environmental regulation.
"Forcing federal agencies to ignore environmental threats is a disgraceful abdication of our responsibility to protect the planet for future generations," Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said this week, anticipating the overhaul plan. He called it a "gift to the fossil-fuel industry."
Mr. Hartl and other critics are concerned the overhaul is the latest in a series of Trump administration efforts to limit the government's ability to address climate change.
Recent U.S. government and United Nations reports have sounded increasingly urgent alarms, saying the world must sharply curb greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels to avoid the most catastrophic outcomes. Mr. Trump, a Republican, and his cabinet members have dismissed those warnings or said they don't have legal, effective ways to address them. They have instead moved to ease environmental regulations to help manufacturing and fossil-fuel development.
Industrial interests and building trade unions have said that NEPA, enacted in 1970, has become a tool of obstruction by environmental groups, which energy companies are fighting to build more pipeline capacity amid the recent boom in U.S. oil and gas production.
Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions, a labor group allied with energy and pipeline companies, praised the administration's NEPA proposal as a way to limit how long some of those disputes can last.
"We are fully supportive of the president's initiative," said Mr. McGarvey, who joined Mr. Trump at the White House Thursday.
Supporters welcomed the move as a long-awaited effort to cut red tape by an administration that has so far failed to deliver on big promises to jump-start infrastructure development. Business groups have said lengthy NEPA reviews are partly to blame for the nearly $1 trillion backlog of transportation projects alone.
"Our country is at a pivotal time for American energy," said Anne Bradbury, chief executive of the American Exploration & Production Council, a trade group for some of the country's largest independent oil-and-gas companies. "The administration's modernization of NEPA removes bureaucratic barriers that were stifling construction of key infrastructure projects needed for U.S. producers to deliver energy in a safe and environmentally protective way."
The National Association of Manufacturers "called for exactly this type of modernization," the trade group's leader, Jay Timmons, said. "Our efforts should be used for building the infrastructure Americans desperately need, not wasted on mountains of paperwork and endless delays."
Mr. Trump said it took more than two decades to finish reviews for a runway at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. He said that it took longer to start construction on a 2.8-mile bridge connection in North Carolina's Outer Banks.
"It took four years to build the Golden Gate Bridge, five years to build the Hoover Dam," Mr. Trump said, citing projects that predated by decades modern environmental standards, or research on the impacts of such projects.
Approval for Mr. Trump's changes isn't certain. Public hearings and review will take months, and many doubt the administration will have time to enact the changes before the Nov. 3 election.
Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, called the rewrite illegal, potentially foreshadowing the lawsuits that could further delay or block an overhaul. He said courts have ruled that NEPA requires consideration of climate change, and any move counter to that could invalidate the proposal.
The battle lines are likely to be drawn in the fine print of the overhaul's mechanics.
Part of the Trump administration's push is to limit the scope of what agencies have to consider, and Mr. Trump said federal duplication of local and state efforts often causes delays.
Some Democrats counter that reviews often drag on now because declines in the government workforce leave fewer people to handle more work. They said insufficient consideration of climate change will only cost taxpayers more in the long run, through higher insurance bills and shorter lifespans for new projects.
"This NEPA rewrite favors big polluters and corporate profits over balanced, science-based decision making," said Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top-ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee.

Firefighter Dies in
Residential Blaze
A Missouri firefighter died after falling through a floor while battling a house fire.
The fire was reported shortly after 11 a.m. Sunday in the laundry room of a home in Peculiar, Mo., which is about 30 miles south of Kansas City, Mo.
Grandview Fire Chief Ron Graham said the firefighter fell through the floor near the front door as firefighters entered the home. The firefighter was taken to a hospital where he died.
The family that lives in the home was able to escape before firefighters arrived.

CALIFORNIA
Climate Bond Mulled
For Disaster Plans
California lawmakers are set to weigh a $4.2 billion climate bond that would allow the state to borrow money to prepare for natural disasters.
The borrowing proposal, a holdover bill from last year, would have to pass at least one legislative chamber by the end of January to have a chance at becoming law.
Catastrophic wildfires have destroyed thousands of homes, generating billions of dollars in insurance claims and costing taxpayers billions more in cleanup costs. The bulk of the borrowing proposal would go toward reducing wildfire risk throughout the state. It also includes money to protect farmland from climate change, bolster the state's water sources and help coastal communities plan for sea-level rise.
The $4.2 billion price tag could grow as lawmakers discuss adding more projects for things like buying solar batteries and fuel cells to keep the lights on at nursing homes and other vulnerable sites when utility companies pre-emptively shut off electricity.

CONSERVATION
Counting Whales
From Space Pitched
An aquarium and an engineering firm in Massachusetts are partnering on a project to better protect whales by monitoring them from space.
New England Aquarium of Boston and Draper of Cambridge say whale conservation needs new, higher-tech solutions to protect whales from extinction. So, the pair is working together using data from sources such as satellites, sonar and radar to keep a closer eye on how many whales are in the ocean.
The effort, which the aquarium and firm are calling "Counting Whales From Space," involves gathering data from sources ranging from European space agencies to amateur radio operators to create a probability map of where in the ocean the whales might be, said John Irvine, chief scientist for data analytics with Draper.

Full text: Austria's Conservatives and Greens agreed to form a new government in a move that could inspire similar alliances across Europe, where incumbent center-right parties are looking to harness rising voter interest in the environment to fight off insurgencies led by populist rivals.
The coalition under former Conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz was announced by both parties as a marriage between liberal economic reforms, including tax cuts, and new environmental policies driven by the growing popular movement in Europe demanding action against climate change.
The new government, which came together three months after federal elections in late September, is expected to pursue a reformist agenda that could put pressure on European leaders such as Angela Merkel of Germany, who has been criticized at home for failing to address voters' climate-related concerns.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Germany and across Europe calling for action on climate change throughout last year, which saw a record surge of the Green parties in the polls in Germany, Austria and elsewhere. According to polls in Germany, any feasible coalition at the moment would have to include an alliance between Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats and the Greens.
Mr. Kurz, an outspoken critic of illegal immigration and one of the rising hopes for Europe's conservatives, is now a chancellor-designate. He already served as chancellor until May 2019, when his coalition government collapsed because the leader of his then junior coalition partner, a far-right nationalist, resigned after video emerged of him offering public contracts to a woman he believed to be the niece of a Moscow oligarch. Austria has been under a caretaker government since then.
Though the scandal led to a snap election, Mr. Kurz -- one of the world's youngest leaders at age 33 -- weathered the crisis and achieved a record result for his conservative party in September. Like President Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Mr. Kurz remodeled his conservative party after his own image before winning the elections. He campaigned on an anti-immigration ticket and a promise to cut taxes and reform Austria's social and welfare systems.
"We achieved a breakthrough," Mr. Kurz told a press conference in Vienna on Wednesday night after the coalition talks. "It is possible to slash taxes and make environment-friendly tax policies. It is possible to protect the environment and protect the borders."
Mr. Kurz said the coalition agreement united what he called the best policies of the conservatives and the Greens. He said his new government would deliver tax breaks and effective environmental and climate policies, while maintaining a hard line against illegal immigration and political Islam.
Werner Kogler, the designated vice chancellor and head of the Greens, said Austria would become Europe's leader in environmental policies.
Concessions that Mr. Kurz's party extracted from the coalition talks include a ban on the Islamic veil for girls younger than 14, according to people familiar with the negotiations, while the Greens got Mr. Kurz to accept an environmental tax for trucks and airplane tickets.

Full text: BEIJING -- China's efforts to wean itself off coal are losing steam, as the world's biggest carbon emitter is putting economic growth and energy security above its ambitions to be a leader in combating climate change.
Coal consumption is back near peak levels after rebounding over the past three years, despite China's pledges to make steep cuts in what is the country's most prevalent and polluting source of energy. The country is building more coal-fired plant capacity than the rest of the world combined.
Infrastructure stimulus measures to offset the impact of the prolonged trade war with the U.S. have boosted consumption, while Beijing has taken a softer stance on coal use after a missile attack in September on Saudi Arabia, China's biggest source of oil imports, underscored the country's reliance on foreign energy.
The renewed focus on coal has raised doubts among analysts over China's commitment to cutting carbon emissions and frustrated the European Union, which has leaned on China to uphold the Paris Agreement since President Trump pulled the U.S. out in 2017. While China is on track to meet its goals through 2020 and 2030, its mixed signals on coal suggest Beijing is less willing to pursue green-energy goals and join the EU in setting more-ambitious emission targets.
"China was seen, particularly by the developing and emerging economies, as the leader, saying look at all the wonderful stuff we're doing," said Philip Andrews-Speed, senior principal fellow at the Energy Studies Institute at the National University of Singapore. But the country has continued construction on new coal plants even as it aims to phase out the fossil fuel, he said: "There's a deep contradiction in this."
In an October speech at a National Energy Commission meeting, Premier Li Keqiang called for the development of the coal industry to ensure energy security. The remarks were widely seen as a shift from previous statements and a sign that the government is backing off its anticoal message.
Efforts to boost the economy through infrastructure investment have also driven overall consumption higher, analysts said.
China's steel output reached a record 750 million metric tons in 2019, but will likely come back down in 2020 as housing construction slows, according to Charles Li, associate director at Fitch Ratings. Data from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air show coal demand has increased by 7% and 11% in metals and chemicals sectors, respectively, this year through October.
"China had a very genuine claim to being a leader on climate change," said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. "Now that there has been a domestic shift, that's harder to portray."
In 2014, China and the U.S. agreed to coordinate on carbon-emission cuts in an effort to propel international negotiations. That year, coal consumption fell for the first time in China after peaking in 2013.
"Climate was seen as a key positive area of the relationship between China and the United States and that really gave it additional priority," Mr. Myllyvirta added.
After Mr. Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China initially positioned itself as an emerging leader in the efforts to combat climate change. But without the same pressure from the U.S., some analysts said, China's commitment has waned in the face of other economic and political challenges.
One effect of the trade war between the U.S. and China is an increased emphasis on pursuing energy independence, which has likely contributed to support for coal, said Erica Downs, senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.
"You have this balancing act going on," Ms. Downs said. "They're still committing to cleaning and greening the energy mix, but it's not always a linear progression."

Full text: The debate over climate change intensified over the decade, amid several of the hottest years on record, several extreme weather events and the publication of a wave of reports on warming. That -- along with attention to the issue by policymakers in many countries and increasingly heated rhetoric -- brought the issue to the doorstep of business, in the form of environmental disclosures, carbon pledges and green investment.
Big companies, like Amazon.com and Nestle, set out ambitious -- if long-term -- plans to become carbon-neutral over decades. A few companies shifted their focus, such as Equinor AS, a European integrated oil company that turned toward renewable energy.
Climate activists focused a lot of their energy on companies, saying they have a long way to go. A faster pace, they say, will be necessary not only to prevent the worst effects of climate change, but also to sustain businesses as regulations evolve. "If this is what taking climate change seriously looks like, then we have some real problems," says Lewis Grant, senior equities portfolio manager at Hermes Investment Management. "Most companies recognize man-made climate change, but they're underestimating the risks."
Companies unveiling efforts to address climate change face steep challenges. The transportation industry remains dependent on fossil fuels, for instance. Change is also slow in agriculture. Total emissions from global livestock represent some 14.5% of all human-related greenhouse-gas emissions, according to the United Nations.
Agriculture giants have signed pledges against deforestation and in favor of better soil management and net-zero emissions. But tied up with reducing agricultural emissions is a full-scale change in food culture around the world.
Meanwhile, activist investors drove a multibillion-dollar ESG sector with goals of investing in companies with strong environmental, social and governance practices.
Global investment in renewable power and fuels has risen in recent years, climbing to $289 billion in 2018 from $177 billion 10 years earlier, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That growth hasn't been uninterrupted, though; 2018's figure was down from $326 billion in 2017.
Investment "has changed, and investors are working more closely with companies who are authentic in their efforts to curb climate change, but they've become more vocal and organized with the companies who have not," says Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management Inc.

Full text: Every Monday at 8 p.m. since November, Bulawayo residents have gathered next to their toilets to prepare for a ritual that has come to be known as the big flush -- another sign of a water emergency across southern Africa.
For the 700,000 residents of Zimbabwe's second-largest city, flushing outside government-mandated times puts them at the risk of being fined.
Economies in the region are reeling from a second historic drought in three years, leaving 45 million people facing water and food crises, according to the United Nations. That marks a sharp rise in recent years, the U.N. and other aid agencies said.
In Zambia, a drought that has ravaged the corn harvest is forcing families to survive on wild plants and roots, while in Namibia, 30,000 drought-related cattle deaths have been recorded since April and some 200 elephants have starved to death in national parks along the Zambezi River.
Since December, the volume of water pouring from the Zambezi over the massive Victoria Falls, at the border where Zimbabwe meets Zambia, has fallen more than 50% to its lowest level in 25 years, alarming government officials who have suggested that models predict that the falls could one day run dry.
"The pictures of the Victoria Falls are a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment and our livelihood," Zambian President Edgar Lungu said this month. "No doubt that developing countries like Zambiaare the most impacted by climate change and the least able to afford its consequences."
He has outlined steps his government is taking in an effort to head off the crisis. Zambia, he said, is promoting agricultural practices including the pursuit of drought-resistant food crops, construction of more-resilient roads and water-harvesting facilities, and strengthening the regulation of groundwater resources.
One of the key drivers changing southern Africa's climate is accelerating deforestation, as growing populations are cutting into forests to sell timber to Asian and Western markets. The forests act like giant sponges that absorb carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas that contributes to global warming.
Hotter and drier summers have accompanied the loss of forest cover, with temperatures expected to rise at twice the global average in the region across Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Namibia and Mozambique. This year, southern Africa has seen its lowest rainfall since it was first recorded in 1981, according to the Botswana-based intergovernmental organization Southern African Development Community.
Last week, South Africa's Weather Service issued a flood warning for multiple provinces following unusually heavy rains, although abnormally hot weather continues in some parts of the country.
"We need to accept that climate change is a reality and it continues to create imbalances in our rainfall patterns and seasonal changes," Lindiwe Sisulu, South Africa's water and sanitation minister, said this month.
The drought problem seems most acute in Zimbabwe, where the extreme weather comes amid an economic emergency.
"The droughts are different now," said Thandiwe Sibanda, a 32-year-old mother of two in the capital, Harare. She hasn't had running water for months and now wakes up at 4 a.m. to fetch water from a community well.

Full text: Climate negotiators failed to strengthen targets to cut emissions or to create a global carbon-trading system, two main goals of the 2015 Paris accord, as the impending U.S. exit from the pact exacerbated challenges to cut record-high planet-warming gases.
Delegates from nearly 200 nations sparred for two weeks in Madrid at the annual United Nations climate summit without setting new emissions targets before next year's U.N. convention in Glasgow or creating a framework to reward and encourage efforts to cut emissions.
"Regretfully, after all the hard work that you have all done we couldn't get to an agreement," said Chile's Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, who presided over the summit that ended Sunday. "The new generations expect more from us."
Outside the conference, activists representing environmentalists, youth groups and endangered communities demanded action to curb global warming. Inside the venue, President Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's climate skepticism clashed with a European-led coalition pressing for ambitious rules to enforce the Paris pact.
Financing to help poorer countries transition into less-polluting technology also proved contentious. The issue deepened the divide between less-developed countries that account for a fraction of greenhouse-gas releases and economic powers responsible for the vast majority of it.
Many scientists warn that the threat of climate change attributed to human activities is growing more urgent. Long-term effects are being seen in coastal flooding, heat waves and changes in ecosystems, U.S. federal scientists said this year.
The last five years have been the hottest since temperatures have been measured. In September, a scientific panel under U.N. auspices said oceans are warming and ice sheets disappearing and that human communities and wildlife are at risk.
"We lack the ambition needed to avoid this climate emergency," Norway's youth delegate to the U.N. summit, Sofie Nordvik, said Sunday. "Our leaders need to step up . . . we don't have the time."
Major powers that account for more than 75% of human-generated global emissions -- including China, the U.S., the European Union, India and Russia -- risk missing their emissions-reduction goals. Some countries are also taking steps that further undermine the climate pact.
China, the top emitter globally, is adding more coal-fired plants than the rest of the world combined, while also building them internationally. The U.S., the world's second-largest emitter, is rolling back emissions-reducing rules on energy and transport enacted by the Obama administration. U.S. carbon emissions rose 3.4% in 2018, after three years of declines, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
"The world's largest emitters are not pulling their weight, and without them our goal is unreachable," U.N. Secretary- General Antonio Guterres said before the climate summit convened. As talks concluded, he added: "The international community lost an important opportunity."
In an effort to counter the backtracking among major powers, the EU committed on Friday to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. EU member Poland, however, declined to implement the plan until at least June and demanded financial guarantees to transition its economy, which relies 80% on coal-fired power.
The EU, the world's third-largest emitter, pushed at the U.N. summit for rules on international carbon markets. In the end, European negotiators refused demands from countries including Brazil, India and Australia.
The Brazil-led efforts, European negotiators and climate activists say, would lead to double-counting of emission cuts and usher in a trove of carbon credits granted under the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris accord's predecessor.
Those would contribute to watering down the climate pact and amount to cosmetic emissions cuts without arresting rising temperatures, these people said.
"We are disappointed," the EU delegation said in a Sunday statement. "We cannot support global rules which would undermine environmental integrity."
Despite the setback to a global carbon market, an existing framework suffices for national and regional initiatives, say climate experts. The EU already has the world's biggest emissions trading system, covering energy-heavy industrial plants. This month, the EU and Switzerland linked their carbon markets, signaling a way forward for other countries.
Developing countries need more than $4.4 trillion from 2020 through 2030 to implement measures under the Paris accord.
"Anybody out of the continent saying we should not develop [oil and gas] fields, that is criminal. It is very unfair," Equatorial Guinea's Mines, Industry and Energy Minister Gabriel Obiang Lima said recently.

Full text: Companies increasingly talk about being climate positive, but they disagree on what that means and how to measure it.
Mounting concerns about rising temperatures and other environmental impacts from human consumption are propelling consumer-facing brands to make a variety of green pledges. But the proliferation of terms tied to this effort is stirring debate and dissent.
Environmentalists and some companies worry that ambiguity is hurting environmental progress, confusing consumers and opening the door to greenwashing -- where companies appear more sustainable than they are.
"Our objective is to avoid a huge divergence in what it means to be climate positive," said Mark Griffiths, who works on climate issues at the World Wide Fund for Nature.
WWF facilitated an event this week in Madrid at the United Nations conference on climate change, known as COP25, for companies to discuss the parameters for a global definition.
It isn't clear how this would be implemented, but executives say an independent certification body could help set standards and verify they are being followed.
Companies broadly agree that being climate positive entails reducing more greenhouse-gas emissions than they emit but differ on how this should be achieved.
IKEA has pledged to be climate positive by the year 2030 and said last month that it would spend 200 million euros ($221 million) toward this effort.
It will shift to renewable energy, be more energy efficient, halve emissions tied to travel and invest in reforestation to remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it.
The furniture company is leading the drive to establish a definition and plans to outline its approach at the U.N. conference.
IKEA thinks companies should be climate positive on an absolute basis, regardless of growth, rather than a relative basis.
If a company pledges to be climate positive per product or dollar of revenue, overall emissions could rise, it says.
"We see many definitions, and it's important that it's a credible claim," said Andreas Ahrens, who is head of climate at Inter IKEA Group. "We don't want to mislead customers."
But getting companies to agree on even decades-old terms, like recyclable, can be challenging.
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation -- a U.K.-based nonprofit that has rallied more than 250 organizations to commit to slashing plastic waste -- this year published a definition of the term.
Many technically recyclable materials go to landfills because of high processing costs or poor infrastructure.
Agreeing on the definition took about a year, said Sander Defruyt, who works on plastics issues at the foundation.

Sandy Hook Gun Suit
Is Set for Trial in 2021
A lawsuit by families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims against Remington Arms will go to trial in September 2021, a Connecticut judge said Wednesday.
A survivor and relatives of nine victims of the 2012 massacre filed the wrongful-death suit against Remington in 2015, saying the company should never have sold such a dangerous weapon to the public and alleging it targeted younger, at-risk males in marketing and product placement in violent videogames.
Remington made the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used to kill 20 first-graders and six educators at the Newtown school.
The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in March that Remington could be sued under state law over how it marketed the rifle. The decision overturned a ruling by a state trial-court judge who dismissed the lawsuit based on a federal law that shields gun-makers from liability, in most cases, when their products are used in crimes. Remington appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case.

NEW YORK STATE
The Use of Aerial
Pesticide Is Banned
New York is prohibiting the aerial spraying of an agricultural pesticide that can harm the nervous systems of infants and children.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he is directing the state Department of Environmental Conservation to ban nearly all uses of the pesticide by December 2020. New York, however, will allow the spraying of the pesticide on apple tree trunks until July 2021.
The pesticide also poses the risk of acute poisoning and neurological damage in farmworkers, says Friends of the Earth, an Environmental group. Apple farmers have argued that chlorpyrifos is the only pesticide available for use against pests.

Governor Seeks to
Team Up on Climate
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont plans to work with his counterparts in Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey to address climate change, noting Wednesday that he hopes the coalition of states can set an example for the U.S.
Appearing before the newly expanded Governor's Council on Climate Change, the Democrat said state officials need to take action, given President Trump's skepticism of a warming planet.
The council has been charged with monitoring Connecticut's progress toward reducing the state's carbon emissions, eventually to 0%, by 2040. The group is scheduled to provide Mr. Lamont with a report on that progress by Jan. 15, 2021, and annually thereafter.
The council also will work with state agencies to come up with a strategy to assess and prepare for the impact of climate change in areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, natural resources and public health.
Mr. Lamont said Wednesday he wants Connecticut to be a leader on climate change, noting the state's goal of having a carbon-free electric grid by 2040 is more ambitious than neighboring states with a 2050 goal.

Full text: A New York state judge cleared Exxon Mobil Corp. of fraud claims, saying New York's attorney general had failed to establish that the oil company had deceived investors about how it accounted for the cost of future climate-change regulation.
The verdict Tuesday capped a nearly three-week civil trial between the state and Exxon, which had spent several years fighting the case. The company is battling similar accusations in other state and federal courts.
In his 55-page ruling, New York State Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager said the attorney general's office didn't prove that the company had violated the Martin Act, a broad antifraud statute commonly used to pursue financial crime, or other similar laws.
"The Office of the Attorney General failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Exxon Mobil made any material misstatements or omissions about its practices and procedures that misled any reasonable investor," Justice Ostrager wrote.
Still, he noted that the case and his ruling centered on allegations of securities fraud. "Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve Exxon Mobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases in the production of its fossil fuel products," the judge wrote.
During the trial, the office of Attorney General Letitia James accused the company of using two different accounting methods -- one public, and one internal -- to project its business costs in countries that were expected to implement policies to combat climate change.
How Exxon planned for these costs and their potential impact on the company's health mattered to investors, the office said, with the omission of the information resulting in an inflated stock price.
The attorney general estimated the damage to shareholders to be as much as $1.6 billion.
Lawyers for Exxon said the company, while acknowledging the existence of internal calculations, had done nothing wrong and that a reasonable investor wouldn't expect to have access to the information.
The company had also accused the attorney general's office of being motivated by politics in bringing the case.
A spokesman for Exxon said the ruling affirmed the company's position that it had provided investors with accurate information.
"The court agreed that the attorney general failed to make a case, even with the extremely low threshold of the Martin Act in its favor," the spokesman said.
Ms. James said that investors are entitled to the truth. "Despite this decision, we will continue to fight to ensure companies are held responsible for actions that undermine and jeopardize the financial health and safety of Americans across our country, and we will continue to fight to end climate change," she said.
During the trial's closing arguments, the attorney general's office dropped two of the four fraud counts from its case.
Lawyers for Exxon argued the office shouldn't be allowed to drop those counts and that the company deserved a ruling.
Justice Ostrager said by finding the attorney general hadn't proved the Martin Act-related counts, his ruling also established the company wasn't liable on the other fraud counts, which carry a higher burden of proof.
Exxon faces a similar lawsuit in state court in Massachusetts, whose attorney general's office has accused the company of deceiving investors about climate-change costs.
The Massachusetts suit also accuses Exxon of violating a state consumer-protection law by conducting a deceptive marketing campaign.
The company also faces shareholder lawsuits in federal courts in Texas and New Jersey that allege violations of federal securities law and accuse the company of deceiving investors.
In all those cases, Exxon has denied wrongdoing.

Factories Revive After
Six-Month Contraction
Activity in China's factories unexpectedly expanded in November, according to an official measure, ending six months of contraction, as both domestic and external demand showed signs of improvement.
In spite of the surprise uptick, economists say it's too soon to conclude that the fortunes of the world's second largest economy are back on track, given a raft of uncertainties, including rising consumer inflation and lingering uncertainty over whether Beijing and Washington can ink a partial trade deal.
China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 50.2 in November, up from 49.3 in October, the National Bureau of Statistics said Saturday. It was the first time in the past seven months that the key gauge of manufacturing activity registered above the 50 mark, which separates expansion from contraction. The result was also higher than the median forecast of 49.5 among 11 economists polled earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
Official data showed the production subindex jumping to 52.6 in November, compared with 50.8 in October.

SINGAPORE
Facebook Ordered to
Correct User's Post
Authorities directed Facebook Inc. to publish a correction to a post by a user on the social-media website, marking the first test for the tech giant since Singapore passed a sweeping law this year to combat what it sees as online falsehoods and fake news.
The government said Friday that it had issued a "targeted correction direction" to Facebook in connection with a post containing allegations that authorities had made a wrongful arrest. No such arrest had been made, the government said.
Its order requires Facebook to publish a "correction notice" in a way that users of the platform in Singapore who see the original post also see the correction.
How Facebook responds to the order will set the course for social-media regulation in the country and influence so-called fake-news laws taking shape elsewhere. Facebook has argued it doesn't adjudicate on whether material posted on its website is true or false. Facebook declined to comment on whether it would comply with the Singapore order.
The law is called Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Global Protests Held
Ahead of Conference
Protesters in cities across the world staged rallies Friday demanding leaders take tougher action against climate change, days before the latest global conference, which this year takes place in Madrid.
The rallies kicked off in Australia, where people affected by recent devastating wildfires joined environmentalists protesting against the government's pro-coal stance. Janet Reynolds said she had come to the rally in Sydney after losing everything in an "inferno, an absolute firestorm that raced through my property."
Teenage activist Greta Thunberg, who is traveling across the Atlantic by sailboat to attend the climate talks, sent a message of support to protesters. "Everyone's needed. Everyone's welcome. Join us," she tweeted.
Further rallies took place in Germany, Hungary, Belgium, South Korea, Poland, England, Turkey, Italy, Spain and France. "The generations before us messed it up," said 17-year-old Robin Ebelt in Germany. "And we're the ones that will feel the consequences. I would like to spend another 60 years on this planet, grow old and have grandchildren."

Full text: Tracey Henderson is a rare woman at the top ranks of an energy company who calls the shots on where to drill for oil and gas -- and in a world where big energy outfits have cut back on massive exploration projects, she is responsible for one of this year's biggest discoveries.
As chief exploration officer for Kosmos Energy Ltd., Ms. Henderson led the effort that located a big natural-gas field off the coast of West Africa.
Kosmos, a $2.6 billion market-cap company focused on exploration, discovered the field in partnership with BP PLC, and announced the Orca-1 well find in late October. The field, offshore Mauritania, holds around 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to the consulting firm Rystad Energy.
When Kosmos first began working in the area, "the region was underexplored and overlooked by the industry. We saw it differently and drilled nine successful wells and have had three major discoveries," she says.
Armed with degrees in geology and geophysics, Ms. Henderson, 53 years old, spent the early part of her career in technical energy-industry roles, before moving into management. She joined Dallas-based Kosmos in 2004 and ascended to her current position this past February, at a time when many energy companies were operating with exploration budgets that were slashed during a 2014 downturn in oil prices.
In an interview, Ms. Henderson talked about how to be a good boss, the importance of energy exploration and climate change.
Edited excerpts:
WSJ: What's easier, reading rocks or reading people?
Ms. Henderson: [Laughs] I feel like I'm pretty good at both, actually. Rocks are second nature because I have been doing it for so long, but I have also learned that in a role where you are outside of your expertise, having good emotional quotient and being able to read people is hugely beneficial.
WSJ: What kind of boss are you?
Ms. Henderson: You would probably need to ask my staff that but I can tell you what kind of boss I aspire to be, and that's one who is fair, somebody who listens. The other critical piece is to strive to support them and be there when they need me and not be there when they don't -- let them do their jobs.
WSJ: How is the industry responding to climate change?
Ms. Henderson: There is an acknowledgment by most companies that climate change is a front-and-center issue. And they are taking steps to move toward a lighter [carbon-emissions] mix in their portfolio.
Most people believe peak demand for oil will come much sooner than peak demand for gas because gas is a cleaner supply of energy than oil.
The big question is how renewables -- such as solar and wind -- will start to come into the mix and supplement their portion of supply.
[At Kosmos] we are already really well positioned with our giant gas fields in Mauritania and Senegal. I think oil will still be a big part of the equation near the midterm. So we will remain active with our proven oil basins and in exploration footprints around the Gulf of Mexico, Equatorial Guinea and Sao Tome but also elsewhere.
We will be very happy with additional gas discoveries going forward and we want to position ourselves to play a role in the energy transition as well.

Full text: BRUSSELS -- A growing rift between Paris and Berlin threatens the Franco-German engine that has powered many of Europe's biggest projects.
French President Emmanuel Macron advocates bold plans centered on positioning the European Union as a force between the U.S. and China. But his disruptive style and grand ambitions have irked Germany, the biggest contributor to EU funding, and its leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel.
That discord across the Rhine could hamper efforts of the EU's incoming leadership, which takes office on Dec. 1, to push far-reaching plans -- many of them in line with Mr. Macron's proposals -- on climate change, technology, defense and the bloc's finances.
"We don't need to turn the existing order upside down," Ms. Merkel told a rally in Croatia recently, in reference to Mr. Macron's earlier description of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as "brain-dead."
German reaction to other EU initiatives championed by the French president has ranged from indifference and muted support to hostility.
In October, Ms. Merkel pledged to back Mr. Macron's push to halve greenhouse-gas emissions in Europe by 2030 and eliminate them altogether by 2050, following months of quarrels within her coalition over how far to push climate policies. But her position lacks the support of conservative cabinet members who say the plan would disproportionately hurt heavily industrialized Germany.
Meanwhile, many Germans -- not just politicians -- oppose French proposals to tighten EU economic integration, fearing Germany will foot the bill.
Even on issues where the two leaders broadly agree, differences complicate cooperation. Both say Europe must assert itself more against tech giants based in the U.S. and China, in an approach known as digital sovereignty.
But Ms. Merkel favors allowing China's Huawei to bid for her country's 5G networks. Mr. Macron wants tighter restrictions, recently telling the Economist that European inaction would mean that "in 10 years' time, no one will be able to guarantee the technological soundness of your cybersystems, no one will be able to guarantee who processes the data, and how, of citizens or companies."
Personal animosity between the two leaders further complicates matters, European officials say.
"They never got along well, but now it's particularly bad," said a senior EU official who has participated in meetings alongside the two leaders. The two reportedly clashed at the EU summit in October over the bloc's enlargement plans.
The U.K.'s imminent exit from the EU exacerbates such Franco-German friction, which has surfaced in different contexts throughout the decadeslong history of the bloc.
"The U.K. was balancing them out, but now they're on their own to shout at each other," the official said.
European defense is an area where the two might seem to agree, but don't. Like Mr. Macron, Ms. Merkel supports greater Franco-German defense cooperation and developing an EU fund for joint purchases of military equipment. But she doesn't question NATO's utility, as Mr. Macron does.
Mr. Macron has said Europe should rethink its enlargement policy and streamline rules governing the bloc before adding members. Ms. Merkel says that unless nations in the Balkans are given hopes of joining the bloc, conflicts there might resume, strengthening the hand of Russia and other foreign powers in a region near the center of Europe.
Mr. Macron, halfway through his first term, advocates granting the 19 EU countries that use the euro more leeway on national budgets. He has also pushed for a eurozone-only budget, a position noneuro members have said would deepen the divide between eastern and western EU states.
Germany gave those plans a cold shoulder last year amid Ms. Merkel's lengthy coalition-forming process and her domestic quarrels over climate policy, frustrating and disappointing the French president.
"Macron was probably expecting too much," said Tara Varma, head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank. "He didn't take into account that Germany has a coalition government that can't agree on many issues and that Merkel isn't looking to transform Europe."
Ms. Merkel, approaching the end of her fourth and last term in office, is displaying less tolerance for Mr. Macron's brashness. When Mr. Macron in October blocked North Macedonia and Albania from launching EU membership talks even though both met all preconditions, Ms. Merkel said his opposition would damage the bloc's credibility. "We need to be reliable," she said.

Full text: AMES, Iowa -- Michaelyn Mankel says she felt the environment was in such peril that she dropped out of college 11 credits shy of graduating in 2018. Now, she is working to get a president elected who will aggressively target climate change.
Ms. Mankel, 24 years old, and 19 others from the political action group Sunrise Movement have collected roughly 12,000 pledges from young people across Iowa and New Hampshire to vote for candidates who support the Green New Deal, a wide-ranging and costly proposal to reshape the economy to be emissions-neutral within 10 years and shift away from fossil fuels.
Younger Americans are more likely than their older counterparts to say they are concerned about climate change and to endorse major action to combat it. Activists are hoping to harness that anxiety and use it to urge 2020 Democratic candidates to take more ambitious positions on climate issues. Then, they want young people to show up at the polls and vote for the candidate willing to be most aggressive.
Ms. Mankel generated 1.3 million views on Twitter for a September video in which she pressured Joe Biden in person for attending a fundraiser co-hosted by the founder of a liquefied natural gas company, among other things, an interaction for which she said she spent more than five hours preparing.
"I was confident that I was speaking not only for myself, but for tens of thousands of young people across the country," said Ms. Mankel. The Biden campaign pointed out that Mr. Biden had introduced one of the first pieces of climate legislation and had a B+ rating with the environmental organization Greenpeace.
Nearly every Democratic presidential hopeful is backing a climate-change agenda that is more amenable to the activists than what the party supported in 2016. Still, activists say only a handful want the kind of drastic overhaul to the U.S. economy they believe is necessary.
Achieving that goal faces headwinds. In the past, young people have voted at lower rates than their older peers. But there was an uptick in the 2018 election, according to the U.S. Census.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from September found that while a majority of young people said the U.S. should ban offshore drilling, most voters over the age of 35 disagreed. And while almost two-thirds of young people said the U.S. should shift to renewable resources, less than half of their older peers agreed.
Ms. Mankel and her fellow canvassers stood outside the library at Iowa State University in Ames recently and asked students if they were worried about climate change. Most who walked by said they were, though many didn't stop.
Jack Kinseth, 20, responded, "Oh my God, everything," when asked what worried him about climate change.
"The existential anxiety that comes as a result of the data pertaining to how climate change will evolve within my lifetime and over future generations, I can't quantify it," Mr. Kinseth said.
Another Iowa State student, James Gilpatric, 19, was standing just down the sidewalk at a table set up in support of President Trump's re-election. He said he didn't deny that climate change was happening, but he played down the significance.
"I don't think it's as big as people make it out to be. Like, I don't think it's an existential threat and we're all going to die," he said, adding he was concerned that big steps like enacting the Green New Deal could destroy the economy.
---
Floods, Fires Spur
Greater Concern
Young Democratic activists say their concern over the effects of climate change has been building due to recent floods and wildfires.
The urgency also increased, they said, after a 2018 report from a United Nations-led scientific panel warned of a devastating future if governments don't cut 2010 levels of global carbon dioxide emissions in half in 12 years and effectively end them by around 2050. Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish activist who sailed across the Atlantic in a racing yacht to call attention to carbon footprints, has become an icon of the movement.
"There's been a wholesale change in the sort of emotional dynamic of the climate change issue since the new generations have sparked this outcry of moral indignation," said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination with a focus on climate change but dropped out after failing to gain momentum.

Full text: The New York attorney general's office Thursday dropped part of its securities-fraud case against Exxon Mobil Corp. on the final day of a rare climate-change-related trial that has pushed the oil giant's accounting practices into public view.
Attorney general's office lawyers withdrew two fraud counts at the end of a nearly three-week trial examining Exxon's public and private estimates of potential climate-change regulations on its future business. But the attorney general's office proceeded with two counts that require the elements of the Martin Act, a New York state antifraud law with a lower bar of proof: that Exxon made misrepresentations to investors and that those deceptions mattered.
The attorney general's office pulled back the civil fraud counts during closing arguments of a trial that has been closely watched for its implications for the largest American oil company and the energy industry in general.
Attorney General Letitia James has accused Exxon of deceiving its investors about its financial modeling for policies that countries might enact to combat climate change. The oil company told investors it used one formula to account for these future regulations, but internally used lower numbers, the office has argued.
Jonathan Zweig, a lawyer in the attorney general's office, said the case wasn't about whether Exxon's employees were good people, as the company's lawyers suggested. "The question in this case is whether Exxon's disclosures were accurate," Mr. Zweig said. "And the evidence shows that they were not."
Lawyers for Exxon have called the case meritless and said reasonable investors wouldn't expect to know such proprietary calculations. "Exxon Mobil did not have two sets of books," Theodore Wells Jr., a lawyer for Exxon, said Thursday. "Exxon Mobil had two distinct metrics that were used for different purposes."
In court Thursday, Mr. Wells asked the judge not to drop the fraud counts, saying the company had a right to receive a ruling on those claims. The claims had damaged the reputation of the company and its executives, he said.
"That leaves a cloud over the reputation of the people," he said.
"Because of this case, and it's all connected, we have got copycat cases tracking this case word-for-word in private federal-securities cases, books and record cases," Mr. Wells said.
Mr. Wells said the Massachusetts attorney general had recently sued the company as well. A spokeswoman for the Massachusetts attorney general didn't respond to a request for comment.
State Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager said that while he believed the New York attorney general had a right to withdraw the claims, he would read the lawyers' written arguments on the matter.He has indicated he would rule on the case in as little as a month.
If Justice Ostrager rules in favor of the attorney general, it could spur further lawsuits or investigations into Exxon and other oil companies.A ruling in Exxon's favor would likely insulate the company against such claims, and, from the company's perspective, bolster its reputation on climate-change issues.
Either side would likely appeal the judge's ruling.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has officially started the process of exiting the Paris climate agreement, citing an unfair economic burden on American workers and businesses, the State Department said.
The U.S. submitted the notification to the United Nations on Monday and the process will take one year to complete. The U.S. will continue to seek to reduce emissions through research and innovation, the State Department said.
President Trump said in 2017 that he would withdraw the U.S. from the treaty, which aims to cap carbon-dioxide emissions and curb the global rise in temperatures. He said it unfairly penalized American workers.
The Obama administration helped shape the accord, which went into force on Nov. 4, 2016, after 55 signatories representing over half of total emissions ratified it, including the U.S., China and the European Union. Since then, 187 countries have ratified the agreement.
The Paris treaty was designed to make it difficult for countries to leave the deal once it was ratified; the process could only be started three years after the effective date of the agreement.
The Obama administration pledged to aim to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by the year 2025. Mr. Trump could have chosen to reduce the target, which is set by each country voluntarily, a move that would have weakened the pact but kept the U.S. inside the accord.
In September, Russia joined the growing list of countries that have ratified the treaty. A future president could re-enter the pact.
The exit is due to be completed on Nov. 4 next year, a day after the 2020 elections.
The Paris Accord sought to strengthen the impact of the Kyoto Protocol, which legally bound signatories to reduce emissions, but failed to get the two major polluters on board -- the U.S. and China.
Mr. Trump's decision follows student protests around the world ahead of the United Nations summit on climate change, calling on nations to do more to address the issue. The average global temperature already is 1.1 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, according to World Meteorological Organization estimates.
Mr. Trump has also fought efforts at home to take steps to regulate emissions. In October, the Trump administration filed suit to shut down California's emissions-trading market designed to limit air pollution. In September, it revoked the state's ability to set its own vehicle emission standards.
Experts and former U.S. officials said the decision to withdraw from the accord reflected a divergence between federal policy and efforts by states and companies to reduce emissions.
"A growing number of companies are setting strong emission-reduction goals, ramping up their investments in climate solutions, and supporting effective climate policies," said Bob Perciasepe, former Environmental Protection Agency deputy administrator under President Obama.
U.S. carbon emissions rose 3.4% in 2018, after three years of declines, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Emissions were still down 11.2% from 2005 levels.
Andrew Light, a former State Department official involved in the Paris climate talks, said that future U.S. efforts to rejoin the deal could be complicated as the treaty requires signatories to set 2030 targets next year.

Full text: YOKOSUKA, Japan -- Shinjiro Koizumi has led a charmed existence since he entered Japan's Parliament a decade ago, taking over a seat held by his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
Now, the political prince is being tested in his first cabinet position as he attempts to wean Japan from its dependence on coal, which accounts for more than a quarter of the nation's electricity.
Educated at Columbia University, the 38-year-old Mr. Koizumi is one of the youngest lawmakers in postwar history to join Japan's cabinet.
He was named environment minister in September by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and, fresh off his marriage to glamorous, half-French television personality Christel Takigawa, he looked ready to follow in his father's footsteps.
Almost immediately after taking office, Mr. Koizumi encouraged environmentalists.
"We are committed to realizing a decarbonized society and we are ready to contribute as a more powerful country in the fight against climate change," he said in New York on the eve of the United Nations Climate Change Summit in September.
Tackling climate change has to be made "fun," "cool" and "sexy," he added.
Back home, however, big businesses that support Mr. Abe's government and officials in charge of energy say a shortage of power isn't an option.
Mr. Koizumi's political future hinges on whether he can advance his pledge to decarbonize Japan without making enemies of the establishment.
"Mr. Koizumi has a great chance of success in his future career if he can show his political capability in tackling the issue of coal," said Yukari Takamura, a University of Tokyo professor specializing in environmental and international law.
Environmentalists also are pushing to halt construction of a coal-fired power plant in Mr. Koizumi's own parliamentary district south of Tokyo.
But "suddenly stopping new coal plants would prove extremely difficult," said Atsuo Sawaki, a manager at Jera Co., the company that just started building the plant.
Asked about coal at a recent press conference, Mr. Koizumi avoided the language he had used in New York. He said Japan was trying to "reduce our level of dependence on thermal power including coal-fired power as much as possible."
Unlike some countries taking an anticoal stance, Mr. Koizumi said Japan wasn't blessed with natural resources. "As a major economic power, we need diverse energy sources. I would like people to understand the circumstances we face," he said.
Politicians around the world are grappling with the future of coal, including President Trump, who wants to boost coal and calls environmental regulations too strict, to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose withdrawal from nuclear power has raised her country's reliance on the fuel.
Japan is similar to Germany because public opposition after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdowns of 2011 has made it difficult to restart nuclear reactors taken offline and virtually impossible to complete new projects. Today, only a quarter of Japan's operable nuclear reactors have been restarted.
Among the leaders of the antinuclear campaign is none other than Mr. Koizumi's father, who said he was misled about nuclear power's safety while prime minister from 2001 to 2006 and had his eyes opened by the Fukushima accident. In a speech in September, the now-77-year-old Mr. Koizumi said of his son: "I want him to get rid of nuclear energy and make this a country that can flourish with renewable energy."
While renewables are growing, net coal-fired capacity is also expected to grow by 6.8 gigawatts from 2019 to 2023, said Shirley Zhang, a coal-market analyst at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. "Anything on the downside of nuclear could bring more upside to coal," she said.
In Mr. Koizumi's district, construction began in August on a 1.3-gigawatt coal-fired power plant due to begin partial operation in 2023. It is set to emit 7.26 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually.
The new coal plant replaces an older plant that used to operate on the site, and, as a result, it received a simplified environmental assessment.
A local group is suing to block it. "If we don't stop the current construction of coal plants, Japan will not be able to meet the requirements of the Paris climate treaty," said Rikuro Suzuki, a representative of the group. "As environment minister, this is Mr. Koizumi's job."
The environment ministry is weak, though, compared with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which is in charge of energy policy and supports the Yokosuka plant.
Backers of coal plants say renewable energy isn't ready to take a leading role because it is too costly and intermittent. Costs from renewable-energy subsidies are passed on to the public in the form of $22 billion added to electricity bills in the current fiscal year, according to the industry ministry.
Mr. Sawaki of Jera, the coal-plant builder, points to Japan's need to diversify energy sources away from the Middle East. Much of Japan's liquefied natural gas comes from Qatar and other risky zones, while it can buy coal from Australia and the U.S.
Jera has several new plants in the pipeline that run on natural gas, which produces lower carbon emissions than coal. Its new coal-fired plant in Yokosuka will be more efficient and cleaner than the plant it is replacing, Mr. Sawaki said.
"We are trying to decrease emissions as a whole," he said.
The gradualist approach isn't enough for Junya Ogawa, a member of Parliament who wants taxes placed on polluters to combat global warming. He pressed Mr. Koizumi at a parliamentary debate in October.
"Be it sexy, cool, charming -- just do something," Mr. Ogawa said.

Full text: SUSAN COLLINS LAUNCHES EFFORT TO SAVE HER SEAT, and potentially the Senate majority, from Democrats. The Maine Republican debuted two new advertisements this week, touting her bipartisan credentials and pushing back on attacks from "extreme left groups." One ad credits her for bringing "thousands of good-paying jobs to Bath Iron Works," a major shipyard owned by General Dynamics that produces military vessels.
On Wednesday, Collins attended a Washington fundraiser for her campaign hosted by the political action committee for Huntington Ingalls Industries, the chief competitor of Bath Iron Works, according to an invitation seen by The Wall Street Journal. The two companies have clashed over billions of dollars worth of Navy contracts. Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a lobbyist for Huntington Ingalls, co-hosted the fundraiser. A spokesman for Sen. Collins didn't respond to requests to comment.
Collins is fundraising aggressively for her campaign, attending another D.C. fete earlier this week and one hosted by billionaire Stephen Schwarzman in New York last week. But she still trailed her top opponent, Democrat Sara Gideon, in third-quarter fundraising by more than $1 million.
ELIZABETH WARREN wades into local races with support for Working Families Party candidates for Philadelphia City Council elections next week. Warren is alone among presidential candidates to endorse in the race, despite requests from activists that Bernie Sanders step in. The WFP candidates are running for two designated minority-party seats on the City Council, long held by Republicans, in an election that could push the council's political center of gravity farther to the left. Sanders's campaign didn't respond to requests to comment.
Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney became the first big-city mayor to endorse Warren last week. Warren has been a thorn in the side of another Democratic mayor of late, rallying with the Chicago Teachers Union as it went on strike against the administration of new Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Other Democrats, including Sanders and Joe Biden, backed the CTU as well, but Warren was the only one to show up on the picket line.
GOP RETIREMENTS thin the ranks of congressional Republicans who pushed the party to come up with solutions for dealing with climate change. Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, who pushed for carbon capture and expanded use of hydropower and nuclear energy as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, will retire after two years in the minority. Illinois Rep. John Shimkus, who favored a similar approach, is also retiring (though he says he may reconsider), along with coastal Florida Rep. Francis Rooney, who warned of rising sea levels.
"It's depressing that talented, thoughtful, sincere leaders like Greg Walden are walking away from Congress,"says former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who worked on climate change issues before losing his seat in 2018. Still, he said there was a gradual shift occurring among Republicans on climate change.
INDIANA REPUBLICANS made up more than a third of votes against a House resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide. Members in opposition included Greg Pence, the vice president's brother, and Susan Brooks, the retiring House Republican recruitment chair. None responded to requests to comment. A Pence staffer met recently with an Armenian National Committee of America representative, but was apparently unswayed by the visit. "Those folks are operating on an obsolete understanding of the U.S.'s relationship" with Turkey, which opposes recognition of the genocide, said Aram Hamparian, the ANCA's executive director. Turkey dismissed the resolution as a "meaningless political step" to placate the "Armenian lobby."
RANKS OF UNINSURED CHILDREN grow, wiping out a large share of the gains in coverage following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014. A new Georgetown University Health Policy Institute study shows an uptick in uninsured children to 4.1 million after a record low of 3.6 million in 2016. The report cites factors including the 2017 repeal of the individual mandate penalty, a delayed extension to the Children's Health Insurance Program, and fewer resources for ACA enrollment efforts under the Trump administration.

Full text: SUPERSTORM SANDY
Murphy Commits
To Resiliency Plan
On the seventh anniversary of superstorm Sandy, New Jersey's governor committed the state to a far-reaching plan to deal with climate change and protect itself from future storms.
Democrat Phil Murphy signed an executive order Tuesday in Hoboken. The order establishes a statewide climate-change resiliency strategy involving 16 state agencies.
Led by an official in the Department of Environmental Protection, the group will write a report on how best to deal with rising sea levels, warming seas and stronger and more frequent storms. It is to be delivered to the governor by Sept. 1, 2020.
"New Jersey is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of sea-level rise and global warming, and today's executive order outlines a bold and comprehensive set of actions to ensure that our communities and infrastructure are more resilient against future storms," Mr. Murphy said.

New Terminal C
Opens at LaGuardia
Delta Air Lines' new Terminal C is opening at LaGuardia Airport, part of an $8 billion project to modernize the entire facility.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo joined Delta CEO Ed Bastian and other officials for a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Tuesday.
Seven new gates will begin operating next Monday. The terminal eventually will have 37 gates across four concourses.
Last December, a new concourse opened in LaGuardia's Terminal B, which serves American, United, Southwest and Air Canada.
Other planned improvements include more tarmac space to reduce gate delays, restaurants and other amenities, new roads and rail service between LaGuardia and Midtown Manhattan.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration filed suit Wednesday to shut down California's emissions-trading market designed to limit air pollution, claiming the system is unconstitutional because it is run in cooperation with the Canadian province of Quebec.
The lawsuit contends that international pacts such as California's cap-and-trade program can be agreed to only by the federal government, or with its blessing.
"Defendants have intruded into the federal sphere," Justice Department lawyers wrote in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento, Calif.
Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and environmentalists criticized the suit, saying it appeared to be a politicized attack on climate policy and California in particular. A broad conflict has brewed between Washington and Sacramento -- on fronts including immigration, transportation and gun laws -- and environmental policy may be the most intense battleground.
"The White House is yet again continuing its political vendetta against California, our climate policies and the health of our communities," Mr. Newsom said. "The Trump administration's abysmal record of denying climate change and propping up big polluters makes cross-border collaboration all the more necessary."
The lawsuit is the latest assault by the Trump administration on California's environmental programs. In September, the administration moved to take away California's ability to set its own vehicle emissions standards, and then informed state leaders that their air-pollution plans may be incomplete or unworkable, putting billions of dollars in federal aid for the state at risk.

Full text: OTTAWA -- Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has ruled out any formal or informal coalition pact with rival parties to ensure his Liberal Party remains in power in a minority government.
The newly re-elected leader said on Wednesday he was prepared to work with other political parties on pressing issues related to climate change and alleviating households' financial stress. He plans to name a cabinet on Nov. 20 but didn't say when the new Parliament would be seated.
"I intend to sit down with all party leaders in the coming weeks to talk about their priorities, and how we can work together to respond to the preoccupations that Canadians have," he said in his first press conference since the Monday election. "But I can tell you it is not in our plans at all to form any sort of formal or informal coalition."
Mr. Trudeau said he accepted the verdict delivered by voters in Monday's election after his party fell below the 170-seat majority level. Mr. Trudeau's Liberal Party won 157 seats in the national legislature, versus 177 seats before the vote. The Conservative Party, led by Andrew Scheer, came in second place with 121 seats.
The Liberal Party will require support from other parties to get legislation passed and remain in power. By rejecting formal arrangements, like a power-sharing pact, Mr. Trudeau signaled he would craft legislation on a case-by-case basis to ensure it can get at least one other party on board to pass.
Support from either the Bloc Quebecois, with 32 seats, or the New Democratic Party, with 25 seats, would give Mr. Trudeau the votes to pass laws in the Canadian legislature. Both parties tend to share common interests with the Liberals on the environment and social policy. The NDP said during the election campaign it wouldn't back the Conservative Party because of its views on environment policy and Tory leader Mr. Scheer's conservative positions on abortion and same-sex marriage.
The election results "gave me a lot of food for thought," Mr. Trudeau said. "I have committed to think carefully and in-depth on the best way to move forward. I will be saying more about this as my thinking evolves."
On policy matters, the Canadian leader said an immediate government priority would be to cut taxes for middle-class families. During the campaign, Mr. Trudeau promised to deliver 5.6 billion Canadian dollars (US$4.2 billion) in tax relief to households by raising the amount of annual income exempt from tax, saying households were feeling pinched because rising costs and stagnant income growth.
Mr. Trudeau also said he would push ahead with the expansion of a pipeline to carry crude oil from landlocked Alberta to the Pacific Coast, destined for faster-growing markets in Asia.
Still, Mr. Trudeau was on the defensive on Wednesday about how his victory, with limited support from western Canada, has exacerbated a regional divide.
Government leaders in the resource-rich Western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan warned that their livelihoods were threatened by a Liberal minority government propped up by left-leaning parties that have championed efforts to scale back oil production.
No Liberal candidates won a legislative seat in either of those provinces, with four Liberal incumbents defeated; the party's share of the vote there substantially lagged behind the Conservatives.
"We need to work together, listen to each other and figure out the right path forward for every part of the country," said Mr. Trudeau, who during the election campaign vowed to fight efforts by "oil barons" to thwart tougher environmental policy.

Full text: To illustrate how Exxon Mobil Corp. allegedly deceived investors about its climate-change accounting, a lawyer from the New York attorney general's office showed a packed Manhattan courtroom Tuesday a multicolored world map the company presented to shareholders.
In red were countries including the U.S. and Canada where Exxon said it was planning for tougher climate-change regulation, showing the number the company used to calculate the higher cost.
"Investors were led to believe that Exxon applied the costs represented on the map," said Kevin Wallace, a lawyer from the New York attorney general's office.
In reality, Mr. Wallace said, Exxon didn't apply the costs.
The projected costs of climate-change regulation these colors represent are at the core of a case in which the state attorney general has accused the oil giant of defrauding investors. On Tuesday, the New York state court judge deciding the case heard opening statements in what is expected to be a three-week trial.
Last October, after a three-year investigation, the New York attorney general sued Exxon for securities fraud. The office said the oil giant told investors it used one formula to project future costs, but undisclosed internal guidance instructed staffers to make calculations using lower figures.
In his remarks, Theodore Wells, a lawyer representing Exxon from firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, called the attorney general's arguments sad, bizarre and twisted. "This is like no other securities-fraud case in the history of the country," he said.
Prosecutors brought the case under the Martin Act, a broad antifraud statute that has more commonly been used to investigate Wall Street. The attorney general's office said the company's misrepresentations caused investors to overvalue its stock, with the estimated damage to shareholders between $476 million and $1.6 billion.
Exxon has denied wrongdoing and said reasonable investors wouldn't expect to know such proprietary details.
In his opening statement, Mr. Wallace said the case is purely about whether the company deceived investors and whether those alleged deceptions mattered to how they valued Exxon as a public company. He presented investor materials and internal documents that he said showed how Exxon told investors one thing about climate-change accounting, while privately using different numbers.
The practice was approved at the top, Mr. Wallace said. One email, from an Exxon planning manager, referenced former Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson and the regulation formulas. "Rex has seemed happy with the difference previously," read the email from the manager. A spokeswoman for Mr. Tillerson didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Wells fired back that the company had for years acknowledged that climate change was real and that governments should address the issue. Exxon has sophisticated ways of calculating projected impacts, he said. In some cases, he said, the attorney general had oversimplified and conflated the way the company used different formulas.
Mr. Wells later brought up what he called the elephant in the room: politics. He said climate activists pushed state attorneys general, particularly former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who launched the Exxon investigation, to bring the case. A spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman declined to comment.

Full text: Exxon Mobil Corp. and New York's attorney general are headed for a showdown this week over accusations the company deceived investors, a rare trial over how the oil industry accounts for the impact of climate change.
The trial, which begins Tuesday in state court in Manhattan, is the culmination of a sprawling investigation into Exxon and its accounting practices that spanned four years and three New York attorneys general. It is expected to include as a witness former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was Exxon's chief executive from 2006 to 2016.
The attorney general's office said Exxon told investors that it was taking into account the future costs of regulations it expected governments to adopt in response to climate change. But Exxon's internal calculations didn't match its public representations, the office said, causing investors to overvalue its stock. It estimated the damage to shareholders to be between $476 million and $1.6 billion.
Exxon has denied wrongdoing and said a reasonable investor wouldn't expect to know such internal details. The company also has accused the attorneys general involved, all Democrats, of being motivated by politics in bringing the case, which the office has denied.
The oil industry has said that it is difficult to estimate the costs of climate-change regulation, which is uncertain politically and varies across national boundaries, as investors have demanded more information.
A verdict in the attorney general's favor could bolster federal lawsuits filed by shareholders in Texas and New Jersey that make similar allegations, which Exxon has also denied. It could also spur future investigations.
"It could open up a big can of worms," said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst at financial-services firm Edward Jones. "Other companies could be looked at and questioned about what assumptions they have made."
A win for Exxon could insulate the company from similar suits and would represent another blow for climate-change lawsuits. Federal judges have recently tossed other climate-change cases, including when New York, San Francisco and other cities sued oil companies to recoup costs incurred from the effects of rising global temperatures.
Tuesday's proceedings mark only the second trial of a case where climate change is a central issue in U.S. history, said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. In 2007, he said, a federal judge upheld a Vermont regulation on emissions standards that auto makers and dealers had challenged.
The New York attorney general's office sued Exxon last October, saying its climate-change disclosure methods were "sanctioned at the highest levels of the company."
Prosecutors said Mr. Tillerson was aware of misrepresentations to investors. A spokeswoman for Mr. Tillerson referred a request for comment to Exxon. An Exxon spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment.
In a deposition, Mr. Tillerson referred to differing calculations as an "academic debate."

Full text: PALERMO, Italy -- For Rosalino Palazzolo, growing coffee is a dream. After growing all manner of produce on his Sicily farm, the third-generation farmer harvested his first coffee crop this year.
Mr. Palazzolo is still experimenting, but his goal is to produce the first commercial coffee grown in Italy -- a nation well-known for roasting coffee beans but not growing the tropical plant from which they come.
Growing coffee in Sicily may have been impossible a few decades ago. Coffee has traditionally grown only in the so-called bean belt, in the tropics stretching from Central America to Africa to Asia. But rising temperatures are making parts of the bean belt too hot for coffee, and other regions suitable for the crop.
By 2050, climate change could decrease the area in the tropics suitable for growing coffee by as much as 50%, according to the Climate Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on climate change.
Farmers outside of traditional coffee-growing regions, in places like California, Australia and Saudi Arabia, already are experimenting with the crop. Within the bean belt, some coffee farmers are moving to higher elevations in search of cooler air, says Aaron Davis, a scientist at the U.K.'s Royal Botanic Gardens who studies global coffee growth.
But not everyone thinks those efforts will be sustainable, so researchers also are working on another solution: breeding new coffee varieties that can better tolerate the changing climate conditions in the bean belt.
Coffee grown outside of traditional areas can be high quality, tasting experts say, but it also brings new challenges, including weather risks such as frost.
"Coffee is a very picky plant," says Stacy Philpott, a professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. It needs a lot of water and just the right amount of sun. It's very sensitive to frost or natural disasters such as hurricanes.
And it's expensive. Growing coffee outside of the rain-heavy tropics requires cost-intensive irrigation. In developed countries, labor costs are so high that the coffee beans they produce becomes a luxury product.
Frinj Coffee, in Santa Barbara County, Calif., pays farmworkers at least $15 an hour. (The minimum wage for agricultural work in Guatemala is roughly $12 a day.) Last year Frinj coffee sold for $16 a cup in Blue Bottle Coffee shops. "I saw an audience that was looking for a unique-tasting coffee and was willing to pay for it," says Frinj Coffee co-founder and chief executive Jay Ruskey, a farmer with 30 years' experience who began selling coffee in 2013. He expects California coffee to remain popular as a high-end product for connoisseurs.
Although 42 private farms in Southern California are now growing beans for Frinj, scientists such as Dr. Philpott say growing coffee in California might not be sustainable because it requires so much irrigation.
"As the climate changes, you can either move the farm or you can change the plant. It's easier to change the plant," says Hanna Neuschwander, communications director at World Coffee Research, a nonprofit research group that is coordinating scientists' efforts to engineer hardier coffee varieties.
Experts are working to map the coffee genome, identifying and isolating the individual genes that make up the world's 124 known species of coffee. They aim to identify genes linked to heat- or disease-resistance, then crossbreed species to produce plants with these features.
Last year coffee leaf rust, a fungus caused by unusually high temperatures and high-altitude rains, devastated the coffee crop in Central America, affecting 70% of farms, according to World Coffee Research. When the next epidemic hits, experts hope to have a variety that will get a sniffly cold instead of pneumonia.
Still, developing these varieties might take decades. Getting them into the fields of coffee farmers -- who typically replant every 20 to 30 years -- might take even longer.
Adding to the challenge, scientists will have to outrun threats of species extinction. Commercial coffee production focuses on two varieties: arabica, used in high-end specialty coffee, and robusta, a less expensive bean used in instant coffee or mixtures with arabica. The other types are uncultivated strains growing in forests around the world, and scientists often turn to them to find heat- or disease-tolerant genes. With deforestation, however, those uncultivated varieties have come under threat: 75 are at risk of extinction, according to Dr. Davis.
"We're losing a reservoir of potential genes that could prevent disasters, farmer losses and other things," says Timothy Schilling, founder and former CEO of World Coffee Research.

Full text: With the threat of tariffs on iPhones approaching in August, Apple Inc. stood to lose billions of dollars in profit. Chief Executive Tim Cook reached out to one of his most important contacts in Washington, Jared Kushner.
Mr. Kushner arranged a call between Mr. Cook and his father-in-law, President Trump, people familiar with the call said, giving the Apple chief a chance to explain how tariffs would increase iPhone prices and impair Apple's ability to compete against rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co.
Within days, the Trump administration scaled back its tariff plan to exempt a swath of electronics products, including iPhones, saying it wanted to protect consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season. The call from Mr. Cook influenced the decision, a person close to the administration said.
A day after that move, Apple issued a press release trumpeting job growth, saying that since 2011 it had quadrupled the number of jobs its business supports in the U.S. Later, Mr. Trump publicly praised Mr. Cook's power of persuasion, saying the CEO had made a compelling argument about tariffs.
The events encapsulated Mr. Cook's diplomacy in the Trump era. To protect his company's interests, people close to the company and administration said, the Apple CEO has cultivated a relationship with the president and his family, an unlikely alliance given their contrasting personalities and divergent views on many issues.
The rapport between Mr. Cook, a Hillary Clinton supporter in 2016 who fashioned Apple's outsourcing strategy, and Mr. Trump, a Republican who campaigned against Apple's China-based manufacturing, has served each man's interests in such areas as trade and tax reform, even as they remain divided over immigration and climate change.
The nascent impeachment inquiry is unlikely to have an immediate effect on the relationship, according to people close to Apple. Mr. Cook is expected to continue to engage on issues related to the company's business while steering clear of politics and pushing back on social issues.
Mr. Cook serves as an adviser to the administration's workforce policy board, and the two have dined together the past two summers at Mr. Trump's golf club in Bedminster, N.J. Mr. Trump refers to the Apple CEO as a friend and lauds his business chops. He has called Mr. Cook to wish him a Happy Thanksgiving, a person familiar with the matter said.
"He's a great executive," Mr. Trump said recently. "Others go out and hire very expensive consultants. Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly."
Mr. Trump has spent more of his working time than predecessors with corporate leaders, said presidential historian Jeremi Suri, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He said those relationships tend to focus more on administration priorities such as trade and tariffs than the broader economy, a focal point of past administrations.
Mr. Cook is one of the few executives in a hyperpolarized political era who has managed to both support and challenge the president's agenda in a way that has kept him in Mr. Trump's good graces while avoiding any public backlash from either employees or customers.
Such engagement has proved risky for other chief executives. Facing public pressure, Under Armour Inc.'s Kevin Plank, Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk and Uber Technologies Inc.'s Travis Kalanick resigned from presidential advisory councils over disagreements with the administration. A similar resignation by Merck & Co. CEO Kenneth Frazier, who publicly criticized the president's handling of violence in Charlottesville, Va., led Mr. Trump to unleash a barrage of tweets castigating the drugmaker for high prices.
"There are only a handful [of executives] who have been able to thread the needle," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale University management professor who has informally advised Mr. Trump over the years before he became president. "This is a newfound capability for Apple. Steve Jobs didn't have influence in Washington, and Tim Cook has offered it." He added that Mr. Trump's volatility means the relationship with Mr. Cook could change, but that was unlikely in the near term.
Apple declined to make Mr. Cook available for an interview. The White House said Mr. Trump declined to comment. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.)
Mr. Cook's personal diplomacy stands out among tech giants. Others have sharply increased their outlays on lobbying in recent years but haven't forged close ties to the administration. Apple's $18 million in lobbying since 2017 is half of what either Amazon.com Inc. or Google's Alphabet Inc. have spent, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Mr. Cook fostered close ties with Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, giving him a backchannel to the White House. He also meets regularly with administration officials such as economic adviser Larry Kudlow. Despite his personal preference for privacy, he has attended publicly promoted dinners and meetings with Mr. Trump, said people close to Apple and the administration.
Nearly 97% of Apple employee donations to candidates in the 2018 midterm elections went to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, citing public disclosures. Yet employees haven't publicly criticized Mr. Cook for engaging with the president. Mr. Cook has challenged the president on some social issues. His personal lobbying benefited the company on the tariff issue, and tax changes that led to employee bonuses.
At a March meeting, President Trump introduced Mr. Cook as "Tim Apple" -- a mistake that ricocheted across social media. Trump supporters laughed, while critics painted it as yet another presidential gaffe. Mr. Cook responded by updating his name on Twitter to use the Apple logo in place of his last name. Presidential supporters read it as an inside joke between the two leaders, while opponents interpreted it as a jab at the president.
"There are a lot of folks in Silicon Valley who reek of disdainfulness for politics," said Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), who regularly meets with Mr. Cook. "They often presume they're much smarter than anyone in policy. . . . Tim doesn't have that approach. He actually listens."
Mr. Cook grew up outside Mobile, Ala., the son of a shipyard worker, and earned an engineering degree at Auburn University and an M.B.A. from Duke. He is an operations wizard, skilled at minimizing costs. In his previous role at Apple, he shifted production from the U.S. to China, and helped build a business there that accounts for one-fifth of Apple's revenue.
Mr. Trump was elected president after promising to rebuild American manufacturing and place tariffs on Chinese goods. "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers in this country instead of other countries," he said during a 2016 campaign speech.
The month after his election, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Cook to meet in New York. Apple executives debated skipping the summit, worried Mr. Trump would air grievances about manufacturing and Apple's commitment to encrypted iPhones, according to a person familiar with the company. But people who knew Mr. Trump encouraged Mr. Cook to attend, this person said.
Mr. Trump was friendly and charming, said people familiar with the meeting. He told Mr. Cook he looked forward to working together and encouraged the CEO to contact Mr. Kushner with any issues.
Mr. Cook spoke about Apple's manufacturing practices, drawing a contrast between smartphone production and automobile manufacturing, according to these people. Most of the value in the iPhone came from the design and engineering, he said, and the Chinese workers who did the assembly received low wages, so how could those jobs be good for U.S. workers?
He told Mr. Trump that a trade war with China would be a big problem for major American companies such as Apple.
Messrs. Trump and Kushner appreciated Mr. Cook's approach, and felt he was someone they could work with, a former senior administration official said.
Mr. Cook came away from the meeting with a sense that Mr. Trump listened and that they could work together, one of the people familiar with the company said. When Mr. Cook was in Washington the following month, he had dinner with Mr. Kushner and his wife at Ristorante Tosca.
Their early rapport was tested a month later when Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending entry to the U.S. from several Muslim-majority nations. The order disrupted airports and triggered protests at Google, where thousands of people staged a walkout.
Mr. Cook, an immigration advocate, was surprised. Apple later told the administration it disapproved of the measure. Mr. Cook emailed Apple employees, saying he made clear to officials in Washington that the company and nation wouldn't exist without immigration.
His ties to the White House, though, remained intact. A few months later, current and former administration officials said, Ms. Trump called on Mr. Cook for help: Would he speak to her father about his plan to exit from the Paris Climate Accord?
Mr. Cook's appeal to preserve the U.S. commitment to the climate agreement didn't succeed, these people said, but it allowed him to convey his feelings to the president directly before sending an email to employees that criticized exiting the climate agreement.
Mr. Cook has said he relies on a simple formula before weighing in, asking himself: Does Apple have a right to talk about this? Do we have standing? He speaks out about education, privacy, human rights, immigration and the environment. "I don't think business should only deal in commercial things," he said at a conference last year.
Before challenging Mr. Trump's policies publicly, though, often he or a member of Apple's public-affairs team alerts the White House through Mr. Kushner or other senior White House officials, former administration officials said.
At other times, Mr. Cook holds his tongue. When the president told the Journal in July 2017 that Mr. Cook promised to build "three big plants, beautiful plants" in the U.S., the company declined to comment, pointing to past statements about its reliance on U.S. suppliers for components.
While Mr. Cook had spoken with the president about manufacturing around that time, the CEO hadn't discussed three plants in the U.S., a person familiar with the company said. The CEO didn't challenge Mr. Trump because "it would have been a tweet war," the Journal reported last year, citing another person familiar with the company.
"In being measured and thoughtful, he doesn't create crisis when there doesn't need to be one, or antagonism when there doesn't need to be any," one of the former administration officials said of Mr. Cook.
When Mr. Trump began working toward a planned tax cut in 2017, Mr. Cook told the president that Apple would invest more in the U.S. if it could bring its $250 billion in overseas cash back to the U.S. at a lower tax rate, one of the former administration officials said. Mr. Trump later cited Mr. Cook and Apple as he promoted a tax overhaul, this person added.
In early 2018, less than a month after the tax bill was signed, Apple announced it would contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over five years -- a figure that included spending on parts and services, capital spending and tax payments. Even though that was consistent with Apple's previous spending levels in the U.S., Mr. Cook went on ABC News to tout the commitment, as well as Apple's promise to develop a new Apple campus, which it later awarded to Austin, Texas.
Mr. Trump praised Apple later in January during the State of the Union address, saying its spending was an example of the benefits of tax cuts.
Over time, the administration began to rely on Mr. Cook for insight into trade and business issues around the world, including in China, Brazil and Europe, former and current senior administration officials said.
Trade remained a major sticking point. Mr. Cook told Mr. Trump regularly that a trade war would harm U.S. companies. Mr. Trump often told Mr. Cook he wanted Apple to add jobs in the U.S.
To ward off criticism of its overseas manufacturing, Apple rebranded commitments to U.S. manufacturing as spending from an "Advanced Manufacturing Fund" program, one of the people close to the company said. Previously, similar spending commitments with suppliers weren't publicized.
Early this year, Mr. Cook joined the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board led by Ms. Trump. The group, which includes the CEOs of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Siemens USA, aims to help U.S. employers and the government better train workers.
Last year, when the White House announced duties on $200 billion of Chinese-made goods, it exempted a group of products including Apple's smartwatch and wireless earbuds. But the tariff threat re-emerged in May when Mr. Trump threatened tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese goods. The tariffs would have increased the price of new iPhones, on average, by about $40, and reduced Apple's per-share earnings by more than 20%, according to analysts.
Despite the tariff threat, Apple made plans to manufacture a new version of its Mac Pro in China. The current version of the computer was produced in Austin, Texas.
After the president said in August he planned to move forward with the tariffs, Mr. Cook reached out to Mr. Kushner, who set up the phone call with the president that helped persuade the Trump administration to spare iPhones and other products from tariffs.
The president later said Mr. Cook made the case that tariffs would give Samsung an advantage over Apple because the South Korean company wouldn't have to pay duties.
The plea clicked with Mr. Trump, according to former senior administration officials. He wants to stop countries such as China from competing unfairly against the U.S., and for American multinationals to succeed world-wide.
Several weeks later, Apple reversed its plan for the Mac Pro, announcing it would continue to make it in Austin, after the administration granted exclusions on tariffs for some Chinese-made components in the desktop computer.
"The reason I speak to Tim Cook: He's the one that calls me," Mr. Trump said in August.

Full text: KURT VOLKER'S BUSY WEEK: The recently resigned State Department special envoy for Ukraine met privately with House investigators Thursday to discuss whether President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president into investigating Joe Biden. It's a life-changing few days for Volker: He's getting married this weekend.
Volker's fiancee, Ia Meurmishvili, is herself quite familiar with Eastern European geopolitics: She covers Georgian news for Voice of America. Volker will have plenty of time for a honeymoon following his resignation from the State Department, though he remains employed by the John McCain Institute at Arizona State University for now and by the heavyweight consultancy BGR Group.
Meurmishvili attended McCain's funeral in September 2018, where she posed for a photo with Biden that she posted on Instagram.
CORPORATIONS PUSH BACK on the Trump administration's attempt to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Amazon, IBM and about 140 other major companies say in a Supreme Court amicus brief filed Friday that ending the policy would inflict serious harm on U.S. companies and their workers. They estimate the cost to GDP of ending protections for immigrants who arrived illegally as children at $460.3 billion over the next decade.
The filing follows a separate one submitted by Apple this week, and Microsoft is a litigant in the case. They claim that the Department of Homeland Security's legal determination is faulty and that it lacks the authority to override Congress's recognition of DACA. The Trump administration says the program isn't authorized by immigration statutes. The Supreme Court will hear a case on DACA's legality this term.
WORDSMITH WANTED: The Federal Reserve seeks a speechwriter for one of the most heavily parsed policy makers on the planet. Chairman Jerome Powell has faced his share of communications challenges during a tenure marked by skittish markets, a slowing economy and constant attacks by President Trump. The Fed posted the job, which is a new position, last month and has hired an outside consultant to help identify candidates.
The speechwriter is unlikely to help with Powell's occasional off-the-cuff remarks that have roiled markets. And it might not help with the nation's foremost Fed critic either: Trump has criticized Powell's decisions no matter how they're delivered.
SAUDI ARABIA ramps up its Washington lobbying in the year since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The kingdom spent more than $27 million on its influence efforts over the past year, around $11 million more than the previous year, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The majority of the money went to the public relations firm Qorvis MSLGroup.
Other recipients of the largess include a firm run by former Republican congressman and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, while some Washington firms, including Glover Park Group, stopped working with the kingdom because of intense public pressure and unfavorable press.
SENATE DEMOCRATS' shadow climate committee continues its work with an eye on being in the majority in 2021. Chuck Schumer, Brian Schatz, Sheldon Whitehouse and other senators met with financial-sector executives, including the chief executives of S&P Global and Moody's in New York last week to press them on climate-related financial disclosures. Next up, a hearing later this month on the fossil fuel industry's use of dark money to support climate change opponents in Congress. Democrats would need to take all three Republican seats currently labeled tossups by the Cook Political Report, plus one more, to take the Senate.
REPUBLICAN VIEWS of the FBI become more positive after a low point last year. A new Pew Research Center poll shows that 66% of Republicans now have a positive view of the bureau, up 17 percentage points since July 2018. Democrats' approval of the FBI has stayed steadier, with around three-quarters of respondents holding favorable views of the agency.
ON THE BENCH: Justice Brett Kavanaugh and family were spotted at Nationals Park on Tuesday as the hometown team downed Milwaukee's Brewers, 4-3. The rookie justice has attended all 12 home playoff games in Nationals history, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017 and this year. Kavanaugh himself will be back on the bench Monday, when the 2019 Supreme Court term opens.
MINOR MEMOS: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky takes a break from geopolitics to meet with Tom Cruise; dubs him "good looking" . . . Amy Klobuchar says she killed a duck with an errant tee shot the one time she went golfing . . . Spotted at a cooking class in Provence, France, last week as the impeachment inquiry into President Trump was announced: H.R. McMaster, the second of Trump's four first-term national-security advisers.

Full text: Kristalina Georgieva took the helm of the International Monetary Fund this week as its first leader to have lived through one of its stringenteconomic adjustment programs.
Her homeland of Bulgaria was going through a painful transition from socialism to a market economy in the 1990s, with surging debt and unemployment, a collapsing financial system and high inflation.
Ms. Georgieva said it was the experience of seeing people faced with food shortages and widespread poverty caused by bad policies that fortified her commitment to economic rigor.
The IMF helped Bulgaria's economy by providing essential loans in exchange for difficult policy reforms including shrinking the public sector, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and abandoning state subsidies.
Ms. Georgieva said this experience drove her to pursue a career in international institutions such as the World Bank and the European Commission because she strongly believes they can improve the lives of ordinary people. She is now determined to demonstrate this at the IMF.
"At a time when there is more skepticism about our work, the very best way for multilateral organizations to prove that multilateralism works is by delivering," Ms. Georgieva said from her office on Tuesday in the first interview after she started the job.
The economist spent most of Tuesday poring over current IMF loan programs to determine whether they need adjustment as economic growth slows.
"We recognize that the global economy continues to disappoint. The unpredictability of trade disputes, capital flow volatility, Brexit and conflict and natural disasters are able to cause massive economic disruptions," Ms. Georgieva said.
She noted the recent attack on Saudi oil facilities and following spike in oil prices as an example of the dangerous volatility threatening the world.
And she warns countries to act now and make growth-spurring public investments or structural changes before conditions weaken further.
"Christine Lagarde would say when the sun is shining is the time to fix the roof," Ms. Georgieva said of her predecessor. "I'm coming when there are clouds and occasional raindrops and my message is there's no more possibility to delay fixing the roof."
Ms. Georgieva said the IMF under her leadership will focus more on issues of inequality, corruption, and the climate, as well as the effects of rapid technological change.
She wrote her Ph.D. thesis on U.S. environmental protection policy and now co-chairs a high-level initiative for climate-change policies together with Ban Ki-moon, the former head of the United Nations, and Bill Gates, the tech-billionaire-turned-philanthropist. She bought an electric car out of concern about climate change, which she has witnessed firsthand in her work in Africa and elsewhere.
A descendant of Bulgarian revolutionaries who won independence from Ottoman rule, Ms. Georgieva in her first job sold groceries at a market during economic hardship. She only obtained a bank account in her early 30s, when she moved to Britain to work at the London School of Economics.
Today, she drives her red Tesla to work, blasting out rock music before key meetings. Ms. Georgieva manages her own social media; she has posted videos of herself in T-shirts and sweatpants at the World Bank, leading a flash mob on International Women's Day, and yoga sessions with her employees as part of her policy of improving well-being in the workplace.
Former colleagues say her leadership style inspires loyalty, but she can also be tough and direct.
Ms. Georgieva once repelled a bid by senior European Union colleagues to appropriate part of her portfolio by publicly declaring in a speech that it could happen only "over my dead body."
"She wouldn't be pushed around," said Jonathan Hill, a member of Britain's House of Lords who worked with her at the EU's executive body.
Detractors say Ms. Georgieva, who has never held elected office, lacks political gravitas. But Robert Zoellick, the former president of the World Bank, said she brings to the Fund the experience of a deal-making technocratwho is at home in the top echelons of global politics. "Kristalina has the skills, breadth of experience, global network, intelligence, and personal touch to become a highly successful leader of the IMF at a challenging and important time."

Full text: Facebook Inc. plans to exempt opinion pieces and satire from its fact-checking program, according to people familiar with the matter, as the social-media giant grapples with how to stop the spread of falsehoods while maintaining its own neutrality.
As part of the new rules, Facebook will allow publishers of information found to be false by outside fact checkers to appeal to the company, said the people familiar with the changes. Posts that Facebook deems to be either opinion or satire won't be labeled as false even if they contain information the fact checkers determined was inaccurate, the people said.
The new rules follow Facebook's acknowledgment last week that it will continue exempting politicians from fact-checks on the grounds that such comments are newsworthy, as well as a recent controversy arising from a third-party fact checker's determination that an antiabortion group's video was false.
The rules, which haven't been announced, coincide with Facebook's decision last week to remove a false designation from a Washington Examiner opinion piece, overriding the conclusion of one of its fact-check partners. That op-ed argued that global-warming climate models have been inaccurate and that the risks of climate change are overblown.
The removal of the false label was celebrated by the CO2 Coalition, which employs the op-ed's authors and had argued in a letter to Facebook that the company "used a partisan fact-check group to defame them." The group, which receives funding from the oil-and-gas industry, dismisses global warming as a hoax and advocates for the "important contribution made by carbon dioxide to our lives and the economy."
A Facebook spokeswoman didn't respond to requests for comment on the new rules.
Together, the changes demonstrate the company's continuing struggle to limit the spread of so-called fake news and other misinformation without being accused of stifling free speech.
"I know Facebook doesn't want to be in the middle of this, but here they are," said Angie Drobnic Holan, the editor of PolitiFact and a member of the board of the International Fact-Checking Network, which accredits Facebook's fact-checking partners.
Ms. Holan said she expected that the changes as described would only affect the overall fact-checking program at the margins, but noted that publishers of false statements have a history of arguing that they are opinions.
"There are cases where the line between fact and opinion are not as bright as you might think," she said.
Other fact checkers have noted similarly slippery boundaries between fact and satire.
Rappler, a Manila-based news outlet that fact-checks Facebook content in the Philippines, has documented bad-faith publishers dressing up false stories as satire. If such a dodge is allowed, Rappler wrote last year, "purveyors of fake news will now be able to escape accountability by simply labeling their stories as satire, no matter the intention, how badly written they are, how many clues they use to overrationalize, or even if they disregard every rule of satire."
Facebook's fact-checking program has become a central piece of the company's response to misinformation since its unveiling in late 2016.
Fact-checking groups choose what content to review, and material deemed false or partially false carries a warning and is distributed by Facebook's algorithms to fewer people.
The program is limited to just over 50 groups world-wide, many of which receive funding from Facebook.
The recent controversy over the fact-checking of antiabortion organization Live Action illustrates the stakes. In a video distributed on Facebook, Live Action said that abortion is never medically necessary.
Science Feedback, a French nonprofit that was approved as a Facebook fact-checking partner earlier this year, labeled the claim false. Though Science Feedback's conclusion was in line with medical literature and the primary professional association for obstetricians and gynecologists, Live Action alleged that the doctors who had consulted on the fact check were biased by their affiliation with abortion-rights organizations.
Live Action accused Facebook of suppressing debate, and the complaint was widely circulated in conservative media and eventually drew the support of Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley.
Facebook removed the false designation from Live Action's video, pending an investigation by the International Fact-Checking Network about whether Science Feedback's actions were appropriate. On Friday, the IFCN said it stood by Science Feedback's process and determination.
As of Monday afternoon, Facebook hadn't restored the designation of Live Action's video as false. The company didn't respond to questions about whether the statement that abortion is never medically necessary might be classified as opinion.
A Live Action representative didn't respond to a request for comment.
Facebook's fact-checking program has been panned by critics, and some partners have reported frustration over the limited tools provided to them.
Yet both fact checkers and the company have of late said the program is improving. "I really appreciate that Facebook works with us to help find hoax content," said Ms. Holan.

Full text: The California Institute of Technology announced its largest-ever gift Thursday, a $750 million pledge from the family that owns Wonderful Co. aimed at enhancing and scaling research on environmental sustainability.
The gift, the second-largest yet to a U.S. academic institution, will create a permanent endowment to fund studies across the Pasadena, Calif., school and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech manages for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It will also support the building of a new facility that will serve as a hub for interdisciplinary research on topics including solar power, plastics, ecology and biosphere engineering.
The funds will "permit Caltech to tackle issues of water, energy, food, and waste in a world confronting rapid climate change," said President Thomas F. Rosenbaum. All first-year students at Caltech will now rotate through new undergraduate teaching labs, and the core curriculum will be redesigned to incorporate sustainability and engineering material.
The donation comes from Stewart Resnick and Lynda Resnick, whose company owns Fiji Water, Wonderful Pistachios and other brands. Mr. Resnick is a senior member of the Caltech board of trustees.
The donation illustrates a new era of megagifts, dwarfing the total endowments of many U.S. colleges and universities. Last year, seven schools received donations topping $100 million.
The largest gift yet to a U.S. school was announced in November, $1.8 billion given to Johns Hopkins University by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, targeting financial aid.
"In order to comprehensively manage the climate crisis, we need breakthrough innovations, the kind that will only be possible through significant investment in university research," Mr. Resnick said.

Full text: A scientific panel under the auspices of the United Nations has concluded after reviewing thousands of research studies that oceans are warming and ice sheets are shrinking because of heat-trapping greenhouse-gas emissions.
A report released on Wednesday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sums up existing research on global warming to provide a technical baseline for governments taking action to fight climate change.
The U.S. was among 195 countries that approved the report, which was released as world leaders meet at the U.N. for the General Assembly.
The U.N. held a climate-change summit on Monday to spur governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In the report, the panel said the oceans have absorbed enough excess carbon dioxide in recent decades to make seawater more acidic and hold less oxygen, which affects sea life, while freshwater from melting ice sheets has become a significant cause of rising sea levels.
The result, the panel said, is disrupting global fisheries and threatening the 680 million people who live in low-lying coastal communities with higher tides, flooding and storm surges.
"There are choices about how things like sea level rise, ocean warming and ocean acidification will play out," said oceanographer Michael Meredith at the British Antarctic Survey, an independent but government-funded agency, who was a lead author of the report. "The hope is that policy makers will take the science here and use it to make the best possible decisions to address these challenges."
The report comes as evidence mounts that the Earth is warming. Since the 1880s, the average global surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius), according to scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. The past five years are, collectively, the warmest years in the modern record, they said earlier this year.
Much scientific work attributes global warming to man-made emissions, though some dispute a connection.
The panel, known by the initials IPCC, is a group of scientists convened by the U.N. to review scientific, economic and other data on climate change and issue a technical baseline that policy makers can draw upon.
The panel members reviewed scientific studies as well as research from governments and industry.
Last October, the panel urged governments to step up efforts, including meeting voluntary carbon-reduction goals laid out in the 2015 Paris climate accord, to avoid the destruction of ecosystems and rising sea levels that would lead to flooding. The Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the accord.
The new report, called the "Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate," was prepared by more than 100 scientists from more than 30 countries who assessed about 7,000 studies concerning the effect of climate change on the oceans and global ice sheets, assuming carbon emissions continue at the current pace.
As the atmosphere has warmed over recent decades, the oceans have absorbed heat unevenly, creating patches with unusually warm sea temperatures that can encompass thousands of square miles and persist for months, affecting fisheries, wildlife and weather patterns, the U.N. panel scientists said.
Since 2003, vast pools of water up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit or so above normal have been detected repeatedly in the Pacific around Australia, in the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic off New England, the scientists said.
Between 2006 and 2015, the Greenland Ice Sheet lost ice at an average rate of about 278 billion tons every year, while ice sheets in Antarctica during the same period melted at a rate of about 155 billion tons every year, the U.N. panel said.

Full text: UNITED NATIONS -- World leaders pledged to do more to combat climate change Monday at a United Nations summit, but they were reprimanded by teenage activist Greta Thunberg, who accused them of "empty words."
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the audience at the one-day summit that his country would increase renewable-energy capacity, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently unveiled new climate policies, said her country aimed to become carbon neutral by midcentury and phase out coal by 2038.
"We believe that an ounce of practice is worth more than a ton of preaching," said Mr. Modi.
But Ms. Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who raised awareness about reducing carbon footprints by sailing across the Atlantic in a racing yacht, said world leaders weren't doing enough.
"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, and yet I am one of the lucky ones," she said at the summit. "People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing."
The summit, which followed youth climate strikes world-wide Friday, sought to generate momentum around meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris accord. The pact seeks to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.
The average temperature already is 1.1 degrees Celsius above those levels, according to World Meteorological Organization estimates.
The U.S., which has vowed to leave the climate pact, wasn't scheduled to take the stage Monday, but President Trump attended presentations by Mr. Modi and Ms. Merkel before leaving to speak at a separate U.N. event about religious freedom.
About a mile away from the U.N., the chief executives of the world's largest oil companies discussed how they can work to address climate change, a growing concern among investors, even as they seek to satisfy rising energy demand.
The companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC, said that they are on track to collectively cut average emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, to less than 0.25% of gas sold by 2025.
"Very soon, nobody's going to be able to hide methane leakage," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said, referring to technology such as drones that detect methane releases.

Full text: SAN FRANCISCO -- Former California Gov. Jerry Brown revealed a new project on Monday: a joint institute with China dedicated to combating climate change.
Mr. Brown said he was starting the California-China Climate Institute at the University of California at Berkeley in partnership with China's chief negotiator at the 2015 Paris agreement, Xie Zhenhua.
The institute will foster joint research and training between scientists in China and the U.S. and could help push both countries to adopt lower emissions of greenhouse gases, Mr. Brown said.
"California can keep the spotlight on what needs to be done; working in partnership with China makes it more powerful," Mr. Brown said.
The institute will seek to advance research on everything from zero-emission vehicles to agricultural techniques that emit fewer greenhouse gases.
As governor, Mr. Brown urged other states to pursue their own climate standards. He also struck several climate agreements with various heads of state around the globe to reduce emissions.
California has maintained its defiant role toward federal climate policies since Mr. Brown left the governorship.
On Monday, Mr. Brown's successor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, delivered opening remarks at Climate Week NYC.

Full text: Big oil companies aim to show investors and government officials that they are part of the solution to a problem they helped cause as global leaders prepare to debate action on climate change.
World leaders will convene at the U.N. on Monday to chart their paths to meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris accord, which seeks to limit global temperature increases. But much of the action is expected to happen on the sidelines and at events hosted by industry and investor groups, where oil-and-gas companies will make the case that they remain sound investments.
Companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC and Chevron Corp. disagree on how to do so, but they have to try: Their shareholders are demanding it.
"One of the top risks today is climate change," said Michael Rubio, Chevron's general manager over environmental, social and governance issues. "Engagements have increased, and investors are expecting us to voluntarily disclose how we're managing the climate-related risks and opportunities."
Fossil-fuel companies are falling out of favor with investors over underwhelming returns and fears that their long-term prospects are uncertain. Electric vehicles and renewable energy are gaining traction as governments adopt tougher regulations on greenhouse-gas emissions. The oil-and-gas sector now makes up 4% of the S&P 500 index, down from 10% a decade ago, FactSet data show. Exxon recently fell out of the S&P 500's top 10 companies for the first time in years.
The world's largest oil-and-gas producers are in general agreement on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from their drilling sites, pipelines and other operations. The companies have set targets to curb releases of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. They have also discussed initiatives tied to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reducing emissions from industries such as shipping, according to people familiar with the matter.
But there is friction among some companies over whether to commit to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from the oil byproducts they sell, such as gasoline. Shell was among the first of the major oil companies to agree to cut those emissions, a decision that initially angered some members of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, an industry consortium.
Companies including Total SA and Repsol SA also have set targets to reduce the carbon intensity of their products. Companies that have pushed back argue that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for oil companies to realistically control such goals. Exxon, Chevron and BP are among those concerned about setting such emission goals, the people said.

Full text: Hundreds of thousands of students from across the globe took the lead during a day of climate protests before next week's United Nations summit on climate change.
"We deserve a safe future and we demand a safe future," said Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish activist who recently raised awareness about reducing carbon footprints by sailing across the Atlantic in a racing yacht.
"Is that really too much to ask?" she told a packed crowd of schoolchildren, their parents and demonstrators in New York before addressing next week's climate conference at the United Nations.
Organizers said 800 events were planned across the U.S., including Washington, D.C., Chicago and Los Angeles, capping off a day of rallies across the globe from Sydney to Kabul to Berlin to Istanbul. Many centered on specific goals, including stopping approvals for new mining or drilling projects and switching entirely to renewable sources of energy by 2030.
In the Solomon Islands, protests sprang up over rising sea levels. Hundreds of schoolchildren in Thailand burst into the headquarters of the environment ministry in Bangkok and then lay down to mimic their own extinction.
In Germany, police in cities such as Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich warned that central areas would be shut down as tens of thousands of people joined the rallies, including one in front of the office of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
In Australia, about 300,000 people took part in a series of rallies. Many of the attendees held placards with slogans such as "There is No Planet B."

Full text: Amazon.com Inc. plans to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles as it seeks to reduce its carbon emissions in the face of criticism of its environmental impact.
The order was part of a broader company pledge made by Chief Executive Jeff Bezos while speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. He said the company plans to be carbon-neutral by 2040 and plans to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement 10 years earlier than the 2050 target.
The e-commerce giant is ordering the electric vehicles from the suburban Detroit-based startup Rivian Automotive. Amazon said the vehicles will start delivering packages to customers in 2021. The company plans to have 10,000 of the new electric vehicles on the road as early as 2022, and all 100,000 by 2030.
Amazon led a $700 million financing round in the electric-vehicle startup earlier this year. Rivian recently landed a $350 million investment from Cox Automotive, bringing its valuation to about $3.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.
Amazon has built up its delivery fleet in recent years and has become a force in the shipping industry, although it still works with companies such as United Parcel Service Inc. FedEx Corp. recently ended its two major shipping contracts with Amazon.
Mr. Bezos said Thursday that the commitments are part of a new climate pledge that promises Amazon will report greenhouse-gas emissions regularly and implement strategies to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. A company being carbon-neutral means having no net release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by either offsetting emissions through actions such as planting trees or by eliminating emissions altogether.
Amazon said it expects 80% of its energy use to come from renewable sources by 2024, up from 40% now. It is working toward its facilities being 100%-powered using renewable energy by 2030, helped in part by wind and solar projects. "We've decided to use our size and scale to make a difference," Mr. Bezos said in a written statement, while calling on other large companies to sign the pledge.
Amazon's climate pledge comes one day before more than 1,550 Amazon employees threatened to walk out of work if the company didn't do more to fight climate change. The employees had pressed the company to have zero carbon emissions by 2030, stop providing its cloud-computing services to fossil-fuel companies and to end donations to lobbyists and politicians who deny the existence of climate change.
Earlier this year, Amazon shareholders rejected an investor-led proposal that called for the company to disclose how its business could be disrupted by climate change and how it could reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
Amazon had recommended investors vote against the measure, in part, because it said it was already making certain disclosures on the topic.
The group of Amazon employees said on Twitter that the company'sThursday announcement was a win, but said they still plan to walk on Friday. "We're thrilled at what workers have achieved in under a year. But we know it's not enough," the group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice said in a tweet.

Full text: The New York State Common Retirement Fund said 11 U.S. companies agreed to changes in their climate policies and practices, as the third-largest public pension fund in the U.S. pushes for environmental, social and governance improvements within its portfolio.
New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, the retirement fund's trustee, said the fund filed shareholder proposals with 15 companies seeking a variety of changes and reached agreements with 11 of the companies.
Among the changes, the fund said utility company Vistra Energy Corp., which it called one of the largest greenhouse-gas emitters in its public equity portfolio, agreed to set targets for reducing those emissions.
The fund said Dollar General Corp., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Capri Holdings Ltd. and Under Armour Inc. agreed to set targets for increased energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy. Energy companies Concho Resources Inc., Range Resources Inc. and Diamondback Energy Inc. agreed to assess and disclose the business impact of regulatory efforts to limit climate change.
Aggregates producer Martin Marietta Materials Inc. agreed to assess and report on risks and opportunities available in the global transition to a lower carbon economy. And American Financial Group Inc. and Papa John's International Inc. agreed to produce sustainability reports that include plans for addressing climate change's impact on their businesses.

Full text: Finding home insurance in wildfire-prone parts of California is getting more difficult and more expensive. No one can agree on how to make it any easier.
A new flashpoint is the use of algorithmic models for predicting catastrophe losses. Insurers have long used these models to project losses from natural disasters but insurers, homeowners and regulators disagree on how they should be applied to assess California's wildfire risk.
Insurers are pushing for broader permission from the state to use catastrophe models when setting rates. But some consumers say those models are opaque and fail to adequately capture wildfire risk.
The debate over catastrophe models is part of a broader disagreement between insurers and consumer advocates over how to respond to two years of record-breaking wildfire damage in the Golden State. Many residents of fire-prone areas are either paying more for insurance or having problems securing it, and the state has warned that the situation is likely to get worse.
California wildfires cost insurers more than $24 billion in 2017 and 2018. One insurer, Merced Property & Casualty Co., was pushed to insolvency and liquidated by the state following the 2018 Camp Fire.
"Insurers are acting as you would expect where the risk is going up. They're adjusting their pricing and deciding in some cases that the risk is too high," said Dave Jones, senior director at the Nature Conservancy and a former California insurance commissioner. But without drastic steps to address climate change, he said, "we're marching steadily towards a future where the wildfire risk is uninsurable."
Catastrophe models are sold to insurers by vendors including RMS, a unit of Daily Mail & General Trust PLC, and AIR Worldwide, a unit of Verisk Analytics Inc. Insurers also use products like Verisk's FireLine, which assigns properties a score of zero to 30 based on their wildfire risk.
In California, insurers can't use catastrophe models when setting statewide average rates for standard home-insurance policies, which include wildfire coverage. State regulations require insurers to rely on historical-loss data when calculating expected future losses.
California's insurance regulations are more stringent than those of most states. Insurers need to get approval before they can change the rates they charge, and rate filings are made public.
Though an insurer's average California home-insurance rate has to be based on historical data, the insurer can use catastrophe models to determine how to price policies for certain regions or segments of the market. Insurers also can use these models when deciding whether or not to insure a specific property.
But the insurance industry says its pricing would be more accurate if it could use the forward-looking models when setting overall rates. Catastrophe models run tens of thousands of simulations to project a range of possible scenarios.
Insurers say models provide a more comprehensive view of risk than historical data and are able to take climate change into account.
"We're told there's a new normal" due to climate change, which regulators and scientists have said increases wildfire risk, said Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California. But under current regulations, "we cannot use probabilistic modeling that attempts to build a rate based upon where models suggest losses will go."
Consumer advocates say the models don't give homeowners and communities enough credit for taking steps to mitigate their wildfire exposure through brush-clearing and other efforts.
"They want to have a black-box model and not let the public or advocates see what's in it," said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.
Patty Swenson of Montecito, Calif., was told earlier this year that the insurance policy for her five-bedroom home wouldn't be renewed. Her insurance agent said the insurer had cited the house's proximity to a forest as a reason, Ms. Swenson said.
But the forest near Ms. Swenson's home burned in the 2017 Thomas Fire, she said, which she thinks makes it less likely to burn again. Ms. Swenson added that her property is cleared of flammable brush and that the Montecito community has invested in safety measures to protect it from fire-related debris flow.
Ms. Swenson was able to find another insurer, but her new coverage limit is lower, leaving her underinsured, she said. "Everything we've done has further mitigated the risk of a future disaster," Ms. Swenson said. "That should count for something."
One concern for regulators is that until recently, wildfire models were less sophisticated than hurricane and earthquake models. Many insurers were shocked by the extent of the damage in 2017 and 2018 and said the previous models didn't predict those losses.
Both AIR and RMS have released new wildfire models in the past two years that they say are more predictive than past models.
But different models might still reach different conclusions about the risk facing a certain property or book of business.

Full text: BRASILIA -- Brazil's environment minister said economic development in the Amazon is the best way to protect the rainforest, accusing foreigners and his leftist predecessors of trying to turn the region into an untouchable sanctuary.
Ricardo Salles, who took office in January under conservative President Jair Bolsonaro, told The Wall Street Journal the government plans to develop the forest's industries -- from mining to palm-oil production -- giving people in the region an alternative to illegal deforestation and wildcat farming.
"There are more than 20 million people living in the Amazon who need to survive," he said. "The Amazon is not just a zoo to be observed."
His comments come in the wake of a bitter showdown between Mr. Bolsonaro and European leaders, who have accused him of accelerating deforestation and endangering one of the planet's best natural defenses against climate change.
French President Emmanuel Macron has threatened to pull out of a landmark trade deal clinched in June between several South American nations and the European Union, while Germany and Norway have suspended funding for environmental projects in protest.
Multinational companies have joined the backlash, with H&M, one of the world's largest clothing brands, becoming the latest group on Thursday to suspend leather purchases from Brazil over fears that land grabbers are racing to clear the Amazon for pasture.
From January through the end of July, some 1,800 square miles of rainforest have been cleared -- almost the size of Delaware, and nearly 70% more than in the period last year, according to Brazil's space agency.
The number of fires in the Amazon -- the preferred method by land grabbers to clear forest that is then illegally sold to farmers and ranchers -- has more than doubled from 2018, the agency said.
Environmentalists have blamed Mr. Bolsonaro for the greater destruction, pointing to budget cuts at Ibama, the government's environmental protection group, and his fiery pro-farming rhetoric that they say has given loggers more confidence to cut down the forest.
"This creates a sense of impunity that is clear to see across the region," said Mauricio Voivodic, executive director in Brazil of WWF, the global conservation group.
Mr. Voivodic said existing laws already allow forest dwellers to survive from its resources and the government should focus on stopping illegal deforestation. "The administration is making a mistake," he said.
Mr. Salles agreed that Mr. Bolsonaro's rhetoric may have changed behavior among some illegal loggers, but said that the president had been misunderstood.
"There are people who created false expectations that this government would allow illegal logging," said Mr. Salles, adding that the government strictly opposes any type of crime.
Mr. Bolsonaro's administration has argued that cuts to Ibama's budget were in line with general budget cuts to combat the country's fiscal crisis.
Ibama has issued fewer fines under Mr. Bolsonaro -- 2,662 from January to August this year, compared with 3,213 in the period last year, Mr. Salles said. He said the decrease was insignificant, but it didn't matter because the current system wasn't working anyway given that authorities estimate that only 5% of the fines, or even less, are ever paid.
Mr. Salles also rejected criticism that the government has dismantled Ibama, saying that he fired regional bosses who didn't agree with his policies, and has struggled to replace them given the low salaries for those posts.
Instead, he criticized Brazil's former leftist leaders and foreign-backed organizations in the Amazon, accusing them of trying to turn the region into an "open-air museum" for trees, where people are only allowed to exist in primitive ways.

Full text: There are plenty of disputes that will be with us for years to come. Should global warming be pinned on humans? Is health care a universal right? Are my Detroit Lions the worst professional sports franchise in history, or would that be the Cleveland Browns?
A perennial debate in Corporate America is whether a public company exists solely to enrich shareholders or in service of a broader constituency. The question is re-emerging as investors like Warren Buffett and BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink bash short-term thinking and promote sustainable business practices.
Last month, 181 CEOs signed a 300-word Business Roundtable letter that said they agree. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, chairing the Roundtable's governance committee, said the new statement "affirms the essential role corporations can play in improving our society when CEOs are truly committed to meeting the needs of all stakeholders."
Let me unravel Mr. Gorsky's quote using clearer terms. In the pecking order of things executives should care about, the shareholder needs to share the ball with employees, vendors, customers and society writ large. This mirrors a stance the Business Roundtable took in the 1980s, when corporate raiders and leveraged buyouts were reshaping our view of the type of power investors could wield.
Now, even as investor interests are increasingly cast as the root of many social problems, I offer this word of encouragement to shareholders: You may be unpopular, but you are still king.
The regulatory disclosures of most of the companies the Business Roundtable represents tell me that senior leaders get paid for performance, and by "performance" we mean stock price. Almost all of their CEOs issue financial guidance, buy back sums of stock that dwarf capital spending, and equate a healthy share price with a healthy payday.
This won't change until the compensation model gets turned upside down. Because there are few concrete and generally accepted ways to judge executive performance beyond share price, it's unclear if the compensation model will ever actually get turned upside down.
Ira Kay, a managing partner at New York compensation consultancy Pay Governance, said boards have long given managers wide discretion to improve diversity, address climate change or improve customer satisfaction. And annual bonuses are often partially tied to those goals, but that is just a fraction of total compensation. "If you don't get your stock price up, you're not going to make $25 million; you'll make more like $2 million," Mr. Kay said.
CEOs, like professional athletes, have a limited time to maximize earnings. Average tenures are shortening to about five years, and many get only one shot in the captain's chair. Executives ignoring the methods by which shareholder returns are maximized -- whether it be via share buybacks, pay raises, capital expenditures or layoffs -- are ignoring their self-interest.
Boards readily acknowledge this. "We design our annual and long-term incentives to include metrics that focus on profitability, operating efficiency and investor returns," American Airlines Group, for instance, said in its most-recent proxy statement. If you want information on broader social goals, the board encourages readers to pick up the sustainability report.
Wondering if CEO Doug Parker understands this? Look no further than the section of the proxy outlining how 100% of his pay comes in the form of stock. This was good when American Airlines was riding high, but it's been a turbulent summer for the Texas-based carrier amid labor tensions and other hiccups. Shareholders have suffered. No one has more incentive than Mr. Parker to fix that.
In fact, most of the Business Roundtable signatories are playing by similar rules.
Best Buy Co., for instance, said its "philosophy is to align executive compensation with shareholders' interests." The retailer's proxy outlines how to measure that in a slick chart that highlights investor returns, revenue growth, earnings performance and cost reduction. It's probably safe to bet Best Buy's new CEO Corie Barry is as familiar with that equation as with recycling policies, employee-engagement stats or recycling efforts.
Experts like Mr. Kay say executive compensation is linked to the stock price because it is widely believed that companies that pursue good practices generally grow in value.
"If you want to be in business next year, then you've got to be good to your customers, employees and suppliers," Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, which consults institutional investors, told me this week.
J&J's Mr. Gorsky is learning first hand that sins of the past will eventually bite you in the pocketbook.
One week after the Business Roundtable letter was published, the world's largest health-care company was hit with a judgment forcing it to pay $572 million for Oklahoma's opioid crisis. The verdict is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to potential liabilities that J&J and other pharmaceutical companies face.
Ms. Minow said she understands the need for corporations to tell a better story about sustainability, social responsibility or employee satisfaction, particularly as younger buyers, workers and investors gain influence. There ultimately needs to be a way to universally measure success.
Of course, what's good for the shareholder isn't always good for the future of the company. General Electric spent years touting its focus on investor returns only to see its stock price collapse after serious flaws in business strategy and other issues emerged. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating certain accounting practices, and the company has lost its blue-chip status.
Mr. Kay said his firm's research suggests GE's saga is the exception, but its decline is a lesson for other industries. Executives spanning oil companies to traditional retailers need to shift their thinking on several issues or prepare for a long demise.
Stock prices aren't perfect. Still, they offer the most concise measure of whether a company is on the fast track or a death march.

Full text: A year ago, a 15-year-old in leopard-print tights sat down outside the Swedish Parliament building with a purple backpack and a sign announcing she was on strike over climate change.
This week, Greta Thunberg arrived by solar-powered sailboat in New York, now as the 16-year-old poster child for younger generations' climate angst. Also making its way to the New World, as evidenced in the coverage of her carbon-neutral trip, was a concept that has swept Europe: flight shame, often hashtagged in the original Swedish, #flygskam.
It didn't start with Greta, but something about her passion for the issue fed her countrymen's unease over carbon-spewing vacations to Thailand. While Greta inspired youth strikes across the world, took the train to Davos to berate world leaders and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, Swedes changed their behavior.
Domestic-flight passengers were down 8% this year through July, compared with the same period in 2018, according to Swedish airport operator Swedavia, while international passengers fell 3%. The weak Swedish krona may have damped some travel, but it appears many of the nonflyers took the train instead: Swedish rail operator SJ reported an 8% uptick in travel during the first quarter this year.
So far, flight shame and train brag have been largely a European phenomenon, in part helped along by factors like carbon taxes that increase the cost of flying. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines even urged its customers to fly less, suggesting they take the train for shorter trips As Greta arrived in New York, the question was whether flight shame would strike a nerve in America, too.
Rail travel is a viable option in most of Europe, but less so in much of America. And U.S. demand for air travel is climbing, not decreasing. Ed Bastian, chief executive of Delta Air Lines Inc., told The Wall Street Journal in July that he doesn't expect environmental concerns to knock that off course. "We provide an incredibly important service to customers," he said.
Industry trade group Airlines for America points out that U.S. carriers transported 42% more passengers and cargo in 2018 compared with 2000, with just a 3% increase in total emissions.
For anyone committed not to fly, myriad obstacles quickly pop up, even if no ocean crossing is involved.
Roger Tyers, an environmental-sociology researcher at the University of Southampton, had pledged not to fly this year or next when he won a scholarship to study Chinese attitudes to sustainability. True to his word, he embarked on a two-week journey to Beijing involving 21 train connections. The whole thing cost more than GBP 2,000 (about $2,400), almost three times the cost of a round-trip flight. Still, he terms his trip "a steal" in terms of carbon emissions.
Mr. Tyers stresses he wasn't shamed into it. "Some flyers may feel 'shame', 'discomfort' or 'unease' because of the disconnect between their environmental concern and their flying behavior," he wrote in an email. "That is what happened to me, so I quit."
Such soul-searching is behind the changed behavior in Sweden, too, academics say.
"Shame is often thought of as a bad emotion, but it can also be an important emotional bearer of information that encourages us to take responsibility for our actions," says Maria Wolrath-Soderberg, a researcher at Sodertorn University in Stockholm who studies climate rhetoric.
Amanda LaValle, a mother of three from Kingston, N.Y., acknowledged how difficult it can be to put her principles into practice. Earlier in August, when she needed to travel to Minneapolis for a three-day training sponsored by Al Gore's Climate Reality Project, she briefly considered taking the train. But, she said, "It would have taken two days and I couldn't see taking more time away from my family."
Greta's voyage has had critics who pointed out that some members of the sailing crew will return by plane, while others fly in to sail the boat back to Europe.
Boris Herrmann, captain of the sailboat, Malizia II, said the criticism was expected but that Greta shouldn't be held responsible for flights by crew members. "We're a professional sailing team and sometimes we need to fly," he said, noting the team offsets its flights by funding sustainability projects. "The trip is an example of how difficult it is to have zero carbon impact."

Full text: CANDEIAS DO JAMARI, Brazil -- No one knows for sure how the fire started here off a two-lane highway called BR-364.
It could have been a farmer burning scrub grass to prepare his field for planting manioc roots. Or it might have been a rancher torching trees to open space for more pasture.
Whatever the cause, the result was yet another roaring blaze in the world's greatest rainforest, one of more than 43,000 fires this year that have flared in Brazil's Amazon region.
Last week, as office workers were returning from their lunch breaks in the region's largest metropolis, Sao Paulo, smoke mixed with rain clouds, turning day into night.
Drivers turned on their headlights, others panicked, and religious groups predicted the second coming of Jesus. "I thought the world was ending!" said Ozana Lopes, a cleaner.
To hear global environmentalists talk, that isn't much of an overstatement. Within hours, celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Madonna as well as world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were raising the alarm about the fate of the world's most biodiverse forest.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who jokingly calls himself "Captain Chainsaw," has responded with defiance. When the fires first drew global attention, the 64-year-old leader blamed environmental groups for starting them. He told a reporter at a recent press conference to defecate less to reduce pollution, and told European leaders to reforest their own countries before criticizing his.
Since taking office in January, the ex-military man has cut the budget of Brazil's anti-deforestation agency Ibama by a quarter amid general fiscal tightening, and made it harder to fine illegal loggers, arguing that excessive environmental controls have stifled the nation's economic progress.
"The fire that burns the brightest is that of our own sovereignty over the Amazon," Mr. Bolsonaro declared.
The standoff goes much deeper than the policies of one president, reviving age-old conspiracy theories here over foreigners' plans to take control of the Amazon and rein in economic growth. Deforestation has been rising since 2015 as Brazil's deepest recession on record pushed poorer Brazilians into illegal logging. It has accelerated since Mr. Bolsonaro took office in January, though some of his predecessors drastically loosened environmental protections.
"The biggest problem right now is the media and the NGOs," said Daniel Vaz Da Rocha, boss of a lumber company in Rondonia state, where the fire next to BR-364 started. "They're ganging up on the president," he said, as smoke from another out-of-control fire clouded the sunset.
Mr. Bolsonaro's government says it is trying to balance the interests of the environment and provide an economic future for the 20 million residents of the Amazon region. Officials say they will go after illegal activities like chopping down the forest. On Wednesday, Mr. Bolsonaro issued a decree banning anyone from setting fires to clear land for 60 days.
"We are a government with a zero-tolerance policy on crime, and the environment will be no exception," Mr. Bolsonaro said in a televised address last week.
Environmental activists nonetheless worry this may mark the beginning of a new era of destruction in the Amazon, one of the planet's best natural defenses against climate change, pushing the region dangerously close to a tipping point where the forest is unable to regenerate and morphs into savanna, permanently reducing rainfall across much of South America.
The future of a landmark trade deal clinched in June between the European Union and South American nations is now in doubt as Western leaders assail Mr. Bolsonaro over the fires, with France proposing a possible international statute to protect the Amazon.
The Group of Seven countries has offered $22 million in aid, but Mr. Bolsonaro has threatened to refuse it unless Mr. Macron apologizes for having called him a liar about his commitment to the environment. Earlier this week he accepted a $12 million aid offer from the U.K.
The stakes are also high for Brazil's giant agribusiness sector, which accounts for roughly a fifth of the economy. The owner of footwear brands Timberland and Vans said Thursday it would no longer buy Brazilian leather.
The government and ordinary Brazilians point out that rates of deforestation and burning are a quarter of their peak levels in the past, and that the country in recent years has taken extraordinary measures to protect the forest. Under a 2012 law, for instance, farmers in the Amazon are required to set aside 80% of their land as forest.
There are fires every year in the Amazon region. Like much of the developing world, farmers here set fire to their fields during the dry season to reduce pests and prepare for planting. But some of the fires have a more sinister origin. Every year, when the rains stop around April, wildcat loggers in Brazil get to work clearing out the rainforest to illegally grab the land.
Using heavy machinery, they uproot trees they can sell, and chop down much of the rest, allowing it to dry out for a few months before torching it. They then sell the cleared land to farmers and ranchers. The fires usually peak during July through September.
The number of fires, then, is a strong signal of deforestation. This year's 43,421 fires in the Amazon region are more than double the 19,229 fires during the same period last year. It is the highest level since 2010, when a major drought caused a big spike.
The data from Brazil's space research institute backs this up. From January through the end of July, some 1,800 square miles of rainforest had been cleared -- an area a bit smaller than Delaware, and nearly 70% more than in the same period last year. Mr. Bolsonaro has called the agency's data a lie, and had the director fired in early August.
Cities across the Amazon are still blanketed in smoke, so thick over recent days that one of the region's main airports was forced to suspend flights, a professional soccer game was halted after players struggled to see the ball and hospitals reported surging respiratory complaints.
The Amazon has for decades been a symbol for environmental activists. Its scale is staggering -- it takes up over half the area of the contiguous U.S. The rainforest plays a key role in regulating global temperatures by absorbing about 5% of all global carbon dioxide emissions, according to Carlos Nobre, a researcher at the University of Sao Paulo.
"The global objective here is to avoid a giant climate crisis with enormous consequences for the rest of the world," said Mr. Nobre.
Satellite data suggests about 18% of the forest has now disappeared, mostly since the 1960s. Some of the worst destruction took place in the 1980s, the mid-1990s and again in the early 2000s. This year's deforestation of some 1,800 square miles is far lower than the more than 10,000 square miles cleared in 2004, for instance.
After first blaming NGOs, Mr. Bolsonaro later blamed this year's rise in fires on particularly dry and hot conditions in the region.
Data from Inmet, Brazil's Meteorological National Institute, show that medium temperatures this year in badly affected regions are similar to last year, while rainfall has been higher. Rio Branco, the capital of Acre state, where the number of fires has more than doubled since last year, got 7.4 inches of rain in June and July this year, the highest volume for that two-month period since 2013, Inmet data show.
Deep in the Amazon, about half of which is federally protected, many Brazilians can't see what all the fuss is about. Environmentalists have far more power over the forest than in decades past. Ibama, the forest protection agency, even has a commando-style unit that busts up illegal logging operations.
"It is hard these days!" said one 49-year-old logger in Rondonia, a landlocked state deep in the Amazon. "Ibama is everywhere now, they have helicopters in the sky," he said.
Across the Amazon, farmers and ranchers say Mr. Bolsonaro has been a welcome respite from growing environmental regulation that suffocates their productivity. A former captain under Brazil's military dictatorship, Mr. Bolsonaro made it clear through his presidential campaign that he supported agricultural development in the region, lambasting what he called Ibama's "industry of fines."
Joao Bosco, 73, owns 28,000 head of cattle in five ranches of about 9,000 acres each in Para state, where deforestation and fires have been rampant for years. He has been in the area since 2002 and sells his production to nearby meatpackers, who export 30% of the production, he said.
"Previous administrations did things that made no sense, like forcing ranchers to preserve 80% of their property," he said. "Where on earth is it reasonable?"
Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters see him as having two powerful allies: President Trump and God. While the U.S. president has publicly backed Mr. Bolsonaro on Twitter over the fires, rainfall over recent days in the Amazon has convinced some that God is lending a helping hand to Brazil's devoutly Christian leader.
However, for environmentalists and groups working to protect the forest, Mr. Bolsonaro represents one of the biggest threats to the region in recent history.
Invasions of indigenous land increased the moment Mr. Bolsonaro took office, with loggers cutting down mahogany and other lucrative trees before torching the land, said Ivanete Bandeira Cardozo, project coordinator of Kaninde, a nonprofit group here in Rondonia state that helps indigenous tribes.
Mr. Bolsonaro's rhetoric alone was enough to change loggers' behavior, she said.
"They feel comfortable that they won't get fined . . . they know the government is on their side," said Ms. Cardozo, adding that she believes the fires are the worst she has seen in about 10 years. Nonprofits like hers have also come under vigorous attack since Mr. Bolsonaro took office, she said. Her staff have received death threats and are followed when they venture into the forest.
Under Mr. Bolsonaro, Brazil's environmental-law apparatus is being dismantled, said Daniel Azeredo, the country's top environmental prosecutor. He said Ibama has reduced the number of raids, and no longer uses a system to audit suspicious cash transfers in the region. Ibama declined to comment.
"This idea that there was an industry of fines is nonsense. What dominates is impunity," he said, adding that less than 1% of fines are ever paid.
Brazil has cut spending in many areas to help shore up government finances. The Environment Ministry budget was cut by 23.7%, according to official data, while this year's federal budget was slashed by 24.4%. The budget to fight fires in Brazil's forests and savanna was cut by 23%, according to opposition party PSOL, citing government data to which it had access.
As fires spread in Candeias do Jamari, there was little the authorities could do.
Seven environmental protection agents feverishly worked to fight the fire devouring a small ranch, creating a firebreak with chain saws and machetes. Four small government aircraft drenched the trees with water.
It took other agents almost an hour under the burning sun just to locate the fire. First they encountered a giant tree trunk blocking the main access road to the site -- a tactic often used by locals to keep out government inspectors and firefighters. They didn't have a saw. Then coordinates passed on from colleagues the previous day led them in the wrong direction. When they were finally getting close they encountered a rickety bridge too precarious to cross.
What the flames left behind looked apocalyptic: smoldering tree trunks, bushes burned to a crisp and a white covering, ashes, on what had once been forest floor.

Energy Companies Set to Get Reprieve on Methane Rules

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is moving to erase Obama-era rules on methane emissions from the oil-and-gas business, saying the federal government overstepped its authority when it set limits on what scientists say is a significant contributor to climate change.
The sweeping proposal, formally introduced Wednesday, is the administration's latest attempt to further boost record crude-oil and natural-gas production by easing regulations. But it comes amid growing concerns over how the industry's methane emissions are affecting the climate and stark divisions among companies over whether to regulate them.
"The purpose of this rule is to get to the fundamental basis of whether [methane] should have been regulated in the first place," said Anne Idsal, the acting assistant administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air and Radiation, referring to the proposed rollback. "It's not about whether we're doing the maximum we can or should do to deal with" climate change.
"I don't see that there's going to be some big climate concern here," Ms. Idsal added.
The vast majority of climate research identifies human-caused emissions as the primary driver of climate change, most commonly through carbon-dioxide emissions from sources including factories, planes and cars. But methane, which accounts for about 10% of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping the earth's heat, according to estimates used by the EPA. Its figures show the oil-and-gas industry has long been the nation's largest emitter of methane, even before discoveries in shale and fracking led to a wave of new drilling.
The proposed plan would do away with Obama-era requirements for the industry to install technologies that monitor and limit leaks from new wells, tanks and pipeline networks, and to more frequently inspect for leaks.
It would also forestall legal requirements that would have forced the EPA to set rules on emissions from thousands of pre-existing wells and industry sites.
Some companies have asked for the rollback, while others, including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, have warned the Trump administration that a lack of government-backed minimum requirements to curb emissions could undermine the argument that natural gas is a cleaner fuel. They also say legal wrangling could lead to years of uncertainty before deregulation would lower costs.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents hundreds of companies, has diverged from those major producers and has pressed the administration to stop the direct regulation of methane emissions. It has instead touted a voluntary program under which companies commit to more inspections and to replacing or retrofitting old control systems.
Both API and EPA officials say the industry has an incentive to limit emissions because it can sell the gas it traps. They note the industry's methane emissions, by EPA calculations, have ticked down in recent years even as oil-and-gas production has skyrocketed.
"Nothing stops [companies] from taking whatever voluntary measures they think is appropriate to deal with those concerns," Ms. Idsal said. "Our job at the EPA is to regulate in a legally and scientifically responsible manner."
President Trump has called climate change a hoax. His appointees say the Clean Air Act is limited in the authority it gives to set climate policy. The new proposal is a win for business interests that have lobbied to curb such federal authority.
The proposal's publication in the Federal Register starts the clock on a 60-day public-comment period, which then would likely be followed by a lengthy Trump administration review. The administration aims to finalize the rules in 2020, the last year of Mr. Trump's term.
The proposed rollback is likely to draw protests from environmental groups and will probably face legal challenges, opening the door to years of uncertainty about if and how the government will regulate methane.
Methane is the primary component of natural gas, which is rising in use globally to heat homes and fuel power plants. It burns more cleanly than coal and oil but can be harder to control. The production and transport of methane involves millions of miles of pipelines, and the gas often leaks through the network's innumerable joints and vents.
Before it is burned, methane is so potent that the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit that often collaborates with industry partners, estimates its emissions cause about a quarter of the planet's warming, according to EPA figures. A Wall Street Journal analysis recently found the U.S. oil-and-gas industry's methane emissions alone were the equivalent to the greenhouse-gas emissions from more than 69 million cars, or about one-fourth of all cars registered in the U.S.
The industry leaks about 2.3% of all the natural gas it produces, according to a series of studies finished last year and led by the Environmental Defense Fund. It suggested initial efforts to study methane emissions had far underestimated them by missing large, unplanned leaks, especially from storage tanks and processing plants. At that rate, these emissions would largely negate any climate benefits from an ongoing shift to gas as a replacement for carbon-intensive energy from coal, according to the analysis.
"Without nationwide methane regulation, industry is only as strong as its weakest link," Ben Ratner, a senior director who works with companies on methane reduction at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a March blog post.
The Trump administration proposal would remove storage tanks, pipelines and other transmission infrastructure from any greenhouse-gas regulation.
EPA policy has long classified them as a separate business from oil-and-gas production, legally requiring them to be evaluated separately, the proposal says. The Trump administration claims its predecessors erred in evaluating and regulating production and transmission together. Once separated, neither branch of the oil industry produces enough methane emissions on its own to merit federal oversight, administration officials said.

Full text: MOSCOW -- A double blow of floods and wildfires in Russia this summer is injecting fresh urgency into rethinking the country's usually skeptical stance toward the dangers posed by climate change.
Smoke from massive wildfires raging across an area the size of Belgium has engulfed hundreds of villages in Siberia -- and spread as far as Seattle and Vancouver. Floods in the same region took 25 lives and displaced more than 30,000 people. Russian scientists say climate change was a major factor in both disasters.
President Vladimir Putin warns that Russia is being hit hard, with temperatures in the country rising 2 1/2 times as fast as the global average. His government recently decided to ratify the 2015 Paris climate agreement and introduced proposals for a law capping industrial emissions.
In Paris on Monday, Mr. Putin discussed climate change with French President Emmanuel Macron, saying Moscow is adopting programs and allocating major resources in combating it.
"We take this matter very seriously," Mr. Putin said. "We have to coordinate our efforts. We are prepared for this joint work."
It's a break from the past. Mr. Putin had long been ambiguous about the need for stronger climate-control measures. Russia is the world's largest exporter of oil and gas combined, which is the heart of its economy. Mr. Putin previously described climate change as a part of a natural cycle that could benefit Russians. The country is expected to see better shipping access through the Arctic Sea and more opportunities for mining and drilling. Mr. Putin once joked in 2016 that people would save money on fur coats.
But Alexey Kokorin, head of the climate change program at the Russian branch of the environmental organization World Wide Fund for Nature, said the government's approach has changed.
"There's a shift in mentality," he said. "There's better understanding of the necessity of adaptation, both to negative climate events, such as this year's fires and floods, and to the [global trend toward a] new lower-carbon economy."
The proposal to cap emissions -- which would be the first such law in Russia -- follows similar measures introduced in the European Union and Australia. If enacted, it would take effect in 2022 and penalize companies that exceed the limits.
Industrial groups say the legislation would hurt their businesses. Alexander Shokhin, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, warned in July that companies will have to account for the proposed law in their spending plans, slowing investment. Consumers, too, could feel the pain if the law raises energy prices, industrialists say.
Mr. Putin has urged Russian businesses not to oppose the measure, saying Russia could fall behind other countries in adapting to the threat posed by climate change.
"The more they see the costs from climate change rising, the more Russian authorities would change their calculation," said Fabian Burkhardt, a Russia researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. He said the Kremlin is particularly concerned about the economic impact of climate change and how it might affect social order and the government's long-term support.
Russia "pays increased attention to climate change issues . . . [and] fully shares the concerns about the current trajectory of global warming and its associated risks," the Ministry of National Resources and Environment said in a statement.

Full text: Some shale drillers want consumers to know that their natural gas was sustainably fracked.
Many of the companies behind the U.S. shale boom are stepping up efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, toxic wastewater and other environmental impacts tied to fracking, amid mounting pressure over climate change.
Now, drillers such as Southwestern Energy Co. and BP PLC are seeking to monetize those investments by marketing their natural gas as a cleaner fossil fuel, akin to organic vegetables or fair-trade coffee.
"It's the same molecule. But it's not so much about what we produce, but how we produce it," said Mark Boling, a former executive at Southwestern, which last year reached a deal for gas touted as responsibly produced, selling it to utility New Jersey Natural Gas Co.
In Texas, BP is testing blockchain technology that would allow its gas to be tracked through the supply chain, enabling customers to know when they are buying BP-fracked fuel. The oil giant is investing in technology to limit methane leaks, and it is part of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, an industry group whose members have pledged to collectively cut average methane emissions to less than 0.25% of gas sold by 2025.
"We do all the work on the ground to differentiate what we produce," said Brian Pugh, chief innovation officer for BP's U.S. onshore business.
Some environmental groups say that regulation, not green marketing, is the way to ensure sustainable practices. Unlike fair-trade standards or federal rules that govern organic labeling, there is no widely accepted industry definition for responsibly fracked gas.
"It's hard not to be dismissive," said Andrew Logan, senior director for oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit focused on sustainability.
Part of the demand for greener gas is being driven by utilities, which are looking for more information on the gas they purchase as they seek to satisfy growing consumer demand for cleaner energy. Richmond, Va.-based Dominion Energy Inc. launched a procurement process this year for gas deemed to have been responsibly sourced, and Vermont Gas Systems Inc. plans to release a request for proposals in the fall.
Vermont Gas hopes that responsibly fracked gas ultimately will become its standard offering. "Our goal is to stimulate responsible production and transportation," Chief Executive Don Rendall said.
The initiatives would piggyback onto more-established programs that charge customers a premium for methane produced by landfills and farms, dubbed renewable natural gas.
Institutions such as Middlebury College and the University of Vermont Medical Center have committed to purchasing renewable natural gas, which qualifies as a biofuel under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, to meet sustainability targets. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is far more potent than carbon dioxide in contributing to climate change, meaning it is better for the environment to capture and burn it than to allow it to escape directly into the atmosphere.
Dominion is joining Smithfield Foods Inc. to develop the infrastructure to collect roughly 3 million cubic feet a day of methane from hog farms in Utah, North Carolina and Virginia, said Gary Courts, Dominion's general manager for new gas business development. The company estimates that is enough to power about 14,000 homes and businesses.
"Our world is changing, and what we find is our customers want different things," Mr. Courts said.
---
Groups Work on
Standards for Gas
Groups are working to develop credible standards to declare certain sources of gas as greener than others.
Criteria for responsibly fracked gas have included leak rates, water contamination levels and engagement with area residents.
New Jersey Natural Gas Co. agreed to pay an undisclosed premium for responsibly produced gas from Southwestern Energy Co. that was evaluated by ratings firm Independent Energy Standards Corp. The fuel made up 14% of the utility's supply, according to a spokesman, who said it closed a second deal with Southwestern in May. New Jersey Natural Gas doesn't market this greener gas to customers separately or charge more for it.
Herve Mahe, a restaurant owner in Burlington, Vt., said he potentially would be interested in buying greener gas, but would want to know more about how the extraction process affected neighboring communities.
"Whenever you think fracking, you don't think clean," said Mr. Mahe, a Vermont Gas Systems Inc. customer. "At this point I'm not sure I would believe them until they prove it."
Vermont Gas already offers its customers options to purchase renewable gas. The average residential customer would pay an additional $88 a month for all of their gas to come from facilities such as landfills or farms, or an extra $10 a month for 10% renewable natural gas, according to the company's calculator.

Full text: LEH, India -- The Ladakh region of northern India is one of the world's highest, driest inhabited places. For centuries, meltwater from winter snows in the Himalayan mountains sustained the tiny villages dotting this remote land.
Now, like many other places in India, parts of Ladakh are running short of water. A tourism boom has sent the summer population soaring, and the region's traditional system of conserving water is breaking down.
Water crises are unfolding all across India, a product of population growth, modernization, climate change, mismanagement and the breakdown of traditional systems of distributing resources. India is running out of water in more places, in more different ways, putting more people at risk, than perhaps any other country.
Nearly all of India's biggest cities, including New Delhi, the nation's capital, are rapidly depleting their groundwater reserves, and 40% of India's people could lack drinking water by the end of the next decade, according to a 2018 report by NITI Aayog, a government-policy think tank.
In Ladakh, making matters worse, the winter snows were scarce last year. In the fields above the city of Leh, tensions ran high.
Wheat farmer Tsering Wangchuck, 67, regularly rose at 3 a.m. to send water into his fields before others living at higher elevation awoke. At times, he had to march back uphill to confront a neighbor who had arrived later to redirect the water his way.
"You had to check all the time," he said. "It was frustrating."
India is the 13th most water-stressed country in the world, but its population is triple the combined population of the other 16 countries facing extremely high water stress, according to the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit group with offices around the world that tracks water use and other global environmental and resource issues.
Water resources in India have been mismanaged for decades. Critical groundwater resources, which account for 40% of India's water supply, are being depleted at unsustainable rates, the NITI Aayog report said. Droughts are becoming more frequent, creating severe problems for India's rain-dependent farmers.
By 2030, water demand in India is projected to be twice the available supply, according to the report. "If nothing changes, and fast, things will get much worse . . . with severe water scarcity on the horizon for hundreds of millions," the report said.
In the southern city of Chennai, drinking water reserves almost completely dried up this year. Although a 200-day streak with no rain ended recently, the first month of the annual monsoon brought one-third less rain than the 50-year average, which makes it the driest June in five years, according to the India Meteorological Department.
Two of Chennai's four reservoirs went dry, and the other two nearly did. Millions of residents of the city, India's fifth largest, with a population of about 10 million, get their drinking water from trucks -- either sporadically from government vehicles or by purchasing it from private companies.
In the agricultural heartland of India's northern plains, where almost one-third of the country's food is grown, farmers generally pay little or nothing for the groundwater they use or the energy needed to pump as much as they desire. That has led them to plant water-intensive crops, creating shortages, especially during lapses in the annual monsoons, that endanger the country's food supply.
Various Indian states are locked in legal and political battles with one another over the control and use of water flowing through the nation's legendary rivers, such as the Ganges.
Some tourist centers have run short of water. Last year, in the former British hill station of Simla, dozens of hotels had to cancel bookings and temporarily shut down, and the city's major summer festival was canceled. Government schools were closed for 10 days because they lacked water for the children and teachers.
"Until now, it's been relatively easy to increase supply without thinking too much about demand. But parts of India are beginning to hit the natural limits of water supply," said Mervyn Piesse, manager of the global food and water crises research program at Future Directions International, a research institute based in Australia. "Unless there is a reduction in the rate at which those resources are being used, they are eventually going to run out."
Beset by the multitude of water problems, Prime Minister Narendra Modi began his second term recently by appointing a ministry of water, combining previous ministries that oversaw wetlands and riverways development and drinking water and sanitation.
A warming climate is making water supplies more unpredictable throughout the Himalayan region, upon whose watershed some two billion people ultimately depend. A recent study by a nongovernmental organization that focuses on regional developmental issues, called the Hindu Kush Monitoring and Assessment Program, warned that glaciers feeding rivers in the Himalayan region could start disappearing after 2050.
Ladakh, which borders China and Pakistan in the nation's far north, became a formal Indian state earlier this month when the central government separated it from Jammu and Kashmir. It has long been isolated, especially in the winter, when many roads snow over and temperatures drop well below freezing. In the 1970s, the Indian government opened the region to tourism, drawing a trickle of mostly Western travelers who came to trek and to visit the ancient Buddhist monasteries along the Indus River.
Then came a 2010 hit Bollywood movie called "Three Idiots." The final song-and-dance extravaganza had two Indian megastars reuniting in love along the shores of Lake Pangong, then a small-time Ladakhi tourist attraction. Indian fans of the movie flocked to Ladakh to visit the lake.
The number of visitors to Ladakh, which has a year-round population of 133,000, has soared fivefold since the movie came out, reaching 327,000 last year. Most stay in Leh. Local tourism officials and hoteliers say many of the new tourists, unlike the adventure travelers who preceded them, tend to stay in hotels where they shower twice daily and use flush toilets instead of the waterless dry-pit latrines traditional to Ladakhi villages. They also favor tomatoes and peppers over the region's traditional potatoes and barley, which require far less water to grow.
The new tourists consume about 25% more water per person than longtime residents during the summer and double what the average resident uses in the winter, when cold weather curtails running water, according to Iftiqar Ahmed, an engineer in the Leh government's office of Public Health and Engineering, which oversees water use.
A hotel building boom in Leh has increased the number of rooms since 2010 to 16,000, from fewer than 2,000.
In need of a constant water supply, the new hotels drilled their own wells. By the time authorities started monitoring wells last year, they estimated hotels were pulling up more than a million liters of water a day during the June through August tourist peak, from ground water reserves fed by melting snow and glaciers, said Mr. Ahmed. They now account for 20% of the water used in the city, he said.
Outside Leh, where farming still underpins village life, water has long been treated as a precious commodity. To preserve it and assure equal distribution, the villagers appoint water managers, known as churpons, to oversee the collection of snowmelt into catchment ponds and dole it out through an ancient network of canals and sluices that run downhill past family farm plots. They ensure that families with plots at higher elevations who get the water first leave a fair share for families with plots at lower down.
In Saboo village, where some 300 families live a few miles outside Leh, Jigmat Stanzin, 47, has held that job, which rotates annually among village families. "We can't waste a drop," he says.
April to July 2018 were anxious months in Saboo. Villagers decided the home gardens that provide food to most households should get water first, then water would go to apricot and apple trees, which would take a decade to replace if they died. Then, wheat and barley fields, and, finally, the poplar trees used as building material.
Mr. Stanzin and a team of five other churpons worked around the clock. Some fields weren't planted and some crops were stunted. But the village made it through.
Leh, however, stopped using churpons in 2015 as farming gave way to tourism and other development. Mr. Wangchuck, who tends the family's farm with his wife, couldn't plant half his fields, forcing him to buy feed for his cows. His family cut back on what they ate and had less to sell in local markets.
The city itself came to the brink of catastrophe. Some hotel wells went dry as the paltry snowmelt failed to recharge underground springs fast enough.
As many as 100,000 seasonal migrant workers reside in and around Leh during the summer. Nearly all of them live in areas where water must be delivered by tanker truck, once every three days.
Longer term, Leh has an $11 million project to pump drinking water from the nearby Indus River. The project was planned in 2006, to be built through the year 2042, for a summer population projected to be 84,000 by then. But the summer population already is at least 90,000, Mr. Ahmed says. The project timeline has been accelerated for completion two years from now.
Until it is completed, water needs will be met with a patchwork of delivery systems. Some 4,500 households now have drinking water piped to their homes a few hours each day as part of the plan to deliver drinking water to all homes. During the winter, though, the pipes can freeze if they aren't drained at night.
Tanker-truck deliveries will continue to thousands of other households. Residents store the water in plastic vats that they have taken to padlocking to prevent theft.
Stanzin Namgyal, 52, grew up in Leh and is trying to revive the churpon system to supply meltwater to remaining farmers and the many residents with home gardens. Yet for the 23-room hotel he is building in the city center, he intends to bore wells. "I'll need one well, maybe even two," he said.
Last year, Leh began requiring residents and businesses to register their wells, but only a fraction of them did so. This year, the municipality is conducting inspections door-to-door to try to get an accurate count.
The eventual goal is to charge a fee for wells, and ultimately to begin metering and charging for water usage, although officials concede such measures may be years off.
Sonam Parvez, who also grew up in Leh, opened a 20-bed hotel and heads an association of some 300 hoteliers. When his parents operated a small guesthouse in Leh decades ago, he said, their water was allocated under the churpon system.
"The churpon system is people coming together and trusting each other," he said. "With the coming of the present day, that trust is gone because everyone is tapping into the bore well system. Everybody thinks there's free water down there. Last year, for the first time, Ladakhis discovered there's no free water."

Full text: This past July was the hottest month world-wide in more than a century of global record-keeping, with severe heat waves in Europe, Africa and parts of the U.S. boosting the overall global average temperature, federal climate scientists said Thursday.
Researchers at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which tracks global temperatures for federal policy makers, calculated that the average land and sea surface temperature world-wide for the month of July was 62.13 degrees Fahrenheit (16.7 degrees Celsius).
Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring section at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, which prepared the analysis, attributed the unusually hot July mostly to climate change.
The scientists based their analysis on readings from thousands of monitoring stations and ocean buoys world-wide. They said that such an unusually hot July, and the previous string of warm months, suggests this year would be among the five hottest on record.
The global temperature this past July surpassed a previous record set in 2016, the scientists said Thursday in a regular news conference on monthly temperature trends. Nine of the 10 warmest Julys in the modern record, which dates to 1880, have occurred since 2005, they said.
Last month's average temperature was 1.71 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th-century average, which is the benchmark typically used by scientists to gauge significant climate variations.
"It is virtually certain that we will have a top five warmest year on record, most likely to fall somewhere between second and fourth warmest, by the time the analysis is done at the end of the year," said Mr. Arndt.
The 10 hottest years overall since 1880 have all occurred since 1998, according to climate scientists at NOAA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who monitor global temperatures. So far, this year is tied with 2017 as the second-hottest year to date, according to NOAA.
Mr. Arndt said the lingering effects from a waning El Nino current in the Pacific Ocean also contributed by raising ocean temperatures. El Nino is a temporary but recurring weather phenomenon that increases Pacific Ocean temperatures.
"El Nino basically acts like a heating pad," Mr. Arndt said. "That heating pad is cooling down, but the buildup of its effects in recent months helped keep the ocean temperatures up."
The average land temperature in July was the second-warmest on record, the NOAA scientists said. The average land temperature world-wide was 2.21 degrees F above the 20th-century average of 57.8 degrees F.

Full text: More than 20 states are suing the Trump administration over its rollback of climate-change regulations for power plants in what could be a landmark case deciding what the federal government's responsibility is for fighting global warming.
New York is taking the lead, joined by California and others claiming that the federal government is abdicating its responsibilities under the Clean Air Act. In all, 22 states, the District of Columbia and six cities are filing suit, saying new rules the Environmental Protection Agency approved in June violate the law by eliminating requirements that would have reduced the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause climate change by effectively forcing coal-fired plants to close.
The suit is the latest pushback by several Democratic-led states that say the Trump administration's policies are endangering the environment. The Republican administration has been rolling back policies, especially climate policy under Democratic President Obama, that it says hinder development and push environmental laws beyond their intended purpose.
"Without significant course correction, we are careening towards a climate disaster," New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. "Rather than staying the course with policies aimed at fixing the problem and protecting people's health, safety, and the environment, the Trump Administration repealed the Clean Power Plan and replaced it."
An EPA representative said the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. The agency "worked diligently to ensure we produced a solid rule, that we believe will be upheld in the courts, unlike the previous Administration's Clean Power Plan," an EPA statement said.
The Obama-era Clean Power Plan had been blocked by legal challenges from 26 states, industry groups and others that cited concerns including the costs of compliance and the EPA's authority to enact such a sweeping change. President Trump's EPA responded by replacingit with its Affordable Clean Energy rules. They aim to give more authority to states and allow even coal-fired plants to remain in operation if they adopt newer, more efficient technology.
Tuesday's lawsuit reignites a legal fight about climate change. The Supreme Court has already weighed in, saying in 2007 that carbon dioxide -- the leading cause of climate change -- is a pollutant the EPA can regulate under the Clean Air Act. Details of how far the EPA can go remains under question, leading the high court to intervene again in 2016, temporarily blocking Mr. Obama's plan.
The Trump administration responded to the court by limiting EPA power in several ways. Most prominently, rules it set in June allow the agency to regulate only "inside the fence-line" of each power plant, with EPA leaders saying that is all the authority the Clean Air Act grants them. Their rules established a menu of technological options each individual plant can choose from.
Experts expect the challenge to those rules could put climate-change issues in front of the high court again. They expect a decision could take years, or that the Trump policy could be vacated if Mr. Trump loses re-election.
The states behind the new suit are pushing a return to the Clean Power Plan and argue it better reflects the responsibilities given to the EPA by the Clean Air Act. That question never received an ultimate judgment by the high court.
New York and its allies say the replacement doesn't meet a Clean Air Act requirement for rules that would have power plants employ the "best system" of emissions reduction. They say cross-state, market-based trading programs had proved to be an effective system for cutting emissions.

Full text: Energy companies are producing record volumes of natural gas, thanks in part to the U.S. fracking boom. They have ambitious plans to make the cleaner-burning fuel a big part of the global energy mix for decades to come by sending tankers of liquefied gas around the world.
But growing public concern over leaks and intentional releases of gas and its primary component, methane, threaten to derail the dominance of gas in the new energy world order.
Methane is far more potent than carbon dioxide in contributing to climate change. That makes it particularly harmful to the environment when it is discharged into the atmosphere.
In the U.S. alone, the methane that leaks or is released from oil and gas operations annually is equivalent to the greenhouse-gas emissions from more than 69 million cars, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis using conversion formulas from the Environmental Protection Agency and emissions estimates for 2015 published last year in the journal Science.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body, says methane is even more potent than the estimates the EPA uses. By its calculation the annual releases would be equal to those of about 94 million cars, or roughly a third of the nation's registered vehicles.
About 2.3% of the natural gas produced in the U.S. escapes directly into the atmosphere due in part to leaky equipment or intentional discharges, according to the Science study, which analyzed 2015 emissions. (Some discharges are legally permitted.) At that rate, it would have amounted to about $7.6 million worth of gas lost each day last year.
Another roughly $4.5 million in U.S. gas went up in smoke each day in 2018, World Bank data show, as energy companies burned fuel they couldn't move to market or chose not to ship because the cost of doing so would have exceeded the price the gas would fetch in some regions. Many companies drill primarily for oil and treat the gas released in the process as a byproduct.
The practice of burning off gas, known as flaring, also contributes to climate change, though less so because methane produces carbon dioxide when burned, and carbon dioxide is less harmful to the environment in the near term.
Leaking and flaring are a global problem. As gas displaces coal for electricity production in the U.S. and other countries its side effects are drawing more attention, not just from environmental activists but investors fretting about how gas will compete over the long term against renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which are dropping in price.
President Trump's administration has moved to relax existing federal requirements for monitoring and fixing leaks. Still, from oil giants to the independent drillers powering the shale boom, companies are scrambling to rein in emissions over concerns from their executives, shareholders and environmentalists that gas waste could undermine the argument for gas as the "bridge fuel" to a cleaner future of renewables.
"It is clearly an issue not only for BP but for the entire energy business," said David Lawler, chief executive of BP PLC's U.S. onshore business.
Methane is invisible to the naked eye, so companies detect leaks with infrared cameras and lasers. That can be a tall task -- the gas can seep out of countless places, from wells to pipelines to storage facilities.
As a result, energy companies are increasingly supplementing manual inspections with aerial monitoring to survey large swaths of land checkerboarded with oil and gas infrastructure.
In West Texas, BP has begun monthly flights over its wells by a drone equipped with methane-detection equipment. The flights generate data on the location and size of leaks that BP uses to identify faulty equipment and direct repairs.
The company also is looking to cut back on flaring, which many companies do in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico because they lack access to pipelines to move the product to market.
About 18% of the gas produced on BP's acreage in the Permian was either flared or released directly into the air during this year's first quarter, compared with an average of 5% across the region, according to a Rystad Energy analysis of public data. That period includes two months in which BHP Group Ltd., the prior owner, was operating the wells.
BP is investing in a new gas-gathering and compression system that will allow it to send more gas to customers instead of burning it away.
"We all have to get better," said Brian Pugh, chief innovation officer for BP's U.S. onshore business. The company said it has already hit its target of limiting methane emissions, both unintended and intentional, to 0.2% of the total gas it sells. BP, like many of its peers, doesn't include emissions from assets it doesn't operate in its figures.
Another way companies can reduce leaks is by rethinking facilities so they have fewer potential places for gas to escape.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC is building central processing facilities in West Texas that take in oil and gas from large groups of wells. There, the company separates the gas from oil, compresses it, removes oxygen and sends it through a pipeline to market.
The additional infrastructure helps Shell ensure the gas is up to the pipeline's specifications and doesn't have to be released or burned.
The company hopes such measures can help it achieve its target: similar to BP, it aims to reduce methane leaks and intentional releases to less than 0.2% of the overall gas sold from its operations by 2025. Shell declined to provide a companywide baseline but said its 2018 methane emissions rate in the Permian was 0.29%.
Shell, like others, also has pledged to eliminate what it calls routine flaring by 2030.
"The more centralized you are, the less venting and flaring," said Amir Gerges, the company's general manager for the Permian.
As more companies monitor methane emissions, it is spurring the formation of startups focused on leak detection and management.
Kairos Aerospace, a Mountain View, Calif.-based company, specializes in identifying larger methane releases by flying small planes about 3,000 feet above the ground. Together, the planes typically traverse more than 150 square miles a day in the Permian. Kairos sells the data to operators below, such as shale driller Pioneer Natural Resources Co.
Kairos has received funding from the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, an industry organization whose members include Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. The companies in the organization have pledged to collectively cut average methane emissions to less than 0.25% of gas sold by 2025.
"A very small number of facilities are actually leaking a significant amount of methane," said Kairos Chief Executive Steve Deiker.
One reason companies are stepping up monitoring is that environmental activists are watching, using technology to record leaks as they seek to boost public awareness of methane emissions.
Sharon Wilson, an organizer for the advocacy group Earthworks, visits the Permian almost every month to monitor leaks from oil and gas sites, using a hand-held infrared camera. She submits the footage as evidence in state regulatory complaints against energy companies and often posts it on YouTube.
"Nobody's watching, so they [the companies] can take all the shortcuts they want to," Ms. Wilson said during a recent monitoring trip through the Permian. Still, the activists believe they are having an impact.
Earthworks has filed more than 100 complaints in Texas and New Mexico since the beginning of 2018. State regulators issued violations or compelled operators to make repairs or install new equipment in fewer than 10% of the instances as of July, according to estimates by the group.
Bigger companies have been more outspoken about taking action on methane than smaller ones, because they tend to face more pressure from investors and activists. But some small and midsize shale drillers are taking steps to curb emissions.
Devon Energy Corp. said in June it plans to cut methane emissions to 0.28% of the gas it produces by 2025, from a 2018 baseline of 0.32%. To get there, it is stepping up environmental inspections and evaluating detection technologies.
The independent Oklahoma City-based driller said it set the target to help the environment and appeal to a growing number of funds on Wall Street that focus on socially responsible investing.
"That just helps us broaden our investor base," said Chris Kirt, who heads Devon's environmental, social and governance steering committee.

Full text: Climate experts meeting in Geneva recommended changes to the foods people eat and farm in an effort to stave off the disruptive effects of rising global temperatures, while growers and major food producers attempt to adapt.
People should consider eating more vegetables and less meat, the researchers said Thursday. The switch may help slow greenhouse-gas emissions, they said, because farming vegetables releases less greenhouse gases than livestock production.
"Diets that are rich in plant-based foods have lower greenhouse-gas emissions than diets heavy in red-meat consumption," said climatologist Cynthia Rosenzweig, who studies climate change and agriculture at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.
Farming and other land uses account for nearly a quarter of greenhouse-gas emissions, while half of the methane emissions in the atmosphere are released from cattle and rice fields, the researchers said. Other studies have found less of an impact on greenhouse-gas emissions but still sizable effects.
Some food manufacturers and agricultural companies are already taking steps to change practices.
Smithfield Foods Inc. has set a goal of reducing greenhouse emissions 25% by 2025 through moves like working with farmers to improve the efficiency of fertilizer use and crop yields, while reducing nitrous oxide emissions.
Mondelez International Inc., maker of Cadbury candy bars and other chocolate products, said farms in Ghana that participate in its cocoa sustainability program reported 15% higher yields for the commodity than nonparticipants.
More changes to farming are in the works. Big seed suppliers like Bayer AG, Corteva Inc. and Syngenta AG are developing varieties of corn that can grow in dry conditions and rice that can withstand saltier water. The companies say those plants can help farmers produce food as temperatures and sea levels rise.
Agribusinesses are also touting genetically engineered crops and synthetic pesticides as the best way to maximize crop production and minimize deforestation and tilling, which can release carbon into the atmosphere. In 2015, scientists developed a genetically modified rice that gives off virtually no greenhouse-gas emissions while growing; there isn't an estimate on when it might be ready for market. At least one agriculture tech startup is testing soy, camelina and corn crops whose DNA was edited to lower their emissions and adapt the plants to climate change.
"Farmers that use the best technologies and agronomic approaches significantly reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions," Erik Fyrwald, Syngenta's chief executive, said in a recent interview.
Plant-based meat replacement products could spur an increase in vegetable consumption and a drop in eating beef, say companies like Beyond Meat Inc. and Impossible Foods Inc. Making imitation ground beef using proteins from yellow peas or soy requires less grain production and water, and could help curb emissions from livestock themselves, the companies say.
Big restaurant companies including Burger King, Dunkin' Brands Group Inc. and Carl's Jr. have added Beyond and Impossible meat substitutes at thousands of U.S. restaurants in the past year.
The latest round of attention followed the release of a report on climate change and land use by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, a United Nations body that evaluates climate-change science for government policy makers.
The IPCC is an advisory group composed of climate scientists from around the world who regularly review climate-change research and provide scientific assessments of the implications and risks of changing climate conditions.
The report adds to a body of evidence highlighting the climate impact of livestock and crop production and the global appetite for red meat and rice. The impact from farming and diet is often overshadowed by debates about curbing heat-trapping carbon emissions from fossil fuels.
"We weren't just concerned about agriculture but about the way that people eat and the implications of that for climate change and greenhouse-gas emissions," said Jim Skea, an energy strategy fellow at Imperial College London and co-chairman of the IPCC working group.
Last year was the fourth-warmest year since 1880, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which track annual climate trends.

Full text: Tom Steyer became a billionaire by managing a hedge fund whose expansive portfolio included investments in oil, gas and coal companies. Then he became one of the Democratic Party's most important donors, pouring $350 million into causes such as fighting climate change.
Now, the 62-year-old who built his fortune analyzing risk and probability is mounting a long-shot bid for president.
He plans to fund his White House ambitions with $100 million of his fortune, which Forbes has estimated to be $1.6 billion. The former Goldman Sachs trader amassed his wealth through Farallon Capital Management LLC, a hedge fund he founded in 1986 and ran for 27 years. That hasn't stopped him from decrying the influence of big money in politics.
"I believe our democracy is corrupted by corporate money, and the only way to bring real change is from the outside by giving more power to the American people," Mr. Steyer said in a statement. "That's why I'm running for President."
Farallon started as a $9 million risk arbitrage shop in San Francisco, wagering on companies going through mergers and takeovers. By 2007, it was one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, managing more than $37 billion. Its portfolio included billions in stocks and debt, malls and housing developments in the U.S. and exposure to other investment funds. During Mr. Steyer's tenure, it also lent more than $1 billion to coal-mining projects in Asia.
Those and other energy investments would bring negative media attention to Mr. Steyer as he became a well-known climate-change activist.
Several clients who are close to Mr. Steyer said they didn't expect him to invest their money according to his politics. A former employee said Farallon cast a wide net for profits and "it would have to be pretty exceptional in terms of its pejorative impact for Farallon to have avoided it."
Farallon declined to comment on that characterization.
Mr. Steyer had been a reliable Democratic donor since the 1980s, according to a review of Federal Election Commission reports. He stepped up his involvement as a fundraiser during John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign.
Though Mr. Kerry lost, the experience sparked a growing interest in politics in Mr. Steyer, who colleagues said seemed restless after nearly two decades helming Farallon.
Advisers spent the next year reviewing where Mr. Steyer could have impact outside Farallon. They decided on founding a community development bank with his wife Kat Taylor, a longtime liberal activist. Around 2006, Mr. Steyer began holding focus groups to evaluate how he might be perceived if he ever ran, one person familiar with the matter said.
Clients by then were asking how long Mr. Steyer would remain involved at Farallon, said people familiar with the firm.
The financial crisis put any political aspirations on hold.
Farallon lost 36% in 2008 as investments in real estate, emerging markets like Turkey and Russia, and other areas soured. It was forced to set aside and sell off about $6 billion in assets so it could return cash to investors over time, rather than immediately. Mr. Steyer stayed on until Farallon stabilized.
He wrote to clients in 2012 he planned to focus on giving back and named as his successor Andrew Spokes, who had headed the unit that financed the coal projects. Mr. Steyer averaged a strong 13.4% annual return during his tenure, said people familiar with Farallon.
People close to Mr. Steyer said he had been increasingly conflicted, wanting to invest in a way that reflected his concerns about climate change but running a firm that invested agnostically for clients. Mr. Steyer had Farallon start a "green" fund for his money that avoids fossil-fuel investments.
His transition from donor to full-fledged political benefactor had begun a few years earlier, when San Francisco-based Democratic operative Chris Lehane asked him in 2007 to help kill a proposed California ballot initiative to apportion the state's presidential electors in a way that would have benefited Republican nominees.
Mr. Steyer spent $1 million on that campaign, and two years later $5 million to defeat a proposition that would have overturned a California law to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. He won those and two later ballot-initiative battles, spending $50 million total.

Full text: Unchecked climate change could mean that the weather conditions hurting farmers this year will become increasingly common and result in higher costs for the federal government, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report.
The report, issued by the USDA's Economic Research Service found that if greenhouse gases are allowed to continue to increase, U.S. production of corn and soybeans -- which are more susceptible to extreme heat during growing season -- could decline as much as 80% in the next 60 years.
As a result, corn and soybean prices would skyrocket in that period, as would the cost of crop insurance. According to the study, the cost of crop insurance to the federal government could rise to $7.6 billion a year for corn and $3.3 billion for soybeans. By comparison, the USDA has spent roughly $300 million on insurance for the 2019 crop year as of July 15.
Federally subsidized crop insurance covers as much as 85% of a farmers' acres against natural disasters or declines in commodity prices. The government subsidizes 62% of the insurance premium on average.
"We show in the report that the cost of the crop insurance program will increase with global warming," said Andrew Crane-Droesch, a research economist with the ERS and one of the authors of the report.
Last year was the fourth-warmest year on record since 1880, according to a February report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The hottest year was 2016, followed by 2017 and 2015, with 2014 as the fifth hottest on record.
Data from the Environmental Protection Agency show that gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions rose 1.3% from 1990 to 2017. However, emissions shot up 3.4% in 2018, attributed to a surge in the economy. It was the largest jump in emissions since 2010.
The ERS study examined five climate models using three projections of emissions -- one where there is no mitigation of emissions, another with some mitigation, and keeping them at their current level. Computer simulations were then run to play out the models with the different emission levels from 2060 to 2099.
Midwest farmers are being punished by adverse weather this year. Extremely wet weather this spring left many unable to fully plant their crops, and now summertime heat could kill a sizable portion of the plants that managed to sprout. The USDA is still determining how many acres will be left unplanted as a result of this year's tough weather, but estimates place unplanted acres as high as 15 million for corn -- well above the 2013 record of 3.6 million corn acres.
Grain prices have risen since weather problems during the planting season began to surface in May. Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade have risen 16% since May 1, while soybean futures are up 3%. According to Mr. Crane-Droesch, the models used by the ERS show that farmers are in for more difficult springs as climate change gets more severe.

Full text: PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. -- First, the Dungeness crabs were poisoned. Then gray whales started turning up dead. Most recently, record numbers of Guadalupe fur seals and California sea lions are washing up starving and sick.
The West Coast this year has seen an unusually high number of marine animal deaths, sending scientists scrambling to understand why. The leading theories all have one factor in common: warming waters caused by climate change.
"These animals are really indicator species for ocean health, they're the ones that are showing us right here from shore that there's something wrong out there," said Shawn Johnson, director of veterinary sciences at the Marine Mammal Center.
The Marine Mammal Center has rescued 370 California sea lions so far this year and 207 in June alone, a record for a year without extreme weather events.
In addition, 103 gray whales have been found dead on the West Coast so far this year -- the most since 2000, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The stakes go beyond the health of the species that have washed up on shore. The ailments of larger marine mammals like whales and sea lions could be the first signs of maladies affecting fish that people depend on for food, marine experts say. NOAA has declared the whale deaths an unusual mortality event, which triggers the agency to take immediate action out of fear it could have more severe repercussions.
In the past, increases in animal deaths have often been tied to El Nino, the irregular weather system that warms waters along the West Coast when it occurs every two to seven years. Warmer water is typically less dense with nutrients, leading to more animal deaths from starvation.
Strandings of Guadalupe fur seals and California sea lions have been on the decline since 2015, the last year in which there was a strong El Nino.
"We thought, 'Wow, we're in the clear,' and then this year we got hit again," Dr. Johnson said.
This year's El Nino has been weak, which points to warming waters caused by climate change as a cause, oceanic experts said.
Another factor in the animal deaths possibly tied to climate change is domoic acid poisoning, caused by algae blooms that thrive in warmer waters. All of the adult sea lions rescued by the Marine Mammal Center in the past month suffered from domoic acid poisoning, Dr. Johnson said.
More Dungeness crabs have also been found with domoic acid poisoning in the past several years, prompting the California Department of Public Health to issue advisories for the species and to ban fishing of them at times. Domoic acid can cause lethargy, disorientation, seizures and eventually death in humans.

Trump to Nominate
New Operations Chief
President Trump will nominate Navy Vice Adm. Mike Gilday to be the next chief of naval operations, three U.S. officials said, after the confirmed nominee, Adm. Bill Moran, was ousted this week over an ethics issue.
Adm. Gilday and other Navy officials met late Wednesday with Mr. Trump at the White House and Mr. Trump gave the nod to the nomination, one official said. Adm. Gilday was recently appointed to be the director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, and had been in that job for only a matter of months.
In recommending a three-star admiral to be the next chief of naval operations, Navy Secretary Richard Spencer is picking a relatively junior officer to lead the Navy, bypassing a number of four-star admirals. But officials said Adm. Gilday, who was a senior aide to former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen and has a background in cybersecurity, was a viable pick.

SOCIAL MEDIA
White House Hosts
Summit For Allies
A "Social Media Summit" at the White House this week will offer a platform for supporters of President Trump who say they face censorship by left-tilting Big Tech -- and a preview of a likely theme in Mr. Trump's re-election campaign.
Attendees include the Claremont Institute think tank, media company Prager University and the Media Research Center, a nonprofit critical of national news organizations. Also expected to attend are more familiar Washington conservatives, including the Heritage Foundation.
Not on the guest list: Facebook Inc., which said it didn't get an invitation. Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc., which owns YouTube and Google, also weren't invited, according to people familiar with the situation.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Analyst Resigns
Over Testimony Curb
A State Department intelligence analyst resigned in protest after the White House blocked portions of his written testimony to a congressional panel to exclude data and evidence on climate change and its threat to national security, State Department officials said.
The analyst, Rod Schoonover, prepared a written report citing scientific journal articles and intelligence reports that conclude that climate change could have wide-ranging national-security impacts by contributing to increased humanitarian crises, competition for resources and risk of political instability.
White House officials allowed him to speak to the panel in June but prohibited him from including evidence and data supporting his assessments in written testimony to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence last month, according to one of the officials familiar with the matter.
A State Department representative said "we do not comment on personnel matters."

NEW YORK CITY
World Cup Winners
Feted With Parade
Adoring fans packed New York City's Canyon of Heroes on Wednesday amid a blizzard of confetti to praise the World Cup-winning U.S. women's national soccer team as athletic leaders on the field -- and as advocates for pay equity off it.
Crowds chanted "USA! USA!" and workers sounded air horns from a construction site as the parade moved up a stretch of lower Broadway that has long hosted so-called ticker tape parades for world leaders, veterans and hometown sports stars. The team sealed its second consecutive tournament win by beating the Netherlands 2-0 on Sunday.
After chants for "Equal pay!" from the crowd, U.S. Soccer Federation President Carlos Cordeiro said women "deserve fair and equitable pay. And together I believe we can get this done."

Full text: Companies that have been on the wrong side of the social-impact movement are trying to convince investors to take another look. And for some investors, at least, it's working.
Devarsh Ruparelia, a student at the University of Illinois who considers himself an ethically focused investor, added tobacco company Altria Group Inc. to his portfolio when its stock hit recent lows in January.
That's not normally the case: Investors who incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards in their selection process often avoid tobacco stocks. But Mr. Ruparelia was won over by Altria's heavy investment in e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. "Smoke-free products like Juul and IQOS are the future," he says.
More broadly, he says, "it is not a good idea to screen out opportunities just because those companies are seen as sinners, since some of these companies are not just open to change but are taking already steps to improve."
Indeed, a growing number of companies across the spectrum of industries that traditionally raise red flags with ESG investors are acting to improve their image and their business prospects by shifting toward less-harmful products and addressing corporate-governance issues.
Pressure for that kind of change is growing. In 2018, U.S. money managers reported that they applied climate-related restrictions to $3 trillion in assets, tobacco-related restrictions to $2.9 trillion, weapons-related restrictions to $1.9 trillion and alcohol-related restrictions to $1.5 trillion, according to data from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, a group of organizations that promote sustainable investment.
And just as investors in big numbers are turning away from certain companies because of ESG concerns, many consumers are favoring companies and products that they consider to be more socially responsible. That means a company that doesn't move toward more-responsible products and operations risks losing both investors and market share. Some companies also run the risk that tougher regulation could subject them to hefty fines and/or major expenses in bringing their business into line with the rules.
"If a company ignores the risks it is facing, this will impact quite negatively on the financial side," says Amelia Sexton, an investment manager at Holden & Partners, a financial adviser in London.
Facing those risks, some of the biggest tobacco companies are positioning themselves for a cigarette-free future.
In December, Altria invested almost $13 billion for a 35% stake in Juul, amid an accelerating decline of cigarette sales and the failure of Altria's own e-cigarette brands to gain traction in the market. Altria's chief executive, Howard Willard, described the move as the biggest in the company's history toward achieving a reduction in the harm done by tobacco.
Similarly, Philip Morris International Inc., the largest of the international tobacco companies, is going through the biggest strategic transformation in its history. Since 2008, when it was spun off by Altria, it has spent $6 billion developing next-generation products it says are less harmful than traditional cigarettes, including a device called IQOS that heats tobacco for inhalation instead of burning it.
"We want no more cigarettes on the planet in 20 years from now," says Huub Savelkouls, chief sustainability officer at Philip Morris International. Smokers and regulators will have a role to play in achieving that goal as well as tobacco companies, he says, but "we are ready for it; 92% of our R&D expenditure is dedicated to our smoke-free vision. We are ready to go as fast as possible."
Both Juul and IQOS have been criticized. Juul has been blamed by public-health officials for contributing to a surge in teen vaping in the U.S. And last month, Philip Morris International suspended all of its product-related digital influencer actions after Reuters asked the company about its use of online personalities as young as one woman who gave her age as 21 to promote IQOS. The company told Reuters that its own guidance called for influencers to be at least 25. "While no laws were broken, we fell short of the high standards we set for ourselves," says a spokesman for Philip Morris International.
Altria, Juul and Philip Morris International all say that they support raising the minimum age for buying tobacco and vaping products to 21, and that they market their products only to adult smokers.
Auto makers are also under tremendous pressure, in their case to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and have responded by ramping up their development of electric vehicles. Volkswagen AG, the world's largest auto maker, was a pariah of ESG investors when the scandal over the company's misreporting of diesel emissions blew up in 2015. But since then Volkswagen has focused on developing battery-powered vehicles and hybrids.
Volkswagen plans to spend more than <euro>30 billion ($33.6 billion) developing electric vehicles and <euro>50 billion on battery technology and production over the next five years. It expects at least two in five cars it sells to be fully electric by 2030, and many analysts say Volkswagen will soon be the largest manufacturer of electric cars. The company also says it hopes to be carbon-neutral by 2050.
Climate concerns also drive the aversion of many ESG investors to oil companies. Despite oil companies' recent investments in the development of renewable energy, spending on alternative energies by the oil and gas sector was still modest at $22 billion world-wide in 2018, according to CDP, a U.K.-based nonprofit that works with companies to help them disclose their environmental impact.
In some cases, pressure for faster change in the industry is being exerted directly -- and effectively -- by shareholders. For example, BP PLC shareholders approved a climate resolution in May that commits the British oil-and-gas company to set out a business strategy consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which requires nations to strengthen their actions to limit global warming.
BP followed Royal Dutch Shell, which last year became the first major oil and gas company to commit to curbing emissions from its products, in response to pressure from a European group of 4,600 shareholders in the oil and gas sector.
Inclusion initiatives
Companies are working on revamping their operations as well as their products.
Diageo, the owner of Guinness, Baileys, Johnnie Walker and other brands of alcohol, has gained a place in some portfolios with its commitment to gender diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
"The research and evidence is compelling, and the value added to business performance is clear at Diageo -- gender-balanced businesses perform better," says Mairead Nayager, Diageo's chief human-resources officer. "We see fostering an environment where everybody is valued irrespective of their gender, background, religion, sexuality, ethnicity, experiences, thinking styles and more as crucial to our long-term success."
Women make up 40% of Diageo's executive committee and 34% of its senior leadership team. The company aims to have its senior leadership be 40% women by 2025.
"I admire Diageo," says Anne Tolmunen, lead portfolio manager of the AXA Women Empowerment fund, which invests in companies that promote gender diversity and women leadership. About 2.3% of the nearly $80 million fund is invested in Diageo.
Diageo also is investing in programs to address alcohol misuse and drunken driving, and aims to have one million people trained as what it calls responsible-drinking ambassadors by 2020. These are adults Diageo has trained to promote moderation.

Full text: LONDON -- The plastic backlash has a new target: Happy Meal toys.
A British petition calling for McDonald's Corp. to scrap the plastic toys included with kids' meals has garnered over 325,000 signatures, and the country's environment minister is pressing the case.
The rising scrutiny shows how concerns about the environmental impacts of plastic are broadening from single-use products, like straws and coffee cups, to items some view as unnecessary or short-lived. The focus is no longer just on waste, but also the impact production has on climate change.
Many toys, including those in Happy Meals, typically can't be recycled because they are made of multiple kinds of plastic, or plastic mixed with other materials. Parents say these often end up in the trash.
"You open a plastic bag to get another plastic item, which is played with for five minutes and then probably goes in the bin," said Rachael Wood, whose daughters Ella and Caitlin, ages 10 and 7, started the petition late last year. The petition also targets Burger King.
McDonald's last year set up a global working group to study environmental issues related to its Happy Meal packaging and toys, Elaine Strunk, its head of global sustainability, said in an interview. Through the group, the fast-food chain is exploring ways to make its toys from a single type of plastic so they can more easily be recycled, and is researching whether some renewable materials could be used in place of plastic for its toys, she said.
In the U.K., McDonald's said last month it would swap out two hard plastic toys for books for a six-to-eight-week period. It will also include some soft toys and board games in the second half of this year, amounting to a 60% reduction in hard plastic compared with the first six months.
The change took concerns about plastic into consideration but was based on a variety of factors, including the popularity of the books, and was decided before the petition surfaced, according to a spokeswoman.
"Given the focus on plastics you probably will see a bit more of a mix going forward," she said, adding McDonald's hasn't made a long-term commitment to scale back on plastic tied to its Happy Meals.
A spokeswoman for Burger King, which offers plastic toys with its King Jr kids' meals, said the company is working on developing "alternative toy solutions," declining to provide details.
Britain has become a hot spot for plastic concerns, with some measures to cut waste here later rolled out to other markets. In September, McDonald's replaced plastic straws with paper across its 1,361 restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland. It is now testing alternatives to plastic straws in the U.S. and elsewhere.
McDonald's recently removed plastic lids from McFlurry ice creams and moved to cardboard containers for salads in the U.K., one of its most established international markets.
In Japan, McDonald's surveyed Japanese mothers, finding many wanted to recycle their children's used toys but didn't know how. It collected 1.27 million used plastic toys through boxes in 2,900 restaurants during a 10-week trial last year, recycling these into trays for its restaurants. Ms. Strunk said the company is researching ways to scale this and make it permanent.
When the Happy Meal hit the U.S. market in 1979, it was intended as a short promotion. Executives worried about the complexity of additional menu items and toys, recalls Colleen Fahey, a consultant who worked on the launch. But families loved it and a subsequent partnership with Walt Disney Co. made the toys a huge draw.
Over time the Happy Meal got a bad rap for marketing fast food to children. McDonald's has been trying to make it more nutritious, by adding water and fruit, among other moves.
Plastic concerns are a newer challenge. U.K. Environment Minister Therese Coffey last year publicly called for McDonald's to scrap plastic toys in Happy Meals and has since met with the company. "Every nudge will help," she told The Wall Street Journal last week.
Petitions in previous years in various countries, calling on companies to stop handing out plastic toys, haven't gotten much traction.
Ms. Wood said her daughters' petition attracted so much interest because awareness about plastic waste is high. "It's come at a time when people are suddenly having a lightbulb moment."
Late last year, Ms. Wood helped her daughters create the petition online following discussions in school, which she says stoked their awareness about the impact plastic products were having on the environment. The girls told her what they wanted to say in the petition after visiting McDonald's and put a poster in a window at their home saying "down with plastic," said Ms. Wood.
While Wendy's Co. and Sonic Corp., which operates a drive-in hamburger chain, also give away toys with children's meals, others have scrapped the practice. In 2011, hamburger chain Jack in the Box stopped including toys with its meals, and in 2013, Taco Bell stopped offering toys and kids' meals in the U.S.
Some companies have batted away concerns about plastic toys. Italian candy maker Ferrero International SA, which distributes over 3.5 billion plastic toys in its chocolate Kinder eggs every year, describes its toys as an "integral and inseparable part of the product." These are "durable goods, not single-use plastics," a spokesman said.

Full text: BERLIN -- Natalie Mayer knows why Germans disdain the air conditioner, or the Klimaanlage -- literally, climate apparatus.
"People here don't like air conditioning. They think it's a waste of energy, it's bad for the environment, and people say it makes them sick," said Ms. Mayer, a Californian who has lived abroad for more than a decade, including the last four years in Berlin.
She also knows it's easy to be anti-A/C until getting punched in the face by 100-degree weather. Summer is barely a week old, and heat records in Germany are already getting busted right and left.
Ms. Mayer bought a portable air-conditioning unit for her office desk, setting off something of a tempest in a teapot among her colleagues.
"Everybody was curious. They would say, 'Does it work well?' And I said, 'Hey, why don't you sit in my seat and try it out,'" said Ms. Mayer, a business developer at retail startup Fit Analytics. Two co-workers bought their own.
Germans have always looked down on America's fondness for artificially chilled air as wasteful, unnatural and wimpy. Rather than install climate control in buildings and subways, schools and offices will simply close if it gets too hot. Now, the increasing frequency of triple-digit highs have forced a national reckoning.
Germany's Trade Association for Air Conditioning said that last summer, the second-warmest on record since 1881, yielded a 15% jump in sales to 200,000 units. That figure is expected to climb this summer, as more Germans rebel against the nation's obsession with energy conservation.
High temperatures are known to make people act out of character. Police in the German state of Brandenburg stopped a man riding naked on a motorcycle. He said it was too hot for clothes.
German authorities have even imposed speed limits on stretches of the Autobahn, fearing it could buckle like heated wax.
Old-fashioned oscillating fans have always been the preferred way for Germans to keep homes and offices cool. Property leases for apartments implore tenants to open their windows several times a day to help regulate temperature. A video from the German news magazine Focus, keeping to tradition, suggested a cooling method using "a fan, a towel, and a bowl of water."
Retailers fear a fan and air conditioner shortage this summer. Annabell Feith, a spokeswoman for the retail group that owns two of Germany's largest electronics stores, MediaMarkt and Saturn, said the chains were bolstering their orders. Last year, some stores sold out by August.
"We are advising customers, if they want to buy a fan, to be very quick, because we expect more heat," she said, "and we are almost sold out, especially in Berlin."
Bild, the country's best-selling tabloid, said Wednesday it would raffle 100 fans an hour to subscribers from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
At Adidas AG, the international sports-gear company based in Herzogenaurach, offices are "climate controlled" but still warm enough that employees are offered ice cream on hot days.
Employees also are allowed to work in shorts, T-shirts and sandals, said Claudia Lange, a company spokeswoman.
Cooling is spotty at U.S. firms with outposts in Germany. Facebook offices in Hamburg provided air conditioning in meeting rooms but not in the open spaces where staffers sit, a spokesman said.
Jesse Pinho, an American developer at Berlin-based menstrual cycle tracking app Clue, said he was surprised at the scarcity of air conditioning around the city. So he made an interactive map of public places with central air, mostly grocery stores and Starbucks.
The map, called KalteKarte, or Cold Map, racked up more than 75,000 views since its launch last summer.
The reaction, he said, has been hot and cold.
"I have gotten some criticism from people who are concerned about the effect of air conditioning on climate change, due to the extra power being consumed," Mr. Pinho said. "And this is a valid point: The very reason that Germany doesn't have A/C is that it never used to be this hot!"
Alexander Krex wrote a satirical essay last week for Hamburg-based newspaper Die Zeit, urging Germans to embrace the joy of energy-sucking air conditioners the same way they enjoy dialing up the heat in winter. "Why else do we have our world-famous engineers?" he wrote.
Another reason Germans have been reluctant to embrace air conditioning is a national conviction that any breeze can make you sick.
As temperatures soared this week, the German Red Cross urged the public to turn on all fans and open windows. "'Durchzug' is not harmful, only Germans believe that!" the agency tweeted.
No doubt, many people agree it is more comfortable. A study by the Freiburg-based Institute for Applied Ecology reported that the share of German homes with air conditioning could rise to as much as 13% by 2030 from 3% in 2015.
Enjoying the cooling effect, though, isn't so easy.
Birgit Herrmannek, 62, who owns a condominium outside of Frankfurt, wants to buy an air conditioner for herself. First, though, she had to navigate a 60-page manual of rules for property owners.
Despite the hurdles, which could include a face-to-face meeting with other condo residents, Ms. Herrmannek said she understood why there were restrictions:
"The boxes of the outside air conditioners do not look pretty."

Full text: SOMEWHERE IN IDAHO -- Four days after fleeing his home in Oregon, State Senator Cliff Bentz is still figuring out how to be a fugitive.
He has changed hotels twice (partly to keep down costs) and bought a burner cellphone (he's sure the authorities can track his regular phone). But on Sunday, he still hadn't set the burner up and was making calls on his usual cell.
"I don't think any of us have really been -- I hate to say on the lam, but . . ." Mr. Bentz said. "It's probably incorrect to be talking to you on this phone. They don't give classes on this."
Sen. Bentz and the 10 other Republicans in the Oregon Senate decamped the capital last week in an effort to block a landmark climate bill. Without at least two GOP members present, the Senate -- despite the Democratic supermajority -- doesn't have a quorum and can't pass the bill, which would create a statewide cap-and-trade system to limit carbon emissions.
Gov. Kate Brown has directed the Oregon State Police to find the rogue Republicans, who are now trying to adjust to life in hiding. The state constitution allows the majority party to "compel" the legislators to attend.
Tensions have grown so high since the senators disappeared that the state Capitol was shut down Saturday after threats from militia groups, the nature of which police didn't disclose. It opened again on Sunday, but the Democrats, lacking a quorum, still couldn't call a vote.
"They need to return and do the jobs they were elected to do," Gov. Brown, who supports the cap-and-trade bill, said on Thursday.
The state police's jurisdiction stops at the state line, and so the missing senators have fanned out across the Western U.S. to stay out of their grasp. Most have left the state, and refuse to say much about where they are. Mr. Bentz would say only that he was in Idaho.
Herman E. Baertschiger Jr., Oregon's Senate minority leader, wouldn't even say what state he was in. The answer became clear, however, when Mr. Baertschiger's phone died and he borrowed one from a colleague standing nearby: Mr. Bentz.
Idaho, the closest state controlled entirely by Republicans, is a popular destination for many in Oregon's GOP diaspora. Idaho state police have said they aren't involved in any search for the senators, because they haven't broken any laws in Idaho. As a result, Mr. Bentz decided he could relax some of the spycraft. "The hiding piece, I'm not taking that terrifically seriously," he said on his (non-burner) phone. "There's a lot of discussion about how you should wrap your phone in tin foil."
After cleaning out his Salem, Ore., apartment near the Capitol -- his lease, like the legislative session, ends on June 30 -- Republican State Sen. Tim Knopp spent Wednesday night in Oregon, then drove to Washington state on Thursday. He thought of staying there, but decided it wasn't safe.
"You have a Democratic governor in Washington running for president on climate change," he said, referring to Gov. Jay Inslee. "What better way to energize that campaign than to return intransigent Republicans so they can vote on climate change? I was like, I've got to get out of here."
He soon drove his Ford Fusion (a hybrid, he noted) across the border to Idaho. A friend set him up in a lakeside cabin, where a reporter from The Wall Street Journal visited on Sunday.
Though the accommodation is basic, he said he has everything he needs there to camp out as long as necessary. He watches the Oregon Senate sessions on his iPad, and has enough cell reception to talk to his 11-year-old daughter via Skype. He said he might change things up by sleeping in the tepee outside one night. There is just one thing he's missing. "In the rush to pack the car, the socks did not get there," he said. "So, I've got two pairs." There is a washing machine at the cabin.
The Oregon's Senate Republicans have joined a long tradition of American legislators who flee their states as a last resort to stop legislation. In recent years, as Republicans have taken control of a majority of legislatures across the country, the lawmakers on the lam have more often been Democrats.
In 2011, Democrats from both Wisconsin and Indiana ran to Illinois to stop legislatures in their states from passing bills that limited public-sector unions and collective-bargaining rights. Democrats fled Texas for Oklahoma in 2003, hoping to stop redistricting legislation.
In 2001, Oregon's Democratic state senators went into hiding to stop a Republican redistricting plan -- a history members of the current minority party invoke when defending their own unauthorized vacations.
Mr. Baertschiger, the Republican leader, said his members were determined to stay out of the state for as long as it took to get the concessions they wanted on the climate bill. "I don't know what that means in terms of time, but they're very dedicated," he said.
Ginny Burdick, the Oregon Senate majority leader, said the Democrats have been talking with Republicans but wouldn't compromise on the carbon cap-and-trade bill.
Gov. Brown has said she would call a special session, set to begin July 2, if the lawmakers don't return and finish their business this month. Creating a special session could keep Republicans on the run.
Mr. Bentz, the assistant Republican leader, said he was potentially prepared to stay away for months, but was already feeling the financial effects of his time away from home. In addition to the $500 a day fines the governor has imposed on all senators who aren't there, he has a small farm at home, and he has no one to help irrigate it while he's gone. "The little crop of hay and stuff that I raise is burning up," he said.

Building Collapse
Kills at Least 19
Rrescuers combing through the rubble of a collapsed seven-story building recovered the bodies of 19 construction workers and pulled out 24 injured, as authorities questioned four Chinese who were involved with the project.
Construction workers said the unfinished building in the coastal city of Sihanoukville doubled as their housing, with the crew spending nights on the second floor. Nhor Chandeun and his wife were asleep when at around 4 a.m. on Saturday they heard a loud noise and the building crumbled on top of them.
The Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training said that 30 workers were at the site when the building collapsed, but Nhor Chandeun said there were about 55-60 people inside the building.
Yun Min, the governor of Preah Sihanouk province, said the building was owned by a Chinese investor who leased land for a condominium -- one of many Chinese projects in the thriving beach resort.
Provincial authorities said in a statement that four Chinese nationals involved in the construction have been detained while an investigation into the collapse is carried out.
It wasn't immediately clear what caused the collapse.

UKRAINE
Thousands March
For LGBT Rights
Thousands of supporters of LGBT rights marched through the center of the capital Kiev, under a heavy police presence to separate them from opponents.
Police said nine people were arrested on suspicion of preparing provocations against participants in the Kiev Pride event.
Ukrainian news reports estimated the number of marchers at about 2,500.
Several people protesting the march scuffled with police as the it assembled. Others stood along the route, shouting and holding a banner reading "Sodomy is the road to hell."

GERMANY
Climate Activists
End Mine Blockade
Hundreds of climate activists ended their protest inside one of Germany's biggest open-pit mines after police repeatedly ordered them to leave, citing life-threatening danger, and authorities pulled some protesters out.
The Garzweiler lignite coal mine has been the focal point of environmental protests in Germany's Rhineland region since Friday, when 40,000 students rallied for more government action against climate change in the nearby city of Aachen.
The long-planned protests began hours after European Union leaders failed at a summit to agree on how to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050.
The mine has been the focus of many protests in recent years because the operator, German utility company RWE, planned to cut down a forest to enlarge it.

RUSSIA
Moscow Halts Flights
To Georgia in Protest
Thousands of demonstrators crowded outside Georgia's parliament on Saturday for the third straight day of protests that kindled tensions in the country and prompted Russia to block air connections with its neighbor.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the interior minister over harsh tactics by police in breaking up a rally on Thursday in which at least 240 people were injured. The speaker of parliament resigned on Friday.
The protests were ignited by the appearance of a Russian delegation in the Georgian parliament as part of an assembly of legislators from Orthodox Christian countries. Animosity toward Russia is strong in the wake of the 2008 war in which Georgia lost control of two Russia-backed separatist territories.
In response to the anti-Russia protests, President Vladimir Putin on Friday ordered Russia's airlines to stop taking its citizens to Georgia as of July 8.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration moved to try to revive the coal-power industry Wednesday, overturning Obama administration policies aimed at stemming climate change and adopting rules that could allow older power plants to continue operating.
The new plan, signed by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, replaces rules that sought to mandate a national shift away from coal to cleaner sources of power, including natural gas, wind and solar. The EPA move faced immediate pushback from environmental groups and some state and city governments.
The Obama-era rules had been blocked by legal challenges from 26 states, industry groups and others that cited concerns including the costs of compliance and the EPA's authority to enact such a sweeping change. Mr. Wheeler said the new rules will restore authority to states, but require some power plants to adopt newer technology to remain in operation.
"These provisions will give states and the private sector the regulatory certainty they need to invest in new technologies that are more efficient and reduce emissions," Mr. Wheeler said. "We are trying to address climate change. But we are trying to do it within the authority Congress has given us."
The EPA estimates the plan will help shrink power plants' carbon-dioxide emissions 35% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, but acknowledges that almost all the improvement will come from actions the industry takes on its own.
Environmentalists say the new rules don't go nearly far enough at a time when the risks of climate change are becoming more pronounced. A U.N. panel last year said that to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, global emissions would likely have to fall at nearly double the rate that the Trump administration's new plan estimates will happen in the U.S. power industry.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the EPA's new rules "disgraceful and immoral." He intends to sue to stop the plan, as does New York, and the two states have been working as part of a coalition of more than a dozen states and some of the country's largest cities to fight this and other Trump administration environmental policies.
EPA officials say it is unfair to make comparisons to the Obama-administration rules because they got hung up in court and never went into effect. Mr. Wheeler said he anticipates lawsuits, but expects to defend them and win.
Even with the Obama-era plan on hold, the power industry kept closing coal-fired plants, in part due to the declining cost of other power sources. U.S. coal consumption reached a 39-year-low of 687 million tons in 2018, and is set to fall further to 602 million tons in 2019 and 567 million tons in 2020, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated this month.
The power sector is by far the largest U.S. consumer of coal, using 636.5 million tons last year, the EIA said.
If the regulatory changes survive legal challenges, they could prolong the life of some older coal-fired plants as well as natural-gas plants that would otherwise have faced escalating expenses to comply with environmental mandates.
Those plants remain under fierce economic pressure. Newer, combined-cycle natural-gas plants produce power more efficiently, and wind power has become a strong competitor to coal in much of the U.S. heartland. Natural gas creates half of the emissions of coal, and has become the nation's top source of electricity since a drilling boom sent its price plummeting.
Meantime, power companies are rapidly adopting zero-carbon generation from wind and solar. Industry leaders say it is what consumers and investors want, and many say the largest power companies are unlikely to embrace coal again even with the sea change at the EPA.
The Obama-era plan had projected power-plant carbon-dioxide emissions would fall 32% from 2005 to 2030. The industry has been outpacing that, with emissions down 28% from 2005 through 2017, according to federal data.
Utilities in the Edison Electric Institute, the largest industry trade group, are on pace to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions 50% by 2030 from 2005 levels. The companies cover more than 70% of the country's electricity consumers.
The new rules work by limiting the EPA in several ways, most prominently by allowing the agency to regulate only "inside the fence-line" of each plant, the EPA says. It will create a menu of technological options each individual plant can choose from to boost efficiency.
Further, the rules put the agency in the back seat and the states in front. States will have the authority to design plans for power plants within their borders, with three years to craft and submit those plans to the EPA for approval.
A number of the states that fought the Obama-era policies were seeking to save jobs at coal mines and power plants within their borders. Many of those states lean heavily Republican, and President Trump became a fierce advocate for them, promising he would do what he could to support coal and other fossil-fuel producers.

Full text: A new study -- based partly on declassified spy-satellite data -- found that glaciers in the Himalayas were losing volume at much faster rates in recent years, adding more evidence suggesting that a changing climate is affecting an important water source.
The rate at which Himalayan glaciers lost volume more than doubled between 2000 and 2016, compared with the rate between 1975 and 2000, according to the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.
The study attributes the glacial retreat to higher temperatures, which were about one degree Celsius warmer for the 2000-to-2016 time frame.
Its findings echo results from other research indicating that climate change is forcing the retreat of glaciers around the world, which researchers say threatens to raise sea levels, trigger flooding and, over the long term, shrink water supplies. Almost two billion people living near the Himalayan glaciers in South Asia depend on its melt for drinking water and food production.
"This is very important knowledge, as this region and its glaciers feed the rivers which provide water to some of the most densely populated areas of the planet," said Holger Frey, a University of Zurich glaciologist who wasn't involved in the study.
The results of the paper could help scientists understand the sensitivity of glaciers to changes in climate, Dr. Frey and other researchers said. Researchers could build models that predict more accurately the fate of Himalayan and other glaciers, which would be helpful for projecting sea levels and deciding how to allocate water resources.
For the new study, researchers from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory calculated the rate of thinning for 650 glaciers along a roughly 1,250-mile stretch spanning India, Nepal, Bhutan and China during two time periods: 1975 to 2000; and 2000 to 2016.
The ice being studied was sometimes hard to get to, either because of difficult terrain or geopolitical issues. So, the researchers relied on satellite imagery and image-analyzing software. Modern satellites took the 21st century images with digital cameras. For the earlier period, the team used images taken by film cameras carried on U.S. satellites during the Cold War. The film was later digitized and declassified.
The researchers found that between 2000 and 2016, the region lost roughly 8 gigatons of ice each year, compared with roughly 4 gigatons in the earlier time interval.
The team's calculation of the one-degree Celsius warming that would have been necessary to melt that much ice matched historical records, which showed a similar jump in temperature.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to overturn Obama-era climate rules for power plants, vastly limiting the agency's ability to mandate tougher greenhouse-gas-emission rules that could force older coal- and gas-fired plants to close, according to a summary reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The move would be one of the most significant steps yet by the Trump administration to roll back climate policy, eliminating rules designed to force an industrywide decrease in emissions. Instead, the EPA plans to regulate the industry on a plant-by-plant basis, according to the summary, and will allow older plants to keep operating as they adopt improved, more-efficient technology.
An EPA official confirmed details of the plan late Tuesday but declined to comment further on the summary. The EPA has scheduled a "major policy announcement" with Administrator Andrew Wheeler on Wednesday that is widely expected to be the finalization of a plan in the works since President Trump's first months in office.
The summary closely parallels new policies the EPA proposed last August.
Environmental groups said then that proposal at best provides minimal legal cover for a 2007 Supreme Court decision requiring the agency to regulate carbon emissions as a pollutant. They will likely seek to reinstate the Obama administration policy, called the Clean Power Plan, which has been hung up at the Supreme Court in a case about whether it was illegally broad.
While the Clean Power Plan was designed to reduce greenhouse gases, Trump administration officials have cast their redo of regulation as a boon to coal plants, an attempt to reset rules they say unfairly set up coal-fired plants to fail and close. Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed to boost the fortunes of coal, oil and natural-gas producers.
By allowing older plants to make incremental improvements, the plan could keep coal-fired plants alive longer in a way that actually increases their greenhouse-gas emissions in aggregate, critics say. And over the long term, it reduces the pressure the Clean Power Plan would likely have eventually put on natural-gas-burning plants to be phased out for more zero-carbon power like wind and solar.
The details of the plan and how it shakes out could set a precedent for how much power any president has to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. And the changes come as the risks of climate change are becoming more pronounced and Mr. Trump's Democratic rivals are making climate central to their presidential campaigns.
The new plan limits the EPA in several ways, but most prominently by taking away the federal government's power to set emissions-reduction targets across the industry. Instead, the new rules allow the EPA to regulate only "inside the fence-line of" each plant, the summary says. It will create a menu of technological options the plants have to choose from to boost efficiency.

Full text: OTTAWA -- Canada said it would press ahead with the contentious expansion of a pipeline that carries crude oil to the Pacific Coast, after taking steps to address concerns from some indigenous and environmental groups.
The widely-expected decision ends nearly a year of uncertainty over the future of the Trans Mountain pipeline, formerly owned by Kinder Morgan Inc. and purchased last year by the Canadian government for 4.4 billion Canadian dollars ($3.3 billion). The lack of new pipeline infrastructure in Canada has weighed on the price of crude oil from Alberta, contributing to a yearslong slump for the energy sector.
The pipeline debate has also helped foment a bitter regional divide, pitting western Canada against the federal government in Ottawa, over resource development.
The Liberal government cabinet, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, originally approved the pipeline project in late 2016, but that decision was annulled last year by an appeals court.
The court said that the original government approval was flawed because western Canadian indigenous groups weren't properly consulted and that the initial regulator's findings didn't fully consider the impact of increased oil-tanker traffic on the environment.
That forced Mr. Trudeau and officials to restart the review process for the pipeline. Mr. Trudeau said that following a new review, the government has committed to additional steps for addressing worries over increased oil-tanker traffic. It has also done a more thorough job in consulting with aboriginals, and heeding their calls for measures to protect marine-life habitats.
Mr. Trudeau has made the fight against climate change a signature policy for this government. At a Tuesday press conference, the prime minister defended his decision as a responsible choice, arguing that income generated by the expanded pipeline would help Canada finance the economy's transition to clean energy.
"There's a lot more to be done [on the environment], for sure," he said. "But to bridge the gap between where we are and where we are going, we need money to pay for it."
Environmental groups condemned Mr. Trudeau's decision and promised to renew their fight. "Whether it has this approval or not, the path forward for Trans Mountain will not be an easy one," said Eugene Kung, a lawyer for West Coast Environmental Law, a Vancouver-based advocacy group.
Expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline envisages nearly tripling capacity on the existing 710-mile corridor to 890,000 barrels a day.

Full text: The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wants banks to get extra credit for making loans that help communities adapt to climate change and prepare for future natural disasters.
A paper released on Monday by researchers at the San Francisco Fed argues that banks should be able to receive credit for climate-adaptation investments under the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to lend to low- and moderate-income communities.
The report represents the latest in a series of small steps by Federal Reserve Banks to recognize climate change as a threat to the U.S. financial system.
"As we're seeing this increase in the severity of disasters, people at all levels are thinking about how can we reduce the cost in the future and how can we reduce the financial strain on communities in general?" said Elizabeth Mattiuzzi, a senior researcher in the community-development department at the San Francisco Fed, who co-wrote the paper.
The 1977 Community Reinvestment Act was passed to stop "redlining," a form of lending discrimination.
The Federal Reserve and other regulators examine banks every few years for compliance with this complex law.
These regulators are trying to revamp the rules in a way that would make the law more relevant today.
It is unclear if any potential changes involving climate change would be on the table, but the researchers said they fit with efforts to make the rules clearer.
Banks receive credit for investments that help areas recover immediately after federal-disaster declarations. The researchers argue that banks should also be able to receive credit for investments that help prepare communities for future disasters.
Funds, for example, could be used to retrofit homes to withstand extreme temperatures or flooding. Banks could receive credit for helping to fund developments for low- and moderate-income residents in areas where people are being forced to abandon the coastline.
Banks could also contribute in advance to a fund to provide emergency loans to small-business owners in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, so a program doesn't have to be created from scratch when something occurs.
Examiners who determine whether banks should receive credit for investments have discretion within broad federal guidelines and could look to the San Francisco findings.
"We're hoping this work will provide tools for banks and examiners to think differently about this issue," Ms. Mattiuzzi said.

Full text: New York state legislators on Monday reached a tentative deal on a landmark climate-change bill that would set up the state to have the highest standards in the country for greenhouse-gas emission reductions, lawmakers said.
The bill, called the Climate and Community Protection Act, would mandate that New York achieve an 85% reduction in emissions based on 1990 levels across all sectors of its economy. The state would need to meet this by 2050.
The bill would also require that 35% of state energy funds be invested into projects such as building renewable energy sources or weatherizing homes in communities that are most at risk of being affected by climate change. Investments related to the bill are expected to create 150,000 jobs a year in the first decade of its implementation, according to New York Renews, a coalition that has advocated for the bill.
If the bill passes, New York would be the only state with an 85% reduction target based on 1990 levels across all sectors of its economy, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In the past few weeks, New York lawmakers had been working on a more robust climate-change bill that would have mandated a 100% reduction in emissions statewide, and that would have directed 40% of state energy funds to at-risk communities, a mandate that concerned Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But lawmakers on Monday introduced new text for the bill that reflected some of the concerns of the state's business community.
Darren Suarez, the director of government affairs at the Business Council of New York State, an advocacy group, had previously called the original bill's zero-emissions goal "foolishness." Under the original bill, some companies, including plastics production, semiconductor production and steel mills, would be more likely to shut their doors or move states, potentially affecting 40,000 jobs, Mr. Suarez said.
Under the new bill, "there is a way to see continued operations of industrial facilities in the future, but it will be challenging," Mr. Suarez said.
Sen. Todd Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island and the bill's sponsor, said the concessions were necessary to ensure the ambitious emissions-reduction standards became law.
For the bill to pass before the legislative session ends Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo would likely need to waive a rule set by the state Constitution that requires three days to pass from the time a bill is introduced to when lawmakers can vote on it. A spokesman for the Democratic governor confirmed he would sign the bill.

Full text: Norway's sovereign-wealth fund is embracing renewable energy and winding down fossil-fuel investments.
The Scandinavian nation's Parliament voted on Wednesday to instruct its $1 trillion fund to pull an estimated more than $13 billion from oil, gas and coal extracting companies and move as much as $20 billion into renewable-energy projects and companies, representing around 2% of the fund.
The Government Pension Fund Global -- which has around 6% of its holdings in fossil-fuel equities -- won't pull investments from major oil companies but will divest itself from smaller energy exploration and production firms, according to a proposal from the Ministry of Finance. The move could affect several of its U.S. investments, including its 1.08% stake in Anadarko Petroleum Corp., 0.98% in Occidental Petroleum Corp. and 0.96% in EOG Resources Inc.
EOG declined to comment, while Andarko and Occidental didn't respond to requests.
Norway's sovereign-wealth fund is one of the largest in the world, investing in nearly 9,200 companies globally as of the end of 2018, according to government data. It has a stake in 341 oil-and-gas companies, the largest share in the U.S., at 31% of those holdings.
Norway forged its social-wealth fund in 1990 with profits from the North Sea oil fields. The country's divestment comes as government pension funds face mounting political pressure to exit from fossil fuels and realign their strategies around green businesses and clean energy to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.
"Unless oil companies dramatically increase their investment in renewables and change their business model, I expect the political pressure for more divestment will increase," said Kari Elisabeth Kaski, the finance committee lead of the Socialist Left party.
While political forces helped drive the divestment, the decision also reduces financial risk because the oil-and-gas industry is no longer as profitable since the oil-price drop in 2014 -- while renewables are in a growth phase, said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a research firm.
Anders Runevad, chief executive at Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems A/S, one of the world's largest listed wind-power companies, said the decision would help guarantee a solid return for future generations.
"We are at a tipping point in terms of where to invest to create long-term value, which is driven by the clear need to act on the global climate crisis and renewable energy increasingly outcompeting fossil fuel on cost," Mr. Runevad said.
Proponents of fossil fuels disagree with the reasoning behind shedding oil and gas, pointing to how coal, oil and natural gas will account for 77% of energy by 2040 globally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. "Clean natural gas and oil power our modern world -- and there has never been a better time to invest in it," said a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute.
Some divestment analysts argue that Norway's decision isn't significant since its fund will retain investments in oil-and-gas giants, including its 2.45% stake in Royal Dutch Shell PLC and 0.94% in Exxon Mobil Corp. as of the end of 2018. "Norway's empty gesture decision to divest its oil fund from select fossil fuel companies is hypocritical at worst and limited at best," said a spokesman for Divestment Facts, a project of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a trade association representing U.S. oil and gas producers.

Full text: A small but growing number of Republican lawmakers are urging action on climate change, driven by shifting sentiment among GOP voters and the effects of global warming, from stronger hurricanes to more destructive wildfires.
The group backs policies rooted in what they consider GOP principles, favoring market-based solutions rather than government regulations. Many are loyal supporters of President Trump, but they part with him on climate change, which he has dismissed as hyped.
In a memo circulated Wednesday to Republican congressional offices, the polling firm of longtime GOP strategist Frank Luntz warned that climate change was "a GOP vulnerability and a GOP opportunity." The firm conducted a survey for the Climate Leadership Council, a policy group promoting its variation of a carbon tax, and said in the memo that 69% of Republican voters fear the party is "hurting itself with younger voters" because of its climate stance.
Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida says the GOP needs to advance conservative proposals to combat climate change, or risk long-term political damage. "How can we as a party stand up to the generational challenges we face with globalization and automation and climate change if we don't look credible to the body politic?" Mr. Gaetz said in an interview.
In April, Mr. Gaetz announced his "Green Real Deal" plan that seeks to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by fostering innovation and entrepreneurship and reducing government regulations on the development of clean-energy technology. His plan is a counter to the "Green New Deal" proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and others that involves large federal investments in buildings, industries and transportation systems to slash emissions.
"The conversation is certainly shifting toward not just acknowledging the threats of climate change, but starting to talk about policies and solutions," said Ben Pendergrass, senior director of government affairs at Citizens' Climate Lobby, a nonpartisan advocacy group that helped create the bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus. The caucus, formed in 2016, has about two dozen Republican members.
Rep. Francis Rooney (R., Fla.), the new co-chairman of the caucus, joined Democrats in co-sponsoring a measure in January that would tax the carbon emissions of fuel producers and importers. Mr. Rooney also introduced a resolution in February that called for planning to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise.

Full text: For millennial investors, making a social impact is a top priority.
More than any previous generation, millennials are likely to invest in companies that mesh with their social and political concerns -- from clean energy to gender equality to water conservation. Some 77% of high-net-worth millennials currently own or are interested in so-called impact investments, according to a 2018 survey by Bank of America.
Now a wave of startups is rushing to capitalize on the trend by offering the mobile-first generation a host of new financial-tech products that cater to their social-investing preferences.
At the top of the offerings are smartphone applications that allow investors to choose portfolios that have themes representing different causes -- often very focused causes, such as companies with ethical practices in their supply chain or a higher share of women in leadership compared with their peers. In some cases, people can also tweak their portfolios easily, dropping an offending stock with just a tap of the screen. And all of the transactions can be done without calling in a broker or adviser, usually for fees that are lower than those pros charge.
Though many of the apps are still getting off the ground, they are seeing rapid growth, and are expected to grow even more as socially conscious, digital-savvy millennials accumulate wealth, adding an expected $11.6 trillion in assets in the U.S. alone over the next decade, according to the Deloitte Center for Financial Services.
"It's still an emerging discipline, and anything fintechs can do to help people better understand the impact of their investments is likely to be welcomed by the market," says Tony Gaughan, U.K. head of investment management at Deloitte.
The impact-investing apps are at the intersection of two major investing trends: the rise of investing apps and the growth in the sustainable-investing sector.
Last year, there were 12,903 Android and Apple apps globally that mentioned investing in their descriptions, up from 8,900 in 2015, according to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by Priori Data, a market intelligence firm.
Meanwhile, the sustainable-investing sector rose 34% to $30.7 trillion in assets in developed markets in 2018 from $22.9 trillion in 2016, according to the Global Sustainable Investing Alliance.
Impact-investing apps are picking up an increasing portion of that growth. Android and Apple investing apps that advertise some form of sustainable offering gathered around 24 million downloads in 2018, nearly doubling since 2015, according to Priori Data. And they punch far above their weight: Those 24 million downloads represent 5.9% of total investing-app downloads, even though those apps make up just 1.4% of the overall investing-app category.
Of course, apps aren't the first offering aimed at simplifying investing for socially conscious customers. Sustainable-investing products first appeared over a decade ago, such as mutual funds that screened out industries such as weapons, tobacco and fossil fuels. Since then, the industry has come up with a wider variety of sustainable funds and portfolios for investors. And now the apps are trying to take the idea further with much more focused offerings and a simplified investing process.
"The rise of more digitally nimble, low-cost platforms demonstrates an undeniable shift in the investment industry," says Ashley Longabaugh, wealth-management analyst at financial-services research firm Celent.
One question about the apps is performance. Most of the apps don't have a long record by which to judge them. But some investing experts point out that portfolios built around themes don't offer the same diversification as funds or strategies that track benchmarks like the S&P 500. So, themed investments may underperform the broader market if their sector cools off -- but they may also beat the market if their sector heats up.
Still, many sustainability investors say that they're willing to trade some returns for social impact. And some sustainability proponents argue that the conventional wisdom misses a crucial point: The business world is changing and moving toward sustainable industries and practices. So, those themes will be better bets down the road.
"Thematic investing isn't riskier. The reason people say that is because they have a hard time separating a fad from a structural shift in the economy," says Hardeep Walia, founder and chief executive of Motif, a thematic-investing platform founded in 2010 that today has more than 300,000 users. It offers around 180 portfolios aimed at specific trends, such as genomics and 5G technology. In 2017, it added an offering focused on the environment, labor rights and corporate governance. The environment is the most popular theme among millennial investors.
The apps typically offer one of two types of investments -- separately managed accounts or exchange-traded funds.
Separately managed accounts date to the 1970s, but have undergone something of a renaissance in the sustainable-investing community because of the personalization they offer over mutual funds.
As with funds, investors in separately managed accounts receive a bundle of stocks with tax advantages. But unlike with funds, investors can remove stocks they don't like, and the portfolio can automatically rebalance.
One app that embraces the separately managed account strategy is Swell, which is backed by life insurer Pacific Life. The company offers investors a separately managed account and they can select from seven portfolios -- from disease eradication to zero waste to a mashup of 400 companies across industries -- and they can remove up to three companies. Swell requires $50 to start an account and charges $75 for every $10,000 invested annually.
All of Swell's themed portfolios have notched gains since their inception in 2016, the company says, but only two beat the S&P 500 for all of 2018: healthy living and disease eradication. Swell's Impact 400 portfolio, a more diversified offering containing 400 companies aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, debuted in 2018 and ended above the S&P 500.
That performance doesn't faze some investors. Fiorella Juarez, a 36-year-old advertising professional who invests with Swell and Charles Schwab, says she is fine with the possibility that she might earn more with nonsustainable investments. She is in it for the long term.
"I feel like I can at least make a contribution with my money," says Mrs. Juarez.
Millennial investors "see firsthand that there is a collective group that actually wants to address these environmental issues," says Dave Fanger, founder and chief executive at Swell, which manages around $35 million from more than 15,000 clients, up from around $17 million from 4,000 clients a year ago. More than half of its investors are under the age of 34.
Launched in 2016, OpenInvest is another platform that uses separately managed accounts, building portfolios aimed around issues such as reducing carbon emissions, supporting ethical supply chains and fighting deforestation. As with Swell, if investors don't like a company in their portfolio, they can remove it.
"I basically got to build my own fund," says Alex Martin, a 30-year-old fintech professional who began using OpenInvest in 2016. He is notching gains above the S&P 500, he says, but he adds that he would stay with impact investing even if that changed.
"There's so many people that have views about the environment or have views about protecting society," he says, "but then they just put their money in the market and they don't realize they are investing against their values."
OpenInvest, which counts 60% of its users as millennials, requires a minimum of $100 to start an account and charges an annual fee of $50 for every $10,000 invested.
The apps that aren't built around separately managed accounts offer investors packages of ETFs with different sustainability themes. One critical difference: Investors can't remove stocks they don't like from an ETF as they can with separately managed accounts.
One investing app that heavily uses ETFs is Stash. Since launching in late 2015, the app has ballooned to more than three million users, with an average age of 29 and most of them new to investing: 86% of users identify as first-timers or beginners. The initial deposit to start an account is $5, and fees begin at $1 a month, plus the fees of individual ETFs. Stash declined to provide its assets under management.
The app isn't solely focused on impact investing, but six of around 59 themed ETFs to which it directs users are in the "missions and causes" category. As of January, 12% of the app's users were invested in social ETFs, doubling from 6% in 2016.
Meanwhile, old-line wealth-management companies, which helped introduce the concept of sustainable investments, have also come up with more-varied offerings to meet demand. They usually have substantially more assets than apps -- but also much higher fees and minimums to launch an account.
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, for instance, has formally offered an impact-investing service with themes such as climate change and gender diversity since 2012. It currently manages more than $27 billion of assets in sustainable solutions, with more than 120 investment strategies plus a suite of portfolios.
Investors need to contribute at least $5,000 to start a portfolio at the outset. Portfolios with investments under $10,000 are built through mutual funds, ETFs and single stocks, while larger accounts can receive separately managed accounts and alternatives. Morgan Stanley declined to disclose its fees.
"We find many clients are looking for an investment strategy that not only seeks to generate market-rate financial returns, but that also strives to deliver positive environmental and social impact," says Lily Trager, executive director and director of investing with impact for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

Full text: Abu Dhabi's $800 billion sovereign-wealth fund recently added a new question to its investment process: How will the Earth's changing climate affect a potential asset's price?
This addition, without fanfare or press release, was driven, fund officials say, by a fiduciary duty to earn the highest returns and avoid risks. It wasn't an attempt to brand the fund as more "green."
From huge sovereign-wealth funds and hedge funds to startup private-equity groups to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, asset managers and investors increasingly believe there are profits to be made and losses to be avoided by considering how climate change -- and government efforts to combat it -- might affect companies and industries over the long term.
Rather than a mere window-dressing exercise conducted for the benefit of conscientious investors, investing with the environment in mind is now seen as a way to gain an edge. Funds are pouring billions of dollars into technologies and industries they think will benefit from a transition to a clean-energy world and avoiding those that are likely to be hurt by it.
"Climate change is the growth story of our lifetime," says Martina Turner, who four years ago launched the $36 million Accessible Clean Energy Fund, which invests in a basket of around 30 stocks focused on energy efficiency and storage, as well as wind, solar and geothermal energy. "We're not ideologically driven, we're not philanthropists. We want to make money," says Ms. Turner, whose fund is up around 20% this year through April and has returned 22.5% since its inception.
The total value of funds that have integrated environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their investment process has more than quadrupled since 2014, rising to $485 billion as of April, according to data provider EPFR Global. That figure includes funds aimed at both individual and institutional investors, but it represents only part of the broader climate-change investing universe, as many funds that aren't labeled ESG also are investing with the climate in mind, analysts say.
Climate investing is essentially a bet on a major repricing in markets due to historic shifts in how we drive, heat our homes and regulate our industries. Areas that stand to prosper span a broad swath of industries from renewable energy to transport, and from green architecture to agriculture. Oil and coal companies, on the other hand, could lose out as investors fear the risk of "stranded" assets if electric cars pick up pace or governments crack down on fossil fuels. And some big investors are looking at which industries will be most affected by new rules and regulations.
Climate investing isn't without risk. Investing propositions often hinge on political will and global action, which can be hard to predict. After some governments started cutting subsidies for renewable energy earlier this decade, for example, shares of renewable-energy companies fell.
Still, funds big and small are jumping on the climate-investing bandwagon. BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, with more than $6 trillion under management, has launched an array of sustainable equity exchange-traded funds. It also is working with clients to build a portfolio focused on companies that are likely to be winners in a transition to a cleaner-energy future.
WHEB Asset Management, a London-based fund manager focused on sustainability, invests in themes such as water management, sustainable transport and cleaner energy. An early win included an investment in LED lighting. Now the fund is focusing on technology that digitizes manufacturing, aiming to improve energy efficiency. The fund avoids sectors such as oil, gas and coal that are likely to suffer or face severe disruption as a result of efforts to curb climate change.
"This isn't an ethical framing," says Seb Beloe, a partner at WHEB. "These industries are fundamentally at risk and looking at a future with capital destruction. We want to see cash and returns," he says.
Climate-related investing also is getting a boost from activist investors. Jana Partners LLC is best-known for heckling management over board composition and business structure. It made waves in 2017 by helping to prompt Amazon.com Inc.'s acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. Now Jana is looking to set up a fund to pressure companies on issues such as climate change, betting it can add value for shareholders by doing so.
Reima Rytsola, chief investment officer of Finnish pension fund Varma, is looking for climate opportunities inside traditional industries -- such as paint. Varma, which manages 45.4 billion euros ($51.1 billion), has invested in a big paint company that created a new type of coating that makes marine vessels more energy efficient. Mr. Rytsola bets that as the shipping industry faces intense government pressure to reduce its carbon footprint -- if it was a country, it would rank as the sixth-largest greenhouse-gas emitter world-wide -- demand for efficiency-enabling technologies will grow.
"We don't consider it a trade-off with returns," Mr. Rytsola says, adding that while such strategies sometimes take time to come to fruition, "in the long-run, this is the only way to generate returns."

Full text: When Marti and Tom Burbeck were designing their new four-bedroom home in Ann Arbor, Mich., they went to extreme measures, spending five years and what contractors estimate was $3.5 million to achieve as natural and healthy an environment as possible.
To make sure none of the materials they used contained toxic chemicals, they hired a consulting firm to check product contents, down to the glazing on tiles, with more than 900 manufacturers. And because the couple couldn't find shop-made cabinets and doors using wood from sustainably managed local forests, they had wood sent directly to the building site and hired a full-time carpenter to hand mill it all in their barn -- a process that took nearly a year. Rainwater is collected in cisterns for irrigation and a photovoltaic system supplies nearly 20% more electricity than is used over the course of a year.
"We're kind of pioneers," says Mr. Burbeck, 67 years old, who is part owner of an Ann Arbor-based publishing-software company. "We wanted to show it could be done."
The Burbecks' house is one of two private homes in the world -- the other is in Bend, Ore. -- that meet the International Living Future Institute's living-building challenge, implementing what it calls biophilic design as part of the requirements. The term comes from the concept of biophilia, coined in 1984 by Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson, who described it as "the urge to affiliate with other forms of life." The ultimate goal is to have a building's architecture achieve the same physical, psychological and emotional benefits as walking through a forest, says Amanda Sturgeon, CEO of the ILFI.
Until recently, the term biophilic design applied almost exclusively to hospitals, which aimed to promote wellness by increasing sunlight and views of trees and putting in gardens. Companies then began to adopt living walls, water features and skylights after studies showed proximity to nature could increase productivity and reduce stress. Hotels followed suit, with brands like Starwood using reclaimed materials, declaring it was "designed by nature." Now, following the trend of moving wellness into the home, more architects and designers are using biophilic elements in single-family residences.
It is more complicated than just using a lot of plants. One element incorporates shapes and forms found in nature, such as rounded walls and curved furniture. Architects create floor plans that lead from open spaces to sheltered areas, the way a person would feel walking through nature and finding clearings and places with shadows. There are circulation techniques, such as cutting slats in walls to make it feel like there are natural breezes. Colors, materials and patterns, such as botanical and animal motifs, are chosen for how well they mimic nature.
Anyone who has stayed in a hotel room where the windows didn't open, the carpet was synthetic and dressers were made of imitation wood can understand the appeal of biophilic design. Matt Aspiotis Morley, who owns a London-based design firm called Biofilico, describes it as "an ancestral response to modern problems." He retrofitted his own apartment in Barcelona for $22,000 by adding botanical wall decor (illustrations, artworks and photos of plants and landscapes), air filters with aromatherapy diffusers and nature sounds on his playlists, along with more than 30 house plants.
"It's not done for random effect. It's done for physiological and psychological reasons," says architect Helena van Vliet. She describes the biophilic principles she uses in the homes she designs as restorative. She says research supports that major health issues -- anxiety, violence, isolation and loneliness, as well as sleep disorders, fertility issues, elevated cortisol levels, allergies and asthma -- may be related to the design and structure of where and how people live.
Barbara Scott's first glimpse of her new house in Bend, Ore., was a curved line drawn on a piece of tracing paper by her architect, Al Tozer of Bend firm Tozer Design.
"It was very intriguing," says Ms. Scott, 60, a former teacher and spec-home builder. Mr. Tozer says that line became an indoor-outdoor wall and the "spine" of the house, mimicking the Deschutes River in front of the property. He used the biophilic elements of "prospect" and "refuge" -- the feeling of going from out in the open to cover -- when he designed the floor plan, delineating bright, open, airy spaces from more sheltered, contemplative rooms. Salmon-color exterior walls, inspired by the bark of a local shrub, and interior walls of reclaimed wood and natural clay plaster, chosen for their earthy hues and natural breathability, are intended to create a warm, fresh-smelling space.
The entire house is built to mimic a shade tree, with a long, narrow base under an expansive wood canopy of a roof. The overhangs are placed so the sun can get through the windows in the winter but not when it is higher in the summer, as if leaves are blocking it. Ms. Scott also chose to meet the Living Future Institute's living-building challenge, which meant eliminating toxic building materials such as PVC and necessitating the excavation of solid basalt -- at the cost of $1,200 a day for more than a month -- to place an underground rainwater cistern.
She almost halted the project several times due to the growing costs. With a total of three dwellings (a main house and two smaller homes) on site, the 4,810-square-foot project eventually took six years and cost about $3 million. "Psychologically, I am so much happier here. It has a calm and peacefulness," says Ms. Scott.
It is harder to create a sense of nature in the middle of a city, but that's what Gennaro Brooks-Church did after he bought a four-story brownstone in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn for $1.4 million in 2008. An artist and carpenter, he initially aimed to stop rainwater from leaving his property, building a pond ringed with rocks in his yard. Mr. Brooks-Church then spent about $700,000 enlarging windows and creating green walls on the interior and exterior. He put in a waterfall on his living roof and a two-story treehouse built from wood salvaged from an old water tower.
"I wanted to increase exposure to plants, sunshine and air in this place of artificial substances and concrete," says Mr. Brooks-Church, who also rents an apartment nearby, where he spent another $30,000 on biophilic designs. When neighbors asked him about his living wall, which has 1,400 plants and covers the entire facade of his house, he started a business called Eco Brooklyn and has since designed about 50 living walls throughout the city, including three in his own neighborhood. People started giving him turtles for his pond that they'd rescued from elsewhere (one came from a Chinese restaurant). There are now 12, along with fish, snakes and salamanders, creating a mini-ecosystem.
Kam Patel, a 49-year-old oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Chicago, had never heard the term biophilia, but he now credits it with reducing his stress. He says he hated going home to his previous house, which felt like living in a box. When he bought a 5,000-square-foot penthouse in the River North neighborhood, he hired a Chicago-based living-wall company called Sagegreenlife to custom design a wall in his living room, something that cost about $190 a square foot. Now he sits and looks at it every day. "I am much happier," he says.
In Ann Arbor, architect Michael Klement, of Architectural Resource, who designed Marti and Tom Burbecks' house, says he feels like the house represents as much a philosophy as it does a building. He says that although the project was expensive, many people spend as much on homes that aren't regenerative or connected to nature.
The Burbecks say they have designed their home to last at least 200 years, enduring climate change, new technology and evolving design trends. "We want this house to make a difference," says Mr. Burbeck.

Full text: Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell PLC can be both a cash cow and a company trying to meet the challenge of climate change.
That is Chief Executive Ben van Beurden's sales pitch as he meets with investors and analysts in London and New York this week.
Shell is slowly transforming into a cleaner business centered on selling electricity. But in the years to come, it aims to pay billions of dollars back to investors -- at least $125 billion in dividends and share buybacks between 2021 and 2025 alone -- all of it from traditional parts of the oil business.
All those payouts will come from returns on investments the company has already made, Mr. van Beurden said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Oil and gas production, retail gasoline, lubricants, trading and chemicals will be the company's biggest source of cash.
Mr. van Beurden is trying to lure investors back to the sector when, he said, investors are "really waking up" to the problem of climate change. Shell expects it will be decades before it can even halve the carbon emissions from its businesses and products. Any decline in the oil business is at least a decade away, Mr. van Beurden said.
And it will take just as long before investments in a cleaner electricity business produce a return.
"For decades and decades to come, the industry will have to invest in [oil and gas] in order to basically supply demand, which will be there," Mr. van Beurden said. "And as long as we feel we can have competitive positions, as long as we feel we can do that in an environmentally competitive way, a low-carbon way, etc., sure we will want to participate."
It is a challenging time in the oil business. As the effects from climate change grow, they have brought scrutiny from regulators around the world and some politicians in the U.S. aiming to cut carbon emissions or even more directly shrink the oil-and-gas industry.
Shell has been at the vanguard of large oil companies, especially European-based ones, that have vowed to change to cut emissions.
But that change often involves transforming the business entirely or relying on technologies yet to exist. Many investors have begun to wonder whether the oil industry might simply die, while environmentalists have criticized even the most progressive oil companies for failing to evolve fast enough.
Mr. van Beurden said some of that criticism is misleading. He defended Shell's investment in zero-carbon energy as wide-ranging.
The company has purchased a utility, an electric-car charging business and a stake in a solar-power company, he said. Still, those electricity businesses will take several years before they can become an equal part of Shell's portfolio along with oil, gas and chemicals.
"We better prove that first before we start putting billions and billions and billions of dollars in it.. . .It needs to be a gentle takeoff process," he said. "When we prove out that this business model that we have -- which is a business model of a future green utility -- actually works, yes, then we are going to step seriously on the accelerator."
Investors have shown little excitement for the pitch. Shell's shares are up about 1.5% this week, trailing broader market gains. They are also down about 20% over five years and largely flat for the past 18 months.
Investors have a dour view of oil more broadly, Mr. van Beurden said in a subsequent interview on Wednesday on CNBC.
Low oil prices troubled many companies in recent years, and now investors have near-term concerns about global economic growth along with long-term fears about crude demand.
That is why Shell keeps escalating the shareholder payouts from its traditional oil business, Mr. van Beurden said.
"The sector at this time is still a little bit in the doghouse," he said in the CNBC interview. "At some point in time fundamentals are going to reassert themselves and people are going to say 'Hey, if I get that type of yield on my investment, I better be part of the growth story that will bring.'"

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren released competing proposals to pump billions of dollars into the U.S. economy to fight climate change, seeking to connect with Democratic presidential primary voters animated by global warming.
The former vice president on Tuesday released a $1.7 trillion proposal for federal funding to address rising temperatures over the next decade, outlining steps to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It would leverage an additional $3.3 trillion in private investment and money from state and local governments in the next 10 years while including $400 billion to spur clean-energy research.
Mr. Biden's campaign called the Green New Deal, an effort led by congressional Democrats to fight global warming, a "crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face" but didn't explicitly endorse the full resolution.
"While we're standing around not doing much, the rest of the world is moving ahead," Mr. Biden said in Berlin, N.H., adding the U.S. should become "the innovative place in the world" to combat global warming.
Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has endorsed the Green New Deal plan in Congress, released plans to devote $2 trillion to help the U.S. dominate the clean-energy sector in a manner reminiscent of the space race during the 1960s.
"Like we have before, we should bank on American ingenuity and American workers to lead the global effort to face down this threat -- and create more than a million good jobs here at home," Ms. Warren wrote in a post on Medium ahead of a Tuesday campaign stop in Detroit.
Climate change has energized the early stages of the Democratic primary campaign, and the large field of 2020 contenders have sought to mark their territory on global warming and draw a contrast with President Trump.
Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax and championed the elimination of environmental regulations, calling them a threat to economic growth. In 2017, he pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, a move many Democrats have said they would reverse.
Republicans in Congress have assailed the Green New Deal, which includes calls for job guarantees and universal health care, as a socialist approach that would undermine the economy.
Mr. Biden's proposal doesn't advocate for a carbon tax or a "cap and trade" market system to curtail carbon emissions, which drive climate change. Instead, he said he plans to work with Congress to establish "an enforcement mechanism" by 2025, based on the principle that "polluters must bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting."
His plan envisions a push to make the nation's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, buildings and the electric grid, more sustainable while recommitting to the Paris climate treaty and pushing foreign governments to ramp up their climate policies.
He would propose paying for his plan by rolling back recent corporate-tax cuts, eliminating subsidies for the oil and gas industries and other steps.
Ms. Warren's green manufacturing plan would pump $1.5 trillion in government spending into clean-energy products like zero-emission vehicles and buildings for federal, state and local use.
She would devote $400 billion to a "Green Apollo Program" for clean-energy research and development, and commit another $100 billion to encourage foreign governments to buy U.S.-made technology.

Full text: As climate change makes coastal flooding a rising threat, stilt homes are an increasingly popular weapon against storm surges and routine flooding. Studies on climate change's impact on cities dating back a decade have called for incorporating stilt homes into housing plans.
In Miami, a city that is being forced to radically rethink housing amid the changing climate, architect Rene Gonzales works out of an office on stilts and has built many elevated homes. He believes their importance will only grow in coming years.
"It's truly our responsibility as architects to address this environmental issue and to build elevated homes in areas where we expect flooding and surges to be the case, so I see this as an opportunity," he says.
According to a 2018 study from the Union of Concerned Scientists and Zillow, Florida has more properties vulnerable to tidal flooding than any other state. In Miami Beach, there will be 12,095 high-risk homes in 2045 with a total value of $6,443,424,737.
Stilt homes have a foundation in Native American building practices, Gonzalez says. "In South Florida, we have the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes that build their homes off the ground for environmental reasons, to have breezes flow under the home, to bring the grain off the ground so that [it] would be away from rodents," he says.
He sees a similar phenomenon in nature. The mangrove tree has roots that grow above the ground. "These natural systems and these early homes are great examples of precedents that we should look at as we build the elevated homes."
Elevated homes aren't right for every property. After a number of stilt homes in California collapsed during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, causing several deaths, Los Angeles instituted new building regulations, including a requirement that the stilts be attached to street level foundations.
For those looking to build a home on stilts, Gonzalez recommends placing all of the home's systems, including electrical, air conditioning, water heater and filtration, and furnaces within the home at an elevation that is above expected storm surge or flooding levels.
While stilts are most common in homes located right on the coast, they also have benefits for properties in low-lying areas, while others can take advantage of scenic views.
One notable example is La Maison Tropicale, a prefabricated home created by designer Jean Prouve to provide housing for French colonial officers living in West Africa, where elevation helped with cooling. A 1951 prototype was auctioned off at Christie's in 2007 and bought by hotelier Andre Balazs for $4.97 million.
Famed California architect Richard Neutra created a row of stilt homes in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, including one that recently sold for $1.55 million, according to Zillow.
In Gonzalez's Miami work, he's seen clients respond to the views that stilt homes offer, as well as the appeal of an unusual design.
But for him, popularizing stilt houses is motivated by social responsibility: "It's a peace of mind that you have when a storm is going to hit."

Full text: SYDNEY -- Australian conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison's surprise come-from-behind win in national elections was fueled by a campaign that focused on fears that economic and climate policies pledged by center-left opponents would end the world's longest growth streak.
Mr. Morrison, who once carried a lump of coal into Parliament to illustrate the importance of commodity exports to the resource-rich economy, sealed victory in battleground states where many voters worried his Labor rivals would drive up living costs and threaten mining jobs with their environmental plans.
"I have always believed in miracles," Mr. Morrison said in a speech to jubilant supporters gathered at a Sydney hotel after Saturday's election.
He credited his victory to "quiet Australians" -- whose voices were largely not reflected in voter polls that for more than two years showed his Liberal-National coalition facing election defeat. Throughout his campaign, the 51-year-old Mr. Morrison focused on a simple argument: Conservatives are better managers of the economy.
In contrast, his Labor rival, Bill Shorten, 52, promised a bold interventionist approach to tackle growing wealth divides: ending tax breaks for investors and global corporations, while spending more on public health and education. The former union leader and lawyer stepped down after conceding defeat.
Climate change re-emerged as an election issue following a summer of wildfires, drought, floods and extreme temperatures. Voter support for policies aimed at addressing climate change was at the highest level since 2007. But, as in the U.S., divisions grew more stark as the issue gathered steam.
Labor pledged to reduce emissions by 45% from 2005 levels by 2030, after Australia under the conservatives became the first developed nation to abolish a price on carbon in 2014. The party also promised a push on renewable energy and electric vehicles, offering detailed and transparent policies that opened its agenda to months of concerted attack from Mr. Morrison.
Tom Wright, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the center-left party's failed approach could give U.S. Democrats pause in developing tactics ahead of elections next year. "Bold policies can hurt you. . .don't confuse the unpopularity of the government with the electorate moving to your ideology," he said on Twitter Sunday.
Australia's election was the latest in a series of polling misfires, including predictions of the U.S. presidential election outcome in 2016 and Britain's decision to leave the European Union. Few had seen Mr. Morrison's victory coming, including senior conservative officials.
Exit polls had pointed to a comfortable Labor victory.
The conservatives' fortunes were boosted in resource-rich states such as northeastern Queensland, where Mr. Morrison campaigned strongly in support of coal-mine projects located near the Great Barrier Reef, offsetting losses in more progressive cities along the east coast. His campaign also benefited from small populist parties whose message helped bolster the conservative vote.
Underscoring the city-versus-rural divide, one of the highest-profile casualties of the election was Tony Abbott, a former conservative prime minister and climate skeptic who in 2014 championed the dumping of carbon taxes. He was defeated in the Sydney beachside district he has held for 25 years by an independent candidate who made his resistance to climate change policies her key appeal.
With counting continuing Sunday, Mr. Morrison's Liberal-National coalition was hopeful of gaining a narrow majority in Parliament's 151-seat House of Representatives. If Mr. Morrison doesn't win enough seats to govern alone, he may yet need to strike a deal with independents to form a minority government, possibly forcing him to tackle climate issues to gain their support.
The election comes at a pivotal time for Australia, as global trade rivalries, falling home values, record debt and stagnant wage growth bite. The economy, which has been expanding for 27 years and counting, nearly stalled in the second half of 2018 as China's growth slowed. Annualized growth slipped to about 1% from 4% in the first half. The country's central bank is expected to begin cutting interest rates as soon as next month.
Mr. Morrison confronts a handful of pressing challenges. Chief among them: How to manage the country's ties with its biggest trade customer and most challenging foreign-policy relationship, China.
Relations have been strained since last year when Australia passed counterespionage and foreign-interference laws and the government locked phone giant Huawei Technologies Co. out of future 5G communication networks over national-security concerns.

Full text: MANCHESTER, N.H. -- At the start of his third presidential bid, Joe Biden likes to bring up his kinship with the man he calls "Barack."
Campaigning in New Hampshire, the former vice president invoked former President Barack Obama repeatedly, pointing to their partnership to curb global warming and pass the Affordable Care Act in an effort to draw a contrast with the person he hopes to challenge next year, President Trump.
"A man who was as straight as an arrow, and had great, great presence," Mr. Biden said of Mr. Obama on Monday, lavishing praise on his old boss during an event at a community college here. "The proudest thing about serving with him was there wasn't one single, solitary hint of scandal all eight years."
Mr. Biden is wrapping himself in the banner of the Obama years as a chief selling point to voters, appealing to Democrats yearning for a reset -- and an enhancement -- of Mr. Obama's policies.
Mr. Biden has built a sturdy lead in early polling, boosted by Democrats who value electability against Mr. Trump. In South Carolina, for example, a recent poll showed the former vice president with the support of nearly half of the primary electorate and an edge among black voters long loyal to Mr. Obama. But the primary will serve as a test of whether Mr. Biden's direct association with the 44th president will insulate him from critics in the party who view the former vice president's policies as too incremental and him as too willing to work with Republicans.
"From my point of view, they have to sink or swim on their own," said Patricia Dauvin, a retired consultant from Strafford, N.H., who attended Mr. Biden's event in Manchester. She said Mr. Biden was "No. 1 for me right now," but said she was also interested in California Sen. Kamala Harris, calling her a bright star.
In New Hampshire, the home of the nation's first presidential primary, Mr. Biden pushed back on a published report that he would pursue a middle ground to address climate change.
The Reuters report last week prompted Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to respond on Twitter that there is "no 'middle ground' when it comes to climate policy," signaling a future point of conflict.
Mr. Sanders told climate-change activists Monday night at Howard University in Washington, D.C., that without the U.S. acting "boldly and aggressively," the planet would be more susceptible to flooding, drought and extreme weather.
"The United States must lead the world with a global approach which emphasizes the Green New Deal," Mr. Sanders said, referencing the plan backed by liberals in Congress to address climate change. Mr. Biden hasn't signaled his support for the far-reaching proposal.
During the climate-change rally at Howard University, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) said she would "be damned if the same politicians who refused to act then are going to try to come back today and say we need a 'middle of the road' approach to save our lives."
Asked about her comments Tuesday, Mr. Biden said in Concord, "You never heard me say, 'middle of the road.' I've never been middle of the road on the environment."
Mr. Obama's legacy is expected to loom large during the campaign. Mr. Biden said he would lay out his climate agenda in an address later this month and he is expected to deliver a foreign-policy address in the coming weeks, a message grounded in his globe-traveling role as Mr. Obama's No. 2.
Mr. Obama has indicated that he has no intention of making an endorsement in the primaries soon, allowing the open process to play out. But Messrs. Obama and Biden speak regularly and Mr. Obama has made clear through his advisers that he considers his selection of Mr. Biden as his running mate to be one of his best decisions.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Every liberal legislative promise from a Democratic presidential candidate -- from Beto O'Rourke's $5 trillion climate-change plan to Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax to Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All idea -- comes with an asterisk: the U.S. Senate.
In a Democratic president's worst-case scenario, Republicans retain control of the Senate in 2020 and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) plays the grim reaper role he relishes, creating a graveyard for Democratic legislation.
But if Democrats regain the Senate, the fate of environmental, health and tax policy still will be constrained by a handful of more moderate Democrats. Even if Democrats change Senate rules to let any legislation pass with a bare majority, they would likely need to keep both wings of the party satisfied to muster at least 50 votes for their top priorities.
The dynamic is a reminder that the Democratic Party as a whole isn't necessarily on board with some of the more liberal proposals of the party's presidential contenders. And some of the candidates themselves -- particularly the early leader in Democratic primary polls, former Vice President Joe Biden -- have given little indication that they would push those ambitious progressive policies if they took office.
"Under the most optimistic scenario, I can guarantee there will be at least a handful of Senate Democrats who will be dead-set against doing what the advocates will be pushing for," said Jim Manley, an aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.).
This reality check looms over campaign-trail policy proposals that candidates make a central part of their stump speeches. A Democratic president trying to expand on President Obama's accomplishments or roll back President Trump's achievements will find those ideas shaped by the aims of a few senators.
One, for example, is West Virginia's Sen. Joe Manchin. He voted against Mr. Trump's tax law, wants improvements to the Affordable Care Act and wants to address climate change.
But he hasn't sponsored plans for a fully government-run health-care system. He has described his climate-change approach as pragmatic and advocates an energy policy that reflects the needs of his coal-producing state.
"I don't change at all. I'm still me," Mr. Manchin said as he described considering candidates' ideas. "I'm not changing for any of them."
Mr. Manchin -- along with Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, if he survives his re-election race next year -- could find themselves at the Senate's pivot point.
Democrats currently hold 47 seats in the Senate, and need a net gain of three for a majority if they have a vice president's tiebreaking vote.

U.N. Chief Sees Fading
Political Will to Fight
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the political will to fight climate change seems to be fading at the same time as things are getting worse for those feeling the effects.
Mr. Guterres made the comments in Auckland, where he spoke alongside New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Mr. Guterres plans to spend three days in New Zealand as part of a trip to the South Pacific to highlight climate change.
Mr. Guterres said countries weren't living up to their commitments under the 2016 Paris Agreement to keep the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
"We are not on track to achieve the objectives defined in the Paris Agreement," Mr. Guterres said. "And the paradox is that as things are getting worse on the ground, political will seems to be fading."

POLAND
Nationalists Protest
Restitution for Jews
Thousands of nationalists marched to the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, protesting that the U.S. is pressing Poland to compensate Jews whose families lost property during the Holocaust.
The protest took place on Saturday amid a rise in anti-Semitic hate speech. It appeared to be one of the largest recent anti-Jewish demonstrations. It also comes as far-right groups are gaining in popularity, pushing the conservative government further to the right.
Protesters, including far-right groups and their supporters, say the U.S. has no right to interfere in Polish affairs and that Washington is putting "Jewish interests" over Poland's.
Poland was a major victim of Nazi Germany during World War II and those protesting say it is not fair to ask Poland to compensate Jewish victims when Poland has never received adequate compensation from Germany.

VATICAN
Pope Gives Church
19 New Priests
Pope Francis has given the church 19 new priests, ordaining the men in a ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica, as the credibility of the Vatican and many of its clergy is threatened by scandals of pedophile priests and systematic efforts at cover-ups.
Fifteen of the seminarians ordained by Francis are Italian; the others are from Croatia, Peru, Haiti and Japan. The seminarians' ages range from mid-20s to 46.
During his homily, Pope Francis instructed them to never "tire of being merciful" toward the faithful who confess sins.
The pope made no mention of the scandals or of his recent efforts to encourage accountability by bishops and others in church authority.
Last week, the pope issued a church law that requires all priests and nuns to report sexual abuse by clergy as well as cover-ups by their superiors to church authorities.

Full text: Discussions about the future of the Arctic stumbled over U.S. opposition to collective goals on climate change, U.S. officials and participants at a gathering of top diplomats in Finland said.
The eight-country Arctic Council failed to approve a signed, joint declaration, leading several participants to back a statement issued separately by the Council's chairman, Finnish Foreign Minister Timo Soino, who wrote that "a majority of us" consider climate change an urgent challenge.
The Council is a group of countries with Arctic territory -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the U.S. -- and includes local groups and observer nations with interests in the region.
The breakdown in discussions at Tuesday's meeting reflects the Trump administration's diplomatic preferences. The administration plays down multilateral agreements, especially those that don't bind other countries by law, and instead seeks to maximize benefits for the U.S. on the international stage.
"Collective goals, even when well intentioned, are not always the answer," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a Council session.
The secretary cited the administration's preference for multilateral organizations it believes respect national sovereignty. In 2017, the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris climate accord, citing similar reasons.
Some U.S. lawmakers criticized Mr. Pompeo's approach to the Arctic Council meeting.
"It's almost silly not to talk about climate change," said Sen. Angus King (I., Maine) in an interview. Mr. King is recognized as a lawmaker who has focused on Arctic issues for years. "To ignore what brought the current reality into being is not very helpful."
Despite his disagreement with Mr. Pompeo's approach, Mr. King said it is a positive sign that the administration is giving greater attention to the region.
Mr. Pompeo at the Arctic Council meeting also worked to mend relations with Canada over statements he made about American claims in the region.
"The U.S. has a long-contested feud with Canada over sovereign claims through the Northwest Passage," the waterway connecting the Pacific and Arctic oceans, Mr. Pompeo said Monday. Winding through Canada's northernmost territories, the passage is claimed by Canada as its own, but the U.S. has said it is an international strait.
The U.S. plans to increase its Arctic presence, Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said last week, including plans to send ships through the Northwest Passage on a freedom-of-navigation operation, intended to assert international access rights.
After Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland restated her government's position on Tuesday that the Northwest Passage is Canadian, Mr. Pompeo didn't challenge the assertion.
The breakdown in talks over a joint declaration occurred when the U.S. didn't agree to a provision about the need to reduce emissions of black carbon, the product of diesel engines and wood burning.
Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. has nonetheless recently logged the largest reduction in black carbon emissions by any Arctic Council state.
Rather than issue a declaration, the foreign ministers meeting in Finland issued a short "joint statement" that didn't mention climate change, instead stressing the importance of the work of the Arctic Council in maintaining peace in the region.

Full text: DEBT COLLECTION
CFPB Updates Rules
For Digital Devices
Consumers with debts in collection could soon see email and text messages replace phone calls and letters as the main channels of communication from debt collectors.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday unveiled a plan to update rules governing debt-collection practices, proposing to reduce the number of calls collectors can make to consumers and clarifying how debt collectors can use modern technologies, such as voice mail, email and text messages, to communicate with consumers. The proposed rule is expected to spur a shift in how the debt-collection industry operates.
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was written in 1977 long before today's digital communications tools became widely available. It doesn't specifically allow or prohibit such communications tools, creating uncertainty that has left collectors to rely largely on phone calls to contact consumers.
The proposed rule would prohibit debt collectors from making more than seven attempts to collect a specific debt by telephone a week. The limit doesn't apply to email or text messages.
Consumer groups said the proposal would allow the harassment of consumers.
"Seven calls per debt, per week is simply too many," said Margot Saunders, a lawyer for the National Consumer Law Center.

ECONOMY
Job Openings Again
Exceed Unemployed
A bounce-back in employment opportunities in March kept job openings well ahead of the number of Americans seeking work for the 13th straight month, a challenge for employers looking to fill open roles.
There were 7.49 million unfilled jobs on the last business day of March, up by 346,000 from February, the Labor Department said Tuesday.
Openings increased in transportation, construction and real estate.
Jobs remain plentiful compared with the number of Americans who are unemployed, with 1.28 million more available jobs than unemployed people.
The rate at which workers quit their jobs held steady at 2.3% in March for the 10th straight month.

NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
Phone-Surveillance
Status Is Sought
A group of Democratic senators asked the National Security Agency to clarify publicly the status of a surveillance program that collects information about U.S. phone calls and text messages, saying an update is needed so lawmakers can decide whether to renew the controversial spying tool.
Six Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee sent a letter to Gen. Paul Nakasone, director of the NSA, requesting a "public status report" to address confusion over how -- or whether -- the Trump administration is using the so-called call-detail record program, which will lapse in December unless Congress passes legislation to renew it.
The program has been beset by uncertainty in recent months amid mounting questions about its operational value and whether it complies with the law. The spy agency last summer said it was purging its database of call-detail records after learning it was receiving information it wasn't authorized to obtain, including data about phone numbers not connected to any surveillance target.
The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the NSA had recommended that the White House abandon the program, saying that the logistical and legal burdens of keeping it outweigh its intelligence benefits.
The call-records program began in secret in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

FEDERAL RESERVE
Bank Prepares for
Climate Shocks
The Federal Reserve stands ready to respond to climate-change related weather disruptions to the economy and is working to ensure banks' resilience from unexpected shocks tied to a warming global environment, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress in an April letter.
"Although addressing climate change is a responsibility that Congress has entrusted to other agencies, the Federal Reserve does use its authorities and tools to prepare financial institutions for severe weather events," Mr. Powell wrote in a letter to Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii), on April 18.
Some at the Fed believe climate change isn't something that matters much for monetary policy.

Full text: PRESIDENTIAL RACE
Sen. Bennet Makes
White House Bid
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet entered the 2020 presidential primaries, bringing a moderate voice from a Western state into the crowded Democratic field.
Mr. Bennet made his announcement in an interview Thursday on "CBS This Morning," becoming the 21st major Democrat seeking to challenge President Trump next year.
The senator, who has carved out a reputation as a workhorse over a decade in the Senate, is the latest centrist Democrat to join the field, following last month's arrival of former Vice President Joe Biden.
In a video outlining his candidacy, Mr. Bennet described himself as "an idealist, a pragmatic idealist. You can't fix a broken Washington if you don't level with the American people."
Mr. Bennet joins former Gov. John Hickenlooper as the second presidential candidate from Colorado.

CLIMATE
House Passes Bill
On Paris Accord
House Democrats passed legislation aimed at preventing President Trump from exiting the Paris climate agreement.
The bill would require the Trump administration to submit an annual plan to Congress for meeting the U.S. commitment to the Paris Agreement, which the U.S. joined under President Obama and which seeks to limit average global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius. Mr. Trump has moved to leave the pact by November 2020, saying it unfairly punishes the U.S. economy.
The largely symbolic Democratic proposal includes no plan to meet the agreement's targets for reducing carbon emissions, and the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to consider the legislation. Democrats say it is an opportunity for the party to stake out an initial position on climate change as it grapples with more wide-ranging alternatives like the Green New Deal.

ECONOMY
Initial Jobless Claims
Unchanged for Week
The number of Americans filing applications for new unemployment benefits was unchanged last week, after rising sharply in mid-April.
Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., was a seasonally adjusted 230,000 in the week ended April 27, matching the previously published level, the Labor Department said Thursday.
The mid-April claims rise was unexpected partly because unemployment benefit applications had been hovering near 200,000. Analysts said seasonal adjustment issues around Easter and other holidays may explain the rise.
Still, the claims figure remains near historic lows, signaling the labor market remains strong heading into the summer months. Job openings have outnumbered unemployed workers recently, making it harder for managers to find and keep employees.

NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER
California Rabbi
Meets With Trump
President Trump celebrated the National Day of Prayer with victims of last weekend's California synagogue shooting.
Mr. Trump and Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein of the Chabad of Poway synagogue spoke by phone after the shooting. The rabbi said Thursday in the White House Rose Garden that Mr. Trump was the first person "who began my healing."

Full text: A month before his inauguration, and shortly after he had finished a round of golf with Tiger Woods, Donald Trump was introduced to an adviser of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the chief advocacy group for American corporations.
Stanton Anderson stood in the clubhouse of Mr. Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla., and extended his hand to the president-elect.
Mr. Trump refused it.
"You guys did everything to stop me," Mr. Trump said, his face reddening, according to two people who were there. "I haven't forgotten."
In the two years since, relations between Mr. Trump and Washington's biggest lobbying organization haven't much improved.
The chill has hurt the U.S. Chamber, which for decades was the unmatched voice of industry. Its revenue has dipped, spending on lobbying and elections has fallen, and its large-donor pool has shrunk.
After eight years tussling with the Obama administration, the chamber hoped a business-friendly administration would help reanimate its power. But Mr. Trump's populism has refashioned the GOP agenda, and that has cut against priorities of various chamber constituencies that oppose tariffs and view immigration as a useful labor supply.
"I feel they are not much of a force anymore," said U.S. Rep. Justin Amash (R., Mich.), a conservative Republican who has been at odds with the chamber. "I believe in free markets and am against cronyism and corporate welfare, and they support those things."
The chamber said in a statement: "Today, we are stronger than ever with the influence, expertise, partnerships, and long-term vision to drive our members' agenda in every political environment and well into the future."
The group has found little refuge across the aisle. "The chamber dug themselves into a deep, deep hole when they decided to become an arm of the Republican Party and even oppose moderate Democrats," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate.
Not long ago, corporations seeking a voice in elections and public-policy decisions had few options beyond the chamber. It represents about 80% of the Fortune 100 companies and commands a platoon of lobbyists. Since 1998, it has spent $1.5 billion on lobbying, more than any other interest group and three times the amount spent by the next-largest.
The group now competes with dozens of super PACs and scores of advocacy coalitions -- nimble lobbying operations that serve companies on specific legislative issues and then fade away.
The chamber has drawn much of its money from older industries such as tobacco, oil and gas, transportation, defense and manufacturing. On their behalf, the chamber has battled environmental regulations, restrictions on cigarette packaging, workplace antidiscrimination rules and minimum-wage requirements.
Some of those fights have been opposed by other members, such as CVS Health Corp. and Apple Inc., both of which quit the chamber in recent years. That makes it hard to build a unified position that pleases everyone.
"If you are the big dog, how do you work to remain the big dog with so many little dogs chipping at your heels?" said David Rehr, a business lobbyist for 25 years and former president of the National Association of Broadcasters.
Chamber Chief Executive Officer Thomas Donohue, a pugnacious 80-year-old Irish Catholic from Brooklyn, isn't a fan of Mr. Trump, according to people close to the chamber chief. Early in the 2016 primary season, Mr. Donohue, a vocal advocate of free enterprise, said on Bloomberg Television that Mr. Trump had "very little idea about what trade really is."
After Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination, the chamber ratcheted up criticism of his "America First" trade policies, warning that millions of jobs would be lost. The next day, at a campaign rally in Bangor, Maine, Mr. Trump said the chamber was "controlled totally by various groups of people that don't care about you whatsoever."
The chamber said Mr. Donohue, who wasn't made available for an interview, has since praised the president on many issues.
Weeks after Mr. Trump snubbed Mr. Anderson at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida, he was sworn in as president and invited a chamber executive to the White House to meet with advocacy groups about the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch.
At the meeting, the president derided the executive as the "chamber guy," according to people familiar with the exchange. The chamber "wasn't very nice to me," Mr. Trump said, and he grumbled about criticism of his trade policy.
The chamber official responded that Mr. Trump and U.S. companies have plenty to agree on. The president said, "Tell your boss" that the two men, Messrs. Donohue and Trump, should move on.
Months later, Mr. Donohue was named to the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, an advisory board run by the Labor Department.
"President Trump and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce share a vision of ensuring policies are in place that support a growing economy and the American worker," the White House said in a statement.
At a board meeting in Aventura, Fla., this March, executives complained about the absence of prominent Trump administration figures.
The same month, the Business Roundtable, a rival lobbying group, hosted Mr. Trump, Ivanka Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and National Economic Council Director Lawrence Kudlow at their quarterly meeting in Washington.
The chamber's featured guest, meanwhile, was former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The following day, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, spoke to a separate gathering of chamber officials.
Challenges to the chamber come at a crucial time for business, which is pressing for decisions on China trade, tariffs and infrastructure spending. The chamber has little influence over Democratic policy proposals that many of its members oppose: the Green New Deal environmental plan and health-care legislation that could substitute government-run insurance for private health plans.
Some of the harshest blows have come from former allies.
"When I got to Washington, I naively thought that the Chamber of Commerce was about lower tariffs and regulations and creating a better business environment for everybody," said Jim DeMint, the former Republican senator from South Carolina. The chamber had bought ads for him during his 2004 GOP primary.
"I now pronounce them totally part of the swamp," Mr. DeMint said.
Over the years, Mr. Donohue built up the chamber's financial muscle, traveling around the U.S. to drum up contributions and give speeches. A sign on his desk reads, "Show me the money."
By 2014, the chamber reported more than $275 million in annual revenue from membership dues and contributions, up from about $70 million when Mr. Donohue took charge in 1997, according to public tax filings.
One strategy has been to solicit donations from companies for specific goals. Since donor names aren't public, the chamber could pursue controversial fights without identifying firms that would benefit.
"I want to give them all the deniability they need," Mr. Donohue told Washington Monthly magazine in 2010.
During his tenure, the chamber successfully pushed for lower taxes, fewer regulations, greater free trade and curbs on labor unions.
In recent years, financial support from big donors has shrunk. The number of companies contributing $1 million or more to the chamber fell to 23 in 2017 from 42 in 2012, tax records show.
Dow Chemical Co., for instance, cut its chamber contributions to roughly $1.1 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million three years earlier, according to company figures. The company didn't respond to requests for comment.
Altogether, the chamber and its affiliates received roughly $220 million from corporations and other business groups in 2017 compared with $277 million in 2014, according to tax filings. The chamber said contributions rose last year.
Mr. Donohue has delegated many responsibilities of the chamber's operations to Suzanne Clark, the senior executive vice president.
Ms. Clark, with the approval of Mr. Donohue and the board, has been reshaping the century-old organization, including a campaign to recruit more small and midsize firms, especially in high-tech industries and renewable energy. The chamber has also shifted some policy positions that better align with the changing views of its membership.
When President Obama took office, the chamber opposed the leading climate-change bills advanced by Democrats.
The chamber has acknowledged, however, that industry plays a role in rising temperatures. It has also proposed short-term policy changes to address climate change, such as increased federal research funding on clean energy. It still opposes broad regulations.
For years, the chamber urged lawmakers to vote against legislation that would prohibit some forms of discrimination by companies on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2014, it adopted a neutral stand. Last month, it endorsed the bill.
The chamber also revamped its congressional-vote scorecard this year, which is expected to boost the scores of some Democratic lawmakers.
Changes under Ms. Clark have created rifts among some chamber employees, according to current and former employees. The chamber's media-relations team resigned this year over complaints about management, according to people familiar with the matter.
Even with the decline in contributions, the chamber last year spent $95 million on lobbying, more than any other group. In 2014, it spent $124 million, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Unlike its smaller competitors, the chamber has significant overhead. Mr. Donohue has said it takes about $1 million each workday to cover its 500 employees, fund advocacy work and keep the lights on at the building it owns across from the White House.
In 2017, the chamber spent $86 million on salaries and benefits, which accounted for more than half of its revenue that year. By comparison, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry trade association known as PhRMA, spent $70 million in salaries in 2017, equal to about 15% of its annual revenue, according to tax filings.
Mr. Donohue earned $6.6 million in 2017, making him the highest-paid head of any Washington trade group. His perquisites cost more, according to people familiar with chamber finances.
In Washington, Mr. Donohue travels in a chauffeured SUV accompanied by two security guards. On weekends, he uses the chamber's private jet service to reach his Florida vacation home, often with a guest, according to his calendar. On overseas trips, his physician sometimes joins him.
Personal or guest trips are either reimbursed or claimed as income, the chamber said.
Mr. Donohue has avoided talk of retirement, though senior chamber officials and members of the board have pressed him about it.
Several times over the past year, chamber officials approached former House Speaker Paul Ryan about the job. He declined, his spokesman said.

Full text: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- Joe Biden is getting a preview of what it might take to persuade liberals in his own Democratic Party that he is the right person to defeat President Trump.
Traveling through Iowa this week for the first time since launching his 2020 campaign, the former vice president has dug into President Trump's stewardship of the nation at every stop and pointed to his own partnership with President Obama. Yet he continues to find himself on the receiving end of critiques from the left for his voting record (too moderate) and fundraising prowess (too dependent on big donors).
"This is the burden of being a front-runner, especially so early on and with such a large field," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief public affairs officer with the liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org. "Your record is going to be picked at."
During a Biden event at a Des Moines brewery Wednesday evening, a half-dozen demonstrators wore penguin masks near the stage as the former vice president spoke. They held signs that read, "Climate is a Crisis."
Mr. Biden told them he would address climate change, saying, "By the way, I got there before any of the other candidates did." He later noted that he had authored a Senate bill to address climate change in the mid-1980s. "You're preaching to the choir," he said.
Hours after Mr. Biden kicked off his campaign last week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders rattled off a series of votes in Congress -- on everything from trade to the war in Iraq -- in which they reached different conclusions. "When people look at my record versus Vice President Biden's record, I helped lead the fight against Nafta. He voted for Nafta," Mr. Sanders said in an interview with CNN'S "AC360."
Mr. Biden, asked about Mr. Sanders's criticism in Monticello, Iowa, on Tuesday, declined to enter the fray. "I'm not going to get in a debate with my colleagues here," he told reporters, adding that he was proud of his record.
Mr. Biden is likely to face incoming criticism from more than a single candidate in a field that could reach two dozen. Still, he leads early polling, helped by goodwill in the party and his ties to Mr. Obama.
He has made Mr. Trump the focal point of his attention, casting the election as a national emergency and aiming to turn the race into a one-on-one matchup with the president. Mr. Trump has responded with a series of tweets criticizing Mr. Biden's endorsement from a national firefighters union, suggesting that the union's leaders are Biden allies but its members prefer Mr. Trump.
For Mr. Biden, the implication is that the party needs to focus on winning as opposed to adhering to a series of litmus tests -- a message that resonates with his supporters.
"Bernie is promising the moon," said Shirley Healy, a 76-year-old retired nurse who saw Mr. Biden during an event in Dubuque. "We need to get back what Trump took away."
In his first few days of campaigning, Mr. Biden has sketched out parts of his policy agenda, promising to restore the "dignity of work," set a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, provide a public option through Medicare to expand the reach of the Affordable Care Act, and reverse the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and large corporations from Mr. Trump's tax overhaul.
Mr. Biden has stopped short of endorsing a single-payer, Medicare-for-All health system espoused by Mr. Sanders and several candidates, a wealth tax proposed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or a Green New Deal-style plan pushed by liberal members of Congress.
That could be a liability in Iowa, where a March poll by the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom found that more than half of likely Democratic caucus-goers would be satisfied with the nation becoming more socialist.
"Bernie shook it up in a big way four years ago. . .and now most of the candidates are playing off that agenda," said Ed Fallon, a former Democratic legislator and climate-change activist in Iowa.
Mr. Biden's Democratic rivals, meanwhile, are trying to raise millions online from small donors and have sworn off money from lobbyists. They have zeroed in on his $6.3 million fundraising haul in the first 24 hours of his campaign.
But defeating Mr. Trump remains the top concern for many Democrats, who said they are willing to look past specific issues. "I'm more liberal than him, but this is a good, realistic option," said Hannah Riley, 23, a nursing student who attended Mr. Biden's event in Cedar Rapids.

Full text: The complex relationship between Antarctica's glaciers and the land on which they rest may help slow the rate of ice loss in the long term, according to a new method for modeling such interactions.
Scientists are confident that as the Earth warms, more of its ice sheets will melt, adding to rising sea levels. But how much and how quickly they will shed their water are big unknowns. The new study is part of world-wide efforts to decrease those uncertainties by gathering more detailed data and developing new analytical methods that can more closely simulate the processes affecting the stability of the ice sheets.
"We need to learn more about the processes that elevate sea level, and this study is a very important step in this direction," said Anders Levermann, a climate scientist in Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who wasn't involved in the research. "This study tells us there's another process that we have to monitor."
The new model takes into account, at a higher resolution than previous ones, the way land springs up after ice is removed, according to glaciologists. (Models break up geographical areas into grids, like pixels in a photo. The smaller the area those grids represent, the more detail a model has.) The land rebound helps stabilize glaciers by propping them up at the point where the frozen rivers start to float. The ground's hold increases friction, which steadies them.
The phenomenon has been documented in other parts of the world, including North America.
The effect is greatest after a lot of a glacier's mass has been lost, according to the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Science. The phenomenon is similar to a mattress that rises after someone gets out of bed, said Eric Larour, an ice-sheet modeler at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and one of the authors of the study.
The team focused on West Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier, which scientists believe is especially vulnerable to climate change.
Within the next 100 years, the rebound of land beneath Thwaites could slow down the glacier's retreat by about 1%, according to the study. But by 2350, that effect could hover around 40%, as more mass is lost and the earth has more opportunity to rebound.
While those rates of retreat are slightly lower than those previously projected, glaciologists offered caution. The new results don't change the outlook for the ultimate collapse of Antarctica's ice sheets, or for current projections of resulting sea-level rise in a warming world.

Moving Ice Sheets
Are Tricky to Track
A glacier's stability hinges on many variables, including its interactions with ocean waters, the sea floor, wind, and even the microbial world around them.
Some factors, like the land-rebounding effect or friction a glacier encounters along the sides of mountains as it travels toward the sea, can be stabilizing. Others, like warming waters, can have the opposite effect.
Modeling these dynamics -- and their interplay -- is difficult technologically, requiring sophisticated software development, nuanced data, large amounts of computing power and time, according to modeling experts. It took 24 hours and a supercomputer to run the new model, plus roughly six years to develop it, according to the researchers.
In part because of these constraints, models can't incorporate all the variables that affect ice sheets.
The new model doesn't include some destabilizing factors, such as westerly winds that can push warm water toward glaciers, according to glaciologists.

Full text: MIAMI -- The Little Haiti neighborhood has never held much appeal to real-estate developers. Its inland location is flanked by railroad tracks and an interstate highway. It has long been home to working-class Haitian and other immigrants and mom-and-pop shops that cater to them.
Now, due in part to the area's higher elevation in a city vulnerable to rising sea levels, more property firms are flocking to Little Haiti. Investors are scooping up homes and industrial lots. Others are building office towers, trendy restaurants and hotels.
The new development has helped boost home prices in much of Little Haiti by 7% over the past year, nearly double the rate of Miami overall, according to CoreLogic Inc.
But longtime residents are worried they could become displaced as part of a gentrification wave that has already forced some out.
"Every day, we are seeing the impact," said Marleine Bastien, executive director of Family Action Network Movement, an advocacy group in the neighborhood.
Residents in other low-income, higher-elevation Miami neighborhoods, such as Liberty City, Overtown and Allapattah, are worried that new development could make their neighborhoods more expensive too. They also lie on a ridge that stretches from northern Miami-Dade County to the Florida Keys. Little Haiti sits at roughly double the elevation of affluent coastal areas like Miami Beach, which on average is 4 feet above sea level.
"With climate change a factor, that's a multiplier to market forces already at play," said Samuel Diller, executive director of the Haitian American Community Development Corp., which has teamed up with other organizations to create more affordable housing in the area.
The migration shows how rising sea levels are beginning to play a role in redrawing the residential map in South Florida, as some of those with means retreat from the seaside to the perceived safety of higher ground.
In November, Miami commissioners passed a resolution directing the city manager to research "gentrification that is accelerated by climate change" and to examine ways to stabilize property tax rates to allow people in affected areas to continue living there.
"As people move inland, we want to make sure there aren't waves of displacement," said Gretchen Beesing, chief executive of Catalyst Miami, which focuses on poverty and climate issues.
Jesse Keenan, a Harvard University professor cited in the resolution, released research last year showing that housing prices in Miami are beginning to increase more slowly near sea level than at higher elevations.
Eugenie Noel, a Little Haiti resident for nearly three decades, lives with her four sons, aged 18 to 26 years old, in a two-bedroom apartment where they pay $850 a month in rent. She said the landlord has warned he may raise it.
"The neighborhood is changing," said Ms. Noel, a 58-year-old housekeeper. "It is becoming very expensive for people like me to afford it."
On one street, strip malls that once housed restaurants, a tax-service business and tuxedo shop are being remade as sleek storefronts. Nearby, The Citadel, a complex featuring an upscale food hall and cocktail bar, recently opened.
Farther south, developers of the planned Eastside Ridge project are seeking city approval to replace an apartment complex with a large mixed-use development that has some 3,000 rental units, office space and a hotel.
Up the street, another team is proposing the Magic City Innovation District, which would convert 18 acres of industrial or vacant property into a campus with residential, office and retail components as well as cultural offerings.
The developers have said in presentation materials regarding the city's resiliency strategy that the site would be "an anchor for sustainable development given its location on a ridge providing resiliency to sea-level rise."
Representatives for both projects say developers aim to preserve Little Haiti's cultural heritage and together will contribute tens of millions of dollars to a fund designed to provide more affordable housing.
Local organizations are also pursuing an initiative to create more housing options. Nonprofit entities known as community land trusts, used for years in cities like New York and Cleveland, buy up land to build housing that is leased to low-income residents at below-market rates.
One such partnership among the Haitian American Community Development Corp., the South Florida Community Land Trust and Citi Community Development, which is affiliated with Citigroup Inc., is building a 13-townhouse project in the heart of Little Haiti.
Ms. Noel hopes to qualify for a three-bedroom unit. "My children love Little Haiti," she said. "They want to stay."

Climate Protests
Disrupt London
Climate-change protesters disrupted central London for a fourth straight day, continuing demonstrations that have seen activists inundate several of the capital's landmarks and more than 400 people arrested.
Extinction Rebellion, a group promoting civil disobedience to raise awareness about climate change, describes itself as an international movement that uses peaceful protest to "minimize the risk of human extinction and ecological collapse." The group's activists volunteer to be arrested and orchestrate stunts that attract media attention to climate change.
So far, these have included pouring gallons of fake blood outside the gate of 10 Downing Street, the British prime minister's official residence, camping on Waterloo Bridge, and getting activists to chain themselves to a fence outside the home of opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
A survey of 3,561 British adults found 52% either "somewhat oppose" or "strongly oppose" the action. That compares with 36% who "strongly support" or "somewhat support" it.
Extinction Rebellion has three demands: that the British government declare a climate-change emergency, that it reduce greenhouse emissions to zero by 2025, and that a citizens' assembly be created to deal with the issue.

IRAQ
Baghdad Moves to
Bolster Saudi Ties
Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi traveled to Saudi Arabia this week and met with King Salman, in a sign of deepening relations between countries that for years had no diplomatic ties.
Mr. Abdul-Mahdi, accompanied by the ministers of oil, foreign affairs and electricity, met with Saudi officials and businessmen to discuss expanding commercial ties. On Wednesday, the two signed agreements in the fields of energy, power and education. But politicians and some analysts said the greater value of the trip was symbolic.
The two-day visit to Saudi Arabia comes amid heavy diplomatic traffic to and from Baghdad, as Iraq's leaders seek to redefine the country's position in the region following the campaign to defeat Islamic State. Ties have been improving since the U.S. began encouraging a rapprochement with a view to drawing Iraq into the Arab fold.
Since taking office six months ago, Mr. Abdul-Mahdi and President Barham Salih have sought to balance Iraq's relations with Tehran and Washington as the Trump administration tightens the screws on Iran with sanctions. In a press conference last week, Mr. Abdul-Mahdi said he had warned U.S. officials that designating Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization would destabilize the region.

Full text: Finland's Social Democrats were projected to have won a legislative election for the first time since 1999, edging out a nationalist movement in an election that echoed the polarization and populism seen elsewhere in Europe.
With 99% of Sunday's vote counted, the country's Justice Ministry said the Social Democratic Party was likely to have taken 17.7%. That relatively modest showing put the party in position to win after a campaign where debates over climate change, immigration and austerity prompted voters to embrace upstart parties.
Chief among them was the Finns Party, a fiercely anti-immigration movement that was seen taking 17.5% of the vote. In the county's 200-member Parliament, it is projected to hold one less seat than the Social Democrats. The governing Center Party, attacked by its rivals for introducing austerity measures, was set to finish fourth.
The likely outcome was that this Nordic nation was set to join larger neighbors like Sweden and Germany, where fractured electorates have made it difficult for winning parties to form a government. The Social Democrats haven't ruled out joining with the Finns Party, which has allied with nationalist parties including Alternative for Germany or Italy's League.
"Government negotiations are going to be difficult," said Jenni Karimaki, senior researcher at Finland's Turku University's Center for Parliamentary Studies. "Nobody is going to be the big winner."
For Europe, the election was a test of whether anti-immigration parties could continue to gain ground as the 2015 migrant crisis fades and the number of border crossings drops. The European Union holds parliamentary elections in May, with an alliance of nationalist parties promising to take control of the bloc. Sunday's vote was closely watched for signs of that alliance's staying power.
The Finns' strong showing demonstrates how anti-immigration parties can advance, even as immigration recedes as an issue. Sunday's election was primarily focused on climate change: The country's Greens Party, which also gained seats in Parliament, pledged to end consumption of almost all hydrocarbons in the next 20 years. Other parties introduced less-aggressive proposals. Greenpeace called it the climate election.
That created a political window for the Finns, which shifted its rhetoric toward skepticism of new environmental laws, arguing that measures in Finland made little, if any, difference on a global level.
"The political center. . .is not holding," said Mika Aaltola, professor of international relations at Estonia's Tallinn University. "This is a wider European tendency."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- New World Bank President David Malpass said he would support policies prohibiting financing of coal power plants as part of the institution's efforts to combat climate change.
"Climate change is a key problem facing people either through extreme poverty or through shared prosperity," Mr. Malpass said at a news conference on his first day in office. "My expectation is the bank will continue on the direction it has been pursuing."
The bank, which is the world's leading development finance institution, vowed in 2013 to stop directly financing the construction of coal power plants and in 2018 pulled out of its last such project, a potential loan guarantee for a plant in Kosovo.
The Trump administration, which nominated Mr. Malpass to the bank, has frequently bucked international efforts to reduce carbon emissions, most notably by withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate treaty. At the news conference, Mr. Malpass was asked if he might attempt to re-engage the World Bank in pursuing coal projects. "With regard to coal, the board and governors have established a policy on that and I don't expect a change in that policy," Mr. Malpass said.
Mr. Malpass was approved by the bank's board of directors last week. At the time of his nomination, he was the Treasury Department's undersecretary for international affairs.
Though the Trump administration has frequently been skeptical of multilateral and international institutions like the bank, Mr. Malpass has sought to reassure the bank's other member countries and staff of his support for the institution.

Full text: Many environmentalists have changed their minds about nuclear energy over the past decade. While the share of energy produced by solar and wind has grown rapidly, nuclear remains America's largest source of clean, zero-emissions electricity. Anyone seriously interested in preventing dangerous levels of global warming should be advocating nuclear power.
But two-thirds of U.S. nuclear plants in the U.S. are at risk of being closed prematurely and replaced by natural-gas generation, which is currently cheaper in many states. If that happens, carbon emissions could increase by an amount equivalent to adding 47 million new cars to the road.
Ideally, the federal government would solve this problem, but between Republican skepticism of climate change and Democratic opposition to nuclear energy, that's unlikely to happen before many nuclear-plant operators must decide whether to shut down. Thus the job of keeping these beleaguered nuclear plants open falls to state governments.
Lawmakers in Ohio and Pennsylvania are considering proposals to keep their nuclear plants operating. Ohio is at risk of losing two plants that produce 90% of its clean energy. Pennsylvania's five nuclear plants produce nearly as much electricity as do all of America's solar panels and farms. Nuclear accounts for 93% of the Keystone State's clean, zero-emissions electricity. If Pennsylvania and Ohio's nuclear plants close and are replaced by facilities that burn natural gas, it would be like adding 13.5 million new cars to the roads.
Nuclear plants can be saved through modest subsidies similar to the ones extended by lawmakers in Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and New York between 2016 and 2018. Those subsidies have been smaller than the federal subsidy that wind-energy generators have received for 27 years. In 2017 New York energy regulators gave nuclear power generators a subsidy of $17.34 per megawatt-hour. They also subsidized wind generators at $23 per megawatt-hour on top of the federal subsidy of $22 per megawatt-hour.
The fossil-fuel lobby's objections to nuclear power are understandable. The American Petroleum Institute wants to replace Ohio's and Pennsylvania's nuclear plants with natural-gas plants because its members stand to benefit. But why do groups that claim to be concerned about the climate oppose nuclear power?
Some Democratic lawmakers in Pennsylvania and environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council are urging state legislators not to subsidize nuclear without increasing subsidies for solar and wind. While combining subsidies for nuclear with subsidies for wind and solar worked to get legislation passed in New York and Illinois in 2016, such an approach risks backfiring in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where state lawmakers are more fiscally conservative and tend to be skeptical of renewables.
Saving nuclear plants won't be free, but keeping them open will keep electricity prices lower than if natural gas is allowed to dominate. Both Ohio and Pennsylvania still produce large amounts of electricity from coal, which is being replaced by natural gas. If both coal and nuclear plants are replaced by gas, ratepayers will be vulnerable to future price increases at the hands of monopolistic gas generators.
New York and California, meanwhile, are moving ahead with plans to close two nuclear plants. In the Empire State, Westchester County's Indian Point will close in 2021 and, on the West Coast, San Luis Obispo's Diablo Canyon will go offline in 2025. California is already set to miss its 2030 target of a 40% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels. If Diablo Canyon closes and half of its output is replaced by natural gas, there's no way they'll get there.
It is notable that while three natural-gas plants are being built to succeed Indian Point, local opposition to the construction of solar and wind farms has kept them from being built at anywhere near the rate necessary to replace the nuclear facility's output.
We've been here before. Environmentalists promised that solar and wind would replace output from California's San Onofre Generating Station, which closed in 2013, and the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant, which shut down the following year. Instead, they were replaced mostly by natural gas, and emissions rose in both states. At the rate Vermont is building new wind farms, it would take 474 years to match the electricity generation it lost from closing Vermont Yankee.
The problem isn't only that nuclear plants generate far more electricity. It's that solar and wind generate it only sporadically, which means they must be backed up by other sources of power 100% of the time. There is great hype about batteries, and using dams as pumped storage. But those solutions remain extremely expensive, which is why whenever nuclear plants close anywhere in the world, they are usually replaced by coal or natural-gas plants -- not solar, not wind and not batteries.
It doesn't have to be this way. The governors of California, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania can take actions to keep their nuclear plants operating. Governors in those states have in recent years urged more action out of Washington to address climate change. They'll have far more credibility and influence if they first take action in their home states.

Full text: The tropical cyclone that tore through Mozambique and other Southern African nations has spotlighted how the combination of rapid urbanization and climate change is turning deadly in some of the world's poorest places.
The cyclone, which devastated towns and killed hundreds of people, is shaping up to be one of the worst weather-related disasters in the Southern Hemisphere, the World Meteorological Organization said Tuesday.
Since making landfall late Thursday with wind speeds of up to 105 miles an hour, the cyclone, dubbed Idai, has swept through coastal Mozambique before moving inland into Zimbabwe, where it has killed at least 98 people. In Mozambique, the official death toll climbed above 200, but President Filipe Nyusi warned that it could easily pass 1,000 as the scale of the damage was only becoming apparent. In the days before, flooding from heavy rain had killed at least 56 people in Malawi.
The Red Cross said that 90% of the Mozambican city of Beira, a port on the Indian Ocean with a population of around 600,000, had been destroyed. Aerial footage showed entire neighborhoods inundated and hundreds of buildings stripped of their roofs. Aid groups reported using limited numbers of helicopters to pluck people from trees and drop food to those they couldn't reach.
"The damage is so severe, because the affected areas are densely populated," said Sergio Zimba, spokesman for Oxfam in Mozambique, one of dozens of charities scrambling to get help to the city. "Such disasters are more devastating in urban areas where basic infrastructure is absent."
The storm and the destruction it has left in its path have renewed questions about how poor countries with long coastlines are adapting to climate change -- and whether the rest of the world is helping enough. Global climate deals, including the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement, promised help for developing nations to shore up infrastructure and other technologies to protect their populations from rising sea levels and other effects of changing weather patterns.
But the level of funding and speed of projects coming online are lagging behind, especially as populations grow in poor countries and become increasingly urbanized. The Green Climate Fund, established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2009 to raise $100 billion a year by 2020 for climate-change adaptation and mitigation in poor countries, has so far received a mere $10.3 billion in pledges. It has started 102 projects, of which 43 are in Africa.

Full text: In the summer of 1212, thousands of divinely inspired young people from across Catholic France and Germany took off to liberate Jerusalem from the Muslims. None made it to the Holy Land. Many died along the way or were sold into slavery. As military campaigns go, the Children's Crusade was a disaster. Yet environmental activists and politicians are adopting the same "a child shall lead them" strategy to push their climate change agenda and its latest incarnation, the Green New Deal.
Youth-oriented climate groups have proliferated in the past few years, helped by logistical support from the United Nations. With earnest names such as iMatter Youth Movement, Zero Hour and Youth vs. Apocalypse, these outfits publicly lecture world leaders and march for the cause. This Friday has been designated "a global day of action" on which thousands of students world-wide are expected to strike -- otherwise known as cutting class.
A few of these youth groups are highly litigious, bringing lawsuits on the novel theory of "intergenerational equity." Most cases have been dismissed, although some continue to work their way through the courts, including Juliana v. U.S., filed in 2015 by Our Children's Trust.
Meanwhile, the Green New Deal has been introduced, appropriately enough, by the youngest member of Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It reads more like a progressive letter to Santa Claus than a serious piece of legislation.
Members of Congress not yet on board -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- are targets of adolescent Alinskys. Sen. Dianne Feinstein was recently ambushed in her San Francisco office by middle- and high-school students from the Sunrise Movement. To her credit, Mrs. Feinstein tried to explain to the youngsters that the Green New Deal would cost too much and would never pass into law. The exchange called to mind a grandparent laying down the law when the parents can't or won't do their job.
The Feinstein fiasco should give pause to the adult climate-change activists hiding behind -- and exploiting -- all of these doubtless sincere young people whose heads have been filled for years with frightening tales of climate disaster. Children are innocent, but innocence goes with inexperience, naivete and unwisdom. From following the Pied Piper into a medieval forest to sailing off with Pinocchio to Pleasure Island to shoplifting candy from Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, children tend to make bad choices, which is why we don't let them run things -- or vote, consume alcohol, drive cars or enter into contracts.
Anthropogenic global warming is a highly politicized, scientifically complex issue that still requires debate despite the purported consensus. Given the strategic importance of the nation's energy sector, any mitigation efforts would have wide-reaching economic and geopolitical ramifications.
Letting children lead the way on climate change would be a recipe for disaster. Remember the summer of 1212.

Full text: HOUSTON -- Some of the world's top oil executives plan a call to action at a premier industry conference this week, arguing that companies need to actively address climate change and technology concerns that are scaring investors away.
Rising climate activism, new technology and investor unrest have chastened and divided the global energy industry, a development set to define the CERAWeek by IHS conference, an annual gathering here that is usually dominated by a full-throated defense of fossil fuels.
The industry is facing a "crisis of confidence," Eldar Saetre, chief executive of Norwegian energy giant Equinor ASA, said in a speech Monday. BP PLC Chief Executive Bob Dudley is similarly planning in a Tuesday evening speech to call for the industry to do more to respond to new demands for climate action, even as energy use continues to rise.
"We need to drive this as an industry, to be part of the solution and not be dragged into a low-carbon future," Mr. Saetre said in an interview Sunday. While there are some good efforts to bring about change, he said, "there is definitely denial within companies and in boardrooms, as well as ignorance and an unwillingness to act."
BP's Mr. Dudley is set to deliver a warning about eroding trust, suggesting a "progressive but pragmatic" approach to providing more energy while reducing emissions, according to people familiar with his remarks. Mr. Saetre and Mr. Dudley both see more engagement with critics and young people as essential in response to anger and frustration about climate inaction.
Maarten Wetselaar, director of integrated gas and new energy at Royal Dutch Shell PLC, said in an interview Monday that "the industry as a whole is behind the curve" on preparing for a transition to lower carbon energy.
Shell is the only giant Western oil-and-gas company that has agreed to set goals to reduce emissions from the end use of its products, a step that was applauded by some activists but has also been questioned due to concerns that it could lead to reduced production of oil and gas. Shell executives acknowledge that the step will be a challenge but say it is necessary for society.
"How would we be a successful energy company in 2040 if we're not really good at providing our customers with low carbon energy?" Mr. Wetselaar said. "If you want to be a winner in this industry 20 years from now, that's the game."
Many oil-and-gas companies have been battered by investors in recent years because of volatile swings in prices. Energy stocks made up less than 6% of the S&P 500 at the end of last year, compared with about 15% a decade ago. The price swings and inconsistent performance in some business units, particularly in U.S. shale, have pushed some shareholders out of the sector.

Full text: Companies are under more pressure than ever to disclose their exposure to climate-change risks.
In the coming annual-meeting season, companies are projected to face a record 75 or more climate-related shareholder proposals, up from 17 in 2013, according to ISS Analytics, the data-intelligence arm of Institutional Shareholder Services. Investing powerhouses such as BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group are separately backing voluntary climate-change reporting standards for public companies and hope to prompt an uptick in disclosures this spring.
Annual meetings, which typically take place in the spring, are an opportunity for activist shareholders to put pressure on companies because of a process that allows them to submit proposals for a shareholder vote.
DowDuPont Inc., for instance, received a proposal for its 2019 proxy ballot that asked for more disclosures about risks from expanding chemical-plant operations near the Gulf of Mexico. Major storms there, such as Hurricane Harvey, can cause damage and spills. A spokesman for DowDuPont declined to comment.
Starbucks Corp. is facing pressure from both shareholders and its own environmentally conscious consumer base. Last year, 29% of Starbucks shareholders voted for the company to make public detailed plans about how it was going to promote reusable packaging and cut its use of plastic.
The proposal warned that Starbucks's reputation as an environmental leader could be hurt by its failure to meet its own sustainability goals. The proposal is on the company's 2019 proxy ballots. Starbucks's board of directors recommended against the proposal.
Beyond individual company initiatives, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors are among institutional investors backing the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a nonprofit organization that wants to standardize and increase corporate environmental disclosures. The group in November formally released a set of voluntary standards that companies can follow.
"What we're trying to do is maximize the value of the companies in the portfolio, protect the downside, and move the needle in a direction that we think reflects important material issues company by company," Barbara Novick, a BlackRock senior executive, said in a Feb. 7 Washington speech.
The Financial Stability Board, an international consortium of regulators, is tracking voluntary climate reporting and will issue a report in June.
JetBlue Airways was an early adopter of SASB's approach, launching its voluntary disclosures in 2016. In its 2017 sustainability report, the company said a rise in interest in climate issues followed years of especially volatile hurricane seasons in the Atlantic Ocean.
"For an airline like JetBlue with a significant focus in the Caribbean, the prospect of more extreme storms raises a legitimate concern: How prepared is JetBlue to deal with changing weather patterns that may be caused by climate change?" JetBlue's report said.
Some companies are taking an additional step by making climate-related pledges. Glencore PLC, one of the world's biggest coal producers, said in February that it would cap its output of the fossil fuel. Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Europe's largest oil-and-gas company, bowed to shareholder demands in December to set emission-reduction targets from the use of its products.
Some investors, Democratic politicians and environmental groups are pushing for mandatory disclosures. But the Securities and Exchange Commission so far hasn't required specific climate-related disclosures, instead telling companies to hew to broader criteria for what public companies must disclose as a material risk.

Full text: LONDON -- Glencore PLC, one of the world's biggest coal producers, said it is capping output of the fossil fuel as it faces growing pressure from investors over climate change.
The move marks a major reversal for a company that has invested billions of dollars in recent years to unearth more of the commodity and sell it in parts of the world where demand is surging. Even when its rivals had backed away from the fossil fuel, Glencore continued to double down, last year scooping up Australian assets from Rio Tinto PLC for $1.7 billion.
The Anglo-Swiss commodity trader said Wednesday it plans to limit its annual coal production at 150 million metric tons, toward the higher end of its target range this year, as it moves to align itself with evolving views on global warming. While that's more than Glencore's production of recent years -- last year, the company produced 130 million metric tons of coal -- its recent acquisitions indicated it likely had larger aspirations.
Among the world's biggest cheerleaders for coal in recent years is Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg.
Mr. Glasenberg took control of the firm's world-wide coal business in 1990 and spearheaded its dominant position in coal mining, snapping up operations in Colombia, South Africa and Australia. After Glencore completed its purchase of mining behemoth Xstrata PLC in 2013, the largest mining deal ever, Mr. Glasenberg said the deal was "a big play" on coal. Coal prices collapsed soon after, however, leaving investors wondering if Mr. Glasenberg, seen as one of the mining industry's most astute deal makers, had made a mistake. But prices more recently have surged, making coal among Glencore's most profitable commodities.
Mr. Glasenberg doesn't expect that to change soon.
"The coal market is extremely strong," he said on an August earnings call. "It's all holding well for coal going forward." On Wednesday, the CEO said he expects demand for thermal coal in Southeast Asia and elsewhere to remain robust.
The world's corporate giants are under growing pressure to shift away from fossil fuels that are blamed for contributing to climate change. Investor groups are pushing companies to invest in cleaner fuels.
Glencore's decision to limit coal production is exactly the kind of step investors have encouraged companies to make in order to avoid potentially more damaging impacts as the world moves to lower-carbon energy forms, said Anne Simpson, director of board governance and strategy at the California Public Employees' Retirement System. Ms. Simpson has played a central role in climate-related discussions with global companies.
"We want to make the shift from coal deliberate and strategic rather than waiting for the chaos of a market transition without any guardrails," she said.
Glencore is the latest company to agree to the investor demands, but many more are likely to follow as companies prepare for their annual meetings of shareholders in the coming months. Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Europe's largest oil-and-gas company, agreed in December to set targets to reduce the emissions from the use of its products, the first giant energy company to agree to such a step.
Among the world's largest Western oil companies, Shell is moving most aggressively to a future focused on natural gas, a strategy that has smoothed the path for its strident climate goals, since natural gas accounts for far lower emissions than crude and related products. None have taken steps to limit oil production, but BP PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and France's Total SA have all set various goals to reduce certain kinds of emissions.
BP has committed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations, and Chevron has moved to lower methane emissions and flaring. Both companies have tied the goals to compensation for employees. Total has made numerous investments in alternative sources of energy, along with Shell.
Exxon has also supported methane reduction and has given its financial backing to a U.S. lobbying effort to enact a carbon tax. BP, Shell and Total all support the measure.
BHP Group Ltd., a big producer of metallurgical coal used in steelmaking, last year left the coal industry's lobbying group, the World Coal Association, due to differences over their approach to climate change.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Republicans have seized on the "Green New Deal" in an effort to paint Democrats as extreme and out of touch on energy policy, attacking the proposal and launching advertisements tying swing-district Democrats to the idea.
Unveiled last week by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.), the Green New Deal aims to slow climate change by ending the reliance of the U.S. economy on fossil fuels within 10 years; to upgrade power grids and existing buildings for maximum energy efficiency; to overhaul transportation systems; and to provide every American with a job and health care.
The Green New Deal is a statement of goals and doesn't make specific policy proposals, nor does it specify how it would finance the enormous public investment it would require.
President Trump has mocked the proposal, joining a number of other Republicans who focused fire on the Green New Deal over the weekend.
The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House GOP leadership, launched two digital ads on Monday attacking the Green New Deal and two freshmen Democrats from competitive districts. Neither Reps. Antonio Delgado (D., N.Y.) nor Colin Allred (D., Texas), the targets of the two ads, has formally signed on to the legislation.
Nick Rahall, a former Democratic congressman from West Virginia, said the Green New Deal creates an opportunity for GOP political attacks. "This will not be forgotten by the Republican Party," he said. "They'll bring it up in every Rust Belt state they can and every district that is in play."
Democrats who support the plan say dramatic societal change is necessary to stave off the worst consequences of climate change. The U.S. Climate Assessment from scientists in the Trump administration warned last year climate change could cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year by the end of the century.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The past five years have been the hottest in modern records, federal scientists said Wednesday, the latest in a series of warnings as House Democrats promise to combat climate change.
Last year was the fourth-warmest year since 1880, according to the report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which track annual climate trends.
The record was set in 2016, followed by 2017 and 2015 -- with 2014 following 2018 as fifth among the hottest years on record. This century's repeatedly higher temperatures largely stem from greenhouse-gas emissions from human activities, the agencies added.
"The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt -- in coastal flooding, heat waves, intense precipitation and ecosystem change," Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, said in a news release from NASA summarizing the NASA and NOAA data.
The report comes after a year of extreme storms, floods and fires across the country. NASA scientists link such extreme weather to rising temperatures, saying that warming extends fire seasons and fuels bigger storms.
During 2018, the average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.42 degree F (0.79 degree C) above the 20th-century average, according to NOAA's report. It noted record-high temperatures across much of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East, and New Zealand and its surrounding ocean -- and across parts of Asia, the Atlantic Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean.
Nine of the 10 warmest years have now occurred since 2005, the NOAA report added. Also, 2018 was also the 42nd consecutive year these temperatures were at least nominally above the 20th-century average.
As the report was released, Democrats newly in control of the House held the Capitol's first hearings on climate change in years on Wednesday.
"Every day that we fail to act increases the costs of addressing this crisis for future generations," said Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, the new chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.
Republicans characterized the hearings as political theater without a clear objective. President Trump has cast doubt on mankind's role in climate change and the threat it poses, and his administration has rolled back policies aimed at limiting greenhouse-gas emissions.
Unchecked, climate change could cause U.S. economic losses totaling hundreds of billions of dollars a year by the end of the century through water shortages, floods and fires, November's U.S. National Climate Assessment said.

Full text: BOSTON -- State officials along the East and Gulf Coasts are pushing for projects valued at billions of dollars to protect populous coastal regions from rising oceans and extreme weather.
In Maine, Democrats are seeking a public vote on a $50 million bond to fund a steel waterfront infrastructure to protect against rising sea levels. Florida's new Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, recently proposed investing $2.5 billion to protect the Everglades and the appointment of a chief science officer to address environmental concerns. Louisiana's Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards pledged $55 million in state surplus and about $300 million in offshore oil revenue for coastal and levee improvements.
In Massachusetts -- where a tidal surge last year pushed the water level at Boston Harbor to the highest ever recorded, causing flooding -- Republican Gov. Charlie Baker proposed raising the tax on real-estate transfers by 50% in much of the state to generate more than $1 billion over the next decade. The funds would help local communities fortify infrastructure, from sea walls to flood-control systems.
The moves reflect a growing recognition by some lawmakers that communities aren't sufficiently prepared for increasingly intense storms and weather events that scientists attribute to rising sea levels and other major weather events that many scientists attribute to climate change.
About a third of the U.S. population lived in coastline counties along the Atlantic or Pacific oceans or the Gulf of Mexico in 2016, according to the Census Bureau. The number of residents along the Atlantic and the Gulf rose 15% to 60 million in 2016 from 2000.
Deadly storms that recently hit Texas, North Carolina, Florida, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and elsewhere highlight the risks. Major weather events cost more than $306 billion in 2017, breaking previous records, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Some plans are sparking debates about costs and who should bear the burden.
The Massachusetts Association of Realtors says Gov. Baker's proposed increase of the tax paid by sellers upon the transfer of property would make homes less affordable and that communities should fund their local resiliency projects. "It really comes down to a fairness issue," said Justin Davidson, the group's general counsel.
Geoff Beckwith, the executive director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, which represents 351 towns and cities, said many local officials have been enthusiastic about Gov. Baker's proposal. He said a state program would help ensure that every community can be prepared for severe weather -- not just those with more capacity to raise property taxes. "What we're trying to do is gird against what Mother Nature will do when it becomes more powerful," said Mr. Beckwith.
A January report by Moody's Investors Service said many of the largest U.S. cities are hastening attempts to cope with increased flooding and other climate-related risks. More governments will issue debt to prepare, the report predicted.
In some cases, previous debates over climate-change science are taking a back seat to concrete steps to combat severe weather.
"People everyday are seeing the effect that extreme weather is having on businesses, the economy, on infrastructure and human lives," said Carolyn Berndt, the program director for sustainability for the National League of Cities. "There is really no choice except to take action."
There isn't consensus everywhere. In North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper issued an executive order in October directing agencies to reduce energy consumption in state buildings by 40%, buy zero-emissions vehicles for the state fleet and develop plans to address climate change. But the GOP-led Legislature has been cool to the governor's plan.

Full text: PG&E Corp.'s bankruptcy could mark a business milestone: the first major corporate casualty of climate change. Few people expect it will be the last.
California's largest utility was overwhelmed by rapid climatic changes as a prolonged drought dried out much of the state and decimated forests, dramatically increasing the risk of fire. On Monday, PG&E said it planned to file for Chapter 11 protection by month's end, citing an estimated $30 billion in liabilities and 750 lawsuits from wildfires potentially caused by its power lines.
The company's fall has been fast and steep. In October, its market value was $25 billion. This past week, its value tumbled below $4 billion as its shares hit their lowest level since at least 1972.
The PG&E bankruptcy could be a wake-up call for corporations, forcing them to expand how they think about climate-related risks, management consultants and other experts said.
Previously, companies mainly worried over risks from new governmental regulations related to climate change, said Christophe Brognaux, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group. The PG&E case makes clear that companies also have to worry about sudden, and potentially unexpected, impacts to their core assets and liabilities, he added.
"Physical risks have only recently manifested themselves. This is a fairly new development," said Bruce Usher, a professor at Columbia University's business school who teaches a course on climate and finance. "If you are not already considering extreme weather and other climatic events as one of many risk factors affecting business today, you are not doing your job."
J. Bennett Johnston, a former Democratic U.S. senator from Louisiana who has served on Chevron Corp.'s board of directors, said the potential for climate change to damage company assets and cause a mushrooming of liabilities is an emerging enterprise risk.
"The business community, by and large, has gotten the message," he said. "You have to be pretty stupid not to see we're in the midst of a climate crisis and it's getting worse."
Climate wasn't the only factor that is pushing PG&E to a likely bankruptcy. State regulations also played a role. PG&E is required to provide electrical service to the thousands of people moving annually in the state's forested areas. Moreover, an unusual California state law, known as "inverse condemnation," made PG&E liable if its equipment started a fire, regardless of whether it was negligent.
PG&E capital spending plans are overseen by state regulators, who pressed the company to spend more on tree trimming but not, until a few months ago, on other fire-prevention measures such as early-warning weather stations and insulated wires.
PG&E's former chief executive, Geisha Williams, told an investor conference in January 2018 that policies such as inverse condemnation could undermine the financial health of utilities and make them unable to carry out aggressive efforts to combat carbon emissions. "This policy isn't affordable, and it isn't sustainable. Ultimately, it carries grave implications for the industry's financial health and our ability to attract the investment the state needs to fulfill its climate goals," she said.
PG&E announced on Jan. 13 that Ms. Williams was stepping down as CEO as the political and financial fallout from the wildfires continued to grow.
In less than a decade, PG&E, which serves 16 million customers, saw the risk of catastrophic wildfires multiply greatly in its vast service area, which stretches from the Oregon border south to Bakersfield. Weather patterns that had been typical for Southern California -- such as the hot, dry Santa Ana winds that sweep across the region in autumn, stoking fires -- were now appearing hundreds of miles to the north.
"The Santa Ana fire condition is now a Northern California fire reality," said Ken Pimlott, who retired last month as director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.
PG&E scrambled to reduce fire risks by shoring up power lines and trimming millions of trees. But the company's equipment kept setting fires -- about 1,550 between mid-2014 through 2017, or more than one a day, according to data it filed with the state.
PG&E has long accepted the science of climate change. It is one of several California utilities that, with prodding from state politicians, has been rapidly shifting to a cleaner energy future.
"Here was PG&E, the most 'woke' of utilities in terms of climate change," said John Geesman, a former executive director and then member of the California Energy Commission. "Shouldn't they have been adapting to climate change more rapidly than others?"
Other California utilities, such as Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric, began investing years ago in technology to shut off certain power lines during high fire-risk periods as well as changing the layout of their wires to lower the chance of inadvertently sparking fires during wind storms. PG&E, which state officials hadn't pushed to do the same, was far behind in these measures.
Extreme weather has led to a few bankruptcies in the past. In 2005, Entergy Inc. placed its New Orleans unit into bankruptcy after a liquidity crisis caused by the flooding that followed Hurricane Katrina. That was a much smaller utility and the flooding was a largely man-made problem of neglected levees and other infrastructure designed to protect the city.
The global business community is recognizing the risks it faces from climate change. This past week, a World Economic Forum survey of global business and thought leaders found extreme weather and other climate-related issues as top risks both by likelihood and impact.
"There is a general sense among policy makers, the general public and corporations that climate change is going to happen slowly," said Paula DiPerna, a senior advisor to CDP, an international nonprofit organization that presses companies to disclose their environmental impact.
"On the contrary, climate change is an extremely unpredictable series of events," she said. "And in the face of that, companies should be very prepared."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Navy is planning to expand its role in the Arctic as climate change opens up more ocean waterways and the U.S. vies with rivals Russia and China for influence in the far north.
A Navy warship will sail through Arctic waters in coming months on what is known as a freedom of navigation operation, or FONOP, said Navy Secretary Richard Spencer in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. It will be the first time the Navy has conducted such an operation in the Arctic.
The Navy also is planning to station resources in Adak, Alaska, which would mark a return to the onetime World War II and Cold War base that operated from 1942 to 1997. The new detachment could include surface ships and P-8 Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, he said.
"The concept is, yes, go up there," Mr. Spencer said, adding that plans for new Arctic operations are in early stages. "We're developing them as we speak," he said.
The Arctic has become a markedly more contentious military and commercial environment as the changing climate has led to greater ice melt, opening more navigable waterways and leading to greater sea traffic in once-impassable lanes.
The National Snow and Ice Data Center found that 2018 saw the third-lowest Arctic ice level since satellite data collection began in the late 1970s, part of an adverse trend the center says threatens to further accelerate global warming. This could open up more trans-Arctic maritime routes, according to the Government Accountability Office, allowing exploration of untapped petroleum reserves and threatening the borders of countries once insulated by thick ice off their coasts.
The U.S. and allies have used freedom of navigation operations to assert the rights of ships from the U.S. and elsewhere to operate freely where there are territorial disputes, hoping to discourage or counter excessive claims. Dozens of such operations in the South China Sea have targeted excessive Chinese maritime claims around islands and outposts.
Russia has long worked to develop its Arctic capabilities because of its lengthy northern coastline and use of Arctic waters for trade and national defense.
China issued a comprehensive Arctic policy last year that included a desire to build a "polar silk road" and ensure its freedom to operate in the region.
Adak, which sits at the end of the Aleutian Islands near Russia, once served as a U.S. naval facility and still has a functioning airstrip used for commercial flights. The base was closed in the 1990s as part of the Base Realignment and Closure Program, better known as BRAC.
The decommissioned naval station was taken over in 2003 by Aleut Corp., founded in the 1970s to settle Alaska-native claims against the federal government. With only a few thousand acres of the island still under government control, the Navy is currently in talks with the corporation, Mr. Spencer said. Aleut didn't respond to a request to comment.
"It has some amazing facilities," Mr. Spencer said. "Could we bring some surface ships there? Yes."

Full text: U.S. carbon emissions rose 3.4% in 2018, after three years of declines, as the effects of a strong economy outstripped a sharp drop in the number of power plants burning coal to generate electricity.
The increase in carbon emissions was the biggest jump since 2010, when the economy was rebounding from the recession, and the second-largest increase in two decades, according to the Rhodium Group. The independent research firm analyzed emissions across sectors, including power generation, transportation and manufacturing.
The U.S. had been among the world's few success stories, dramatically reducing emissions for several years as it moved away from coal-fired power during the Obama administration. Those reductions have started to level off and potentially now are in reverse.
Many countries have fallen far behind the pledges they made to cut emissions as part of the 2015 Paris climate accord. A U.N. report in November said more-ambitious commitments were needed globally to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change.
President Trump, a Republican, said last year he intends to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement.
U.S. efforts to cut carbon emissions have been helped in recent years by increased production of cheap natural gas, which produces far less carbon per unit of energy and has supplanted coal as the primary fuel used to produce electricity.
In the U.S., utilities were expected to have retired nearly 14 gigawatts of coal-fired power generation by the end of 2018, possibly a record, according to Tuesday's report. Meanwhile, natural gas use was up significantly. Natural-gas generation grew four times as fast as wind and solar combined through the first 10 months of 2018, the report said.
While most carbon-cutting efforts at the federal and state levels have been aimed at cleaning emissions from passenger cars and power plants, Trevor Houser, a climate and energy analyst at the Rhodium Group, said more focus should now be paid to areas like long-haul trucking, aviation and industrial production.
"Other sectors of the economy deserve the same amount of attention" through new technology development or regulation, he said.
As the economy grew last year, increased trucking and jet use led to a 3% increase in diesel and jet-fuel use in the transportation sector, which was the No. 1 source of carbon emissions for the third straight year.
Cold weather also played a role, with emissions from fuel oil, diesel and natural gas used to heat residential and commercial buildings rising 10%, to the highest level since 2004.
Overall, carbon emissions were still down 11.2% from 2005 levels.
To meet the Paris agreement target of reducing all greenhouse-gas emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025, the U.S. will have to cut those emissions by 2.6% on average over the next seven years, Rhodium Group said.
In its November report, the U.N. said global emissions showed no sign of reaching a peak.
Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, said the report showed that no single industry should be targeted for emissions reductions. "Efforts to demonize coal may have helped natural gas producers, but they weren't the answer to America's emissions challenge," she said. "The answer has to be innovation."

Full text: DRY VALLEYS, Antarctica -- They call it the Dreamcatcher. Its job is to help answer one of the most important and perplexing questions facing climate scientists today.
Dangling from a helicopter over Antarctica's frozen landscape, the giant hexagonal instrument sends out electromagnetic waves that penetrate the sheets of ice below, giving scientists something like an X-ray of an ancient body.
The scientists gathered here in Antarctica's Dry Valleys -- a rocky ecosystem dotted with frozen lakes and glaciers, some flowing into the sea -- want to know what lies beneath the ice. Is it rock? Or is it salty water?
The answer will have implications for communities, infrastructure and investments all over the world. Glaciers sitting atop briny water can be more prone to sliding off the land and into the ocean, potentially contributing to rising sea levels. Yet chief among the blind spots in climate models is the stability of the ice at the bottom of the world.
Scientists are confident that as the planet warms, Antarctic ice sheets will shrink, shedding the water they store. But how much of this continent's ice could end up in the ocean, and how quickly that might happen, are unknown. That in turn matters for the financial-services firms, asset managers and consultants that have been turning to climate models to assess risk and guide investment.
"The biggest question when it comes to sea-level rise is: How will the Antarctic ice sheets react to ongoing climate change?" says Ricarda Winkelmann, an ice-sheet modeler in Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
When Dr. Winkelmann talks to policy makers and business people, they want to know the worst-case scenario, and how fast will climate-related changes occur, she says.
The answers will come from the work of scientists like Jill Mikucki, Slawek Tulaczyk and Peter Doran, who spent weeks using the Dreamcatcher to map the underbelly of Antarctica's Dry Valleys. They are part of an ecosystem of polar researchers whose data provide the foundation for global climate models.
Antarctic scientists are gathering "some of the most high-priority data that needs to be taken," says Richard Rood, a professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
Climate models use measurements of the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, land and ice, sometimes going back more than 100 years, both to understand the climate's history and to predict its future. Scientists use mathematical equations that rely on these data to simulate physical phenomena such as rainfall and ocean currents.
They test how good these simulations are by doing "hind-casting." If the outputs match historical records, the model is considered accurate, and scientists can use it to study how the planet might react to future conditions.
If models' calculations don't match past observations or they fail to predict a future event, as they did with the sudden disintegration of Antarctica's Larsen B ice shelf in 2002, it is possible scientists are misunderstanding some crucial physical process or just don't have enough data.
Financial firms, including banks and insurance companies, are hiring climatologists and modelers and contracting with data-analysis firms specializing in climate science to help them apply climate data to business decisions.
Better ice dynamics data will help with "understanding the overall picture on climate change and the pace of change that's taking place," says Francis Condon, who focuses on sustainable investing for the global investment-management arm of Swiss bank UBS Group AG. "If there is an indication that the [sea] level is rising faster than previously indicated, that is an issue that needs to be considered from an investment perspective."
At the Asian Development Bank, which lends to governments and companies in Asia's developing markets, Jay Roop is part of a team that oversees the construction of wharves, ports and roads. To predict how projects might fare in future climate conditions, he and his team use 24 different climate models. The data they incorporate include melting rates of glaciers, historical ocean temperatures and rainfall, and information on local geography and water dynamics, which can affect storm surges. Most models don't have data on the stability of Antarctic ice.
Mr. Roop consulted climate models to assess a wharf the Papua New Guinea government wanted to build. Many models suggested that, without climate-proofing, the wharf would be underwater within a few decades. The design was reconfigured so the wharf could be easily raised. That increased the cost by roughly 17%. Construction will begin in late 2019.
A better sense of how the ice in polar regions is changing would narrow the "range of possible climate futures. . .which would give us more confidence in how we manage the risks that are being presented to us," says Mr. Roop.
Those who make investment decisions rely on proprietary climate data and publicly funded ice-sheet and global climate models. Some of the data incorporated into models is from large surveys that show what is happening across continents or the world's oceans.
Model builders using large-scale data can do no more than generalize about smaller-scale processes such as the effect of water on glaciers' stability. Smaller surveys like the one in the Dry Valleys are "absolutely necessary" to improve the accuracy of models, says Mathieu Morlighem, an ice-sheet modeler at the University of California, Irvine.
Drs. Mikucki, Tulaczyk and Doran are using the Dreamcatcher and on-the-ground measurements of the chemical properties of subglacial water to gain knowledge about ice-sheet behavior and Antarctic habitats never before gleaned from the continent's ice.
Dr. Mikucki, a microbiologist from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and her students collected samples from the outflows of saltwater at the Taylor Glacier. The water's high iron content washes the ice in red. They call it Blood Falls.
Dr. Mikucki wants to know what organisms live in the ferrous flows, which will help her understand the ecology of hidden briny water. When such water flows into the ocean, it can change water density, which in turn affects global weather patterns.
At Marble Point, a camp in the Dry Valleys, the three researchers took turns overseeing work with the Dreamcatcher. For weeks, they planned experiments and analyzed data from tents surrounded by glaciers, seals and scavenging birds called skuas.
To use the Dreamcatcher -- its formal name is SkyTEM -- a helicopter must fly it over the glaciers. Each mission can survey 150 miles.
The tool discriminates between different materials based on something called resistivity -- a measure of how easily electrical current can flow. Substances such as ice have high resistivity, meaning electricity doesn't flow through them easily. Water conducts electricity better. The saltier the water, the lower its resistivity.
Those differences allow the scientists to map subglacial topography. "It's transformative," says Dr. Mikucki.
The work in November, says Dr. Tulaczyk, provided "positive evidence" there is a lot of water beneath Antarctica's ice and land surface, including along the coast. Typically, such pockets of water act as a lubricant, making the ice more prone to sliding into the sea.
One surprise: Because of the way some glaciers evolved, especially in valleys below sea level, their undersides might be coated by ancient seawater whose chemistry has changed through interactions with rock and sediment over millennia. How much lubrication that provides has yet to be determined, Dr. Tulaczyk says.
He wants to study, he says, whether the "transformed seawater" has "the same capacity to impact the dynamics, the motion of the glaciers, as water that's generated by melting those glaciers themselves."
Combined with ice-flow data and climate archives in ice cores drilled from other areas of the continent, the information could yield new insights into the stability of Antarctic ice deposits, according to glaciologists and climate scientists.
Another group of scientists headed to Hercules Dome, roughly 250 miles from the South Pole, to look for 125,000-year-old ice. Their goal is to use that frozen record, which will take five to six years to unearth, to understand how the fragile West Antarctic Ice Sheet has reacted to past changes in climate, and at what rate. Roughly 125,000 years ago, it was much smaller than it is today, and sea levels were much higher.
The ice core this team is after should provide glaciologists and modelers critical clues about how sensitive this area is to changes in climate, according to Eric Steig, a University of Washington glaciologist who is part of the Hercules Dome expedition.
"The largest uncertainty in future sea-level rise is this problem," he says. "I can't imagine that won't affect insurance companies. . .if we narrow that one way or another."

Full text: Dharsono Hartono, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker, spotted what he thought was a new way to make a fortune 11 years ago: climate change.
The plan was to snap up rain forest in Borneo, preserve it from logging and sell carbon credits to big polluting companies in the developed world. The Earth's temperature was rising, and this was a way to profit by confronting the problem.
"From an investor perspective, from a real-estate perspective, this is a new asset class," Mr. Hartono said, describing his thinking at the time.
Investors around the world have poured money into assets like once-frozen farmland in Canada and groundwater basins in California, betting that warming temperatures will raise their value.
Another bet has been on what some investors hope will be the most profitable outcome of a warming climate: government regulation of carbon emissions. Those who correctly anticipate future government responses to climate change are likely to reap profits.
Mr. Hartono went in big. His company's rain forest, a humid and swampy expanse home to orangutans and clouded leopards, is twice the size of New York City and has one of the largest carbon stores of any such project in the world.
But the carbon windfall never arrived.
Mr. Hartono has sold just 20% of his credits to environmentally conscious corporations voluntarily buying credits and has lost around $20 million, burning through $5 million to $10 million a year in recent years.
Other investors in Indonesia and Latin America who made similar bets, including one backed by Australian bank Macquarie Group, failed to sell credits and abandoned their rain-forest projects.
Like the climate itself, governments are hard to predict.
"Unfortunately this is probably one of the hardest businesses" to be involved in, said Mr. Hartono. "It all really depends on regulation."
Things looked bright back in 2007. Mr. Hartono had returned home to Indonesia from the U.S. a few years earlier, where he earned a master's degree from Cornell University in financial engineering and worked in real estate for PricewaterhouseCoopers and JPMorgan.
His initial business plan was to buy up forest concessions to grow palm oil, the crop that is driving much of Indonesia's deforestation. Those plans changed after Rezal Kusumaatmadja, an old Cornell buddy and an environmentalist, persuaded him to attend a United Nations climate-change conference in Bali in 2007.
By then governments around the world were establishing markets that required polluting companies to purchase carbon credits to offset emissions, though no compliance market at the time accepted the international forest credits Mr. Hartono planned to produce.
He and Mr. Kusumaatmadja founded a company, PT Rimba Makmur Utama, and began securing rights to a stretch of Indonesian government-owned peat-rich rain forest. Instead of being a minor player in the palm-oil industry, Mr. Hartono would try to be a pioneer in a new green industry.
"If tomorrow suddenly people start buying carbon, this is going to be a home run," he thought at the time. He invested his own money in the project, with help from wealthy family members. International donors like the Clinton Foundation chipped in funding for projects such as mapping the local rain forest.
But Indonesia dragged its feet on granting permits, which Mr. Hartono had begun applying for in 2008. Only after actor Harrison Ford visited the project to shoot a documentary on climate change, and raised the issue with Indonesia's forestry minister, did final approval come for most of the concession in 2013. For an initial payment of around $3 million to the Indonesian government, Mr. Hartono's company gained the rights to the forestland for 60 years.
By then, however, some environmentalists were questioning private carbon-selling projects like Mr. Hartono's. They argued that buying up and preserving rain forest to sell credits wouldn't decrease net deforestation, since palm-oil barons would simply work around the few protected plots in the forest.
U.S. legislation that would have put a price on carbon failed during the Obama administration. The European Union's carbon market doesn't include tropical forests amid worry that low-cost credits generated there would make it affordable to pollute.
Some specialized investors were intrigued, however, and gave Mr. Hartono enough cash to stay in business for several years. "It's not about short-term profitability," said Stephen Rumsey, chairman of Permian Global. "We think the market will get there." Mr. Rumsey, who co-founded European Credit Management Limited, which grew to have $30 billion under management before being sold to Wells Fargo & Co., declined to say exactly how much he put in.
Deep in rain-forest villages accessible only by motorboat, Mr. Hartono's company got to work. It trained former loggers in new livelihoods, such as how to climb coconut trees to harvest sap for sugar. To protect the forest from dry-season burning, it paid locals to enlist in firefighting brigades.
Madona Melly Melani, 23, a local villager, received a small loan from Mr. Hartono's company to boost her small business selling fried snacks. She was glad the company didn't burn the forest and pollute local rivers, as some palm-oil companies had done in the past.
"I don't really understand the concept of their business but I'm glad they take care of the forest," she said.
While most of the credits lie fallow on Mr. Hartono's balance sheet, there have been some purchases. Kering, a Paris-based luxury retailer, and Itoki, a Japanese furniture company, bought credits out of a sense of environmental obligation. They might also prove useful if regulation changes in the future.
There may be other sources of demand. The International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. body that governs airlines, plans to require international carriers to offset excess carbon emissions after 2020. So far 76 countries, including the U.S., have indicated an intention to participate.
The Paris climate accords are expected to lead to an international carbon market after 2020, where countries that exceed emissions targets can purchase offset credits from countries that reduce emissions beyond their targets, potentially opening up new opportunities for Mr. Hartono.
"As an entrepreneur you start to see there's a light at the end of the tunnel," he said.
"At the moment, Dharsono's is one of the only projects still running," said Dewi Rizki, an Indonesian environmentalist who developed a short-lived forest project in Borneo with Macquarie. "Dharsono is crazy enough to wait."

Warming Seas Send Waves Through U.S. Fishing --- Alaskan pollock retreats; black sea bass booms in Rhode Island

Full text: The fish are moving, and so is an entire industry.
Aboard the Stanley K and the Oracle, two 58-foot vessels, Buck Laukitis and his crews chase halibut across the Bering Sea worth $5 a pound at the docks. As sea temperatures rise and Arctic ice retreats, the fish appear to be avoiding warming waters, migrating northward where they cost more to reach, federal fisheries biologists say.
Twice this past fall, the Oracle sailed 800 miles north from the seaport of Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands, before finding the halibut that a decade ago lived several hundred miles closer to home. Each voyage took twice as long and yielded half as many fish.
"It keeps me up at night," he says. "I woke up at three in the morning. I couldn't sleep thinking about where the fish are going."
Across the continent from Mr. Laukitis in Rhode Island, black sea bass have moved in with the warming waters. The bulk once lived roughly 700 miles south off North Carolina. Now they are a staple catch in Point Judith, R.I., along with the summer flounder that also have begun appearing.
"Not everybody is a loser in global warming," says Aaron Gewirtz, owner of a 45-foot trawler in Point Judith, who says his bottom line has been shored up by the newcomers. "Some species really dig it. And black sea bass is one of them."
Mr. Gewirtz, a "gill netter" who uses gear designed to catch fish by the gills or fins, has capitalized on shifts in fisheries by getting federal permits to catch almost anything with fins: cod, haddock, winter flounder, monkfish, scup, skate, black sea bass. A few decades ago, he says, a gill netter would concentrate on one fish. Today, "we try to be as diversified as possible in what we catch."
The impact of climate change has a price, and for fishing-boat owners in sea ports, that means following the catch. The northward movement of fish around the world is disrupting some fishing grounds and revitalizing others -- and fishing businesses are trying to adapt operations.
The impact of temperature on oceans is varied. As the atmosphere warmed in recent decades, oceans absorbed heat unevenly, causing marine hot spots that can last months, scientists say. Spikes of warmer water affect fisheries differently depending on ocean currents, ocean depth and seafloor topography.
Higher temperatures mean less dissolved oxygen in the water while increasing a fish's demand for oxygen by speeding up its metabolism. Warming water may also favor predators or drive off species on which commercial fish feed. Warming ocean temperatures are pushing hundreds of marine species outside of their traditional ranges, ocean scientists say.
Off Portugal's coast, fishermen harvest fish that a decade or so ago lived only in waters off Africa, according to a study published in 2016 in the journal Fisheries Research. In 2011, mackerel for the first time appeared off Greenland's coast, according to marine biologists in Iceland and Norway.
"We have seen mackerel extending its feeding area into Icelandic waters," says Birkir Bardarson, who oversees a research fleet at Iceland's Marine and Freshwater Research Institute. "It has become important for the fisheries of Iceland."
Climate change has created an especially stark contrast of fortunes between fishers in Alaska and Rhode Island. In the Bering Sea, halibut, pollock and cod are moving away. Off Rhode Island, newly booming fisheries include not just black sea bass but also squid and Jonah crab, an edible species with big, dark-brown claws.
In Alaska's multibillion-dollar commercial fishing industry, representing America's largest wild-caught seafood harvest, federal fishery experts worry most about the impact of rising temperatures on pollock, considered the single-most-valuable fish by volume in the U.S.
Ships scoop Alaska pollock from shimmering schools in the Bering Sea in 1,200-foot-long nets, 100 tons or more at a time, then clean, process and freeze them aboard. The meat is trimmed, battered and breaded by processors into millions of fish sticks and fast-food filets a day. It is minced into paste called surimi for imitation crab, ground for animal feed and pressed into oil. Franz Mueter, who studies climate change and fisheries at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, says: "It is the billion-dollar fish."
Fishermen and marine scientists who study Alaska fisheries are used to natural variations in ocean circulation patterns. But starting in 2000, warm and cool spells lasted longer, federal weather records show. Temperatures rose to records and plunged to bitter lows.
In 2016, St. Paul Island in the Bering Sea registered its warmest year on record, 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit above average. Last year, spring and summer temperatures across the Arctic generally were cooler, but the annual average surface temperature was the second highest on record, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's annual Arctic Report and the Alaska Climate Research Center at the University of Alaska.
"That was highly unusual and was not something we had ever seen in the Bering Sea before," says Janet Duffy-Anderson, who helps monitor the commercial fishery for the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. She is part of a federal catch-management system that uses annual fish sampling, ocean surveys, ecosystem studies and computer models.
This year, the winter ice that normally covers the northern Bering Sea never formed and, for the first time since the surveys started 34 years ago, a vast pool of cold bottom water that normally kept many fish at the southeastern end of the Bering Sea was gone.
Marine scientists once thought Alaska pollock would thrive in warmer waters. Across the Arctic Circle in the Barents Sea, a pollock relative, Atlantic cod, doubled its numbers recently as water temperatures soared. Instead, federal ocean scientists in a Bering Sea survey earlier this year found pollock and cod were concentrating farther north than ever, likely out of easy reach of all but the best-equipped trawlers.
Managers at Aleutian Spray Fisheries Inc. in Seattle, which typically harvests 40,000 to 50,000 tons of pollock from the Bering Sea annually, decided in 2015 to build in more flexibility to meet shifting market demand and fishery conditions. They hauled their 1,000-ton 240-foot factory trawler, the Starbound, into dry dock and cut it in half. They welded it back together after inserting a 60-foot-long addition to accommodate more processing equipment, designed to expand the range of products they can make at sea.
"We wanted to make our vessel as versatile as possible," says company executive Craig Cross. "It's a response to different markets and different fish conditions, which includes climate."
A crew of 130 working 16-hour days can now process around 450 metric tons of fish daily aboard the renovated Starbound, about 100 metric tons more a day than before renovating the ship. The three computer-driven production lines can each clean, debone and trim filets at about 180 fish a minute. They can now also produce fish meal, surimi and fish oil while still at sea. "We are able to mix and match our product to demand right onboard," says Starbound captain Karl Bratvold.
On its most recent fishing trip on the Bering Sea, it brought back 160 tons of frozen fish filets, 24 tons of fish meal and 6,000 gallons of fish oil, with an average trip now worth $3.8 million, compared with $3 million per trip before the conversion, he says.
"We are definitely seeing changes in what's happening out on the ocean," says Doug L. Christensen, president of Arctic Storm Management Group in Seattle, a company that harvests about 90,000 tons of fish yearly from the Bering Sea. In pursuit of pollock this year, his ships have been traveling 60 or 70 hours out of Dutch Harbor, he says, instead of 20 hours or so as in years past, adding an extra 5,000 gallons or so of fuel to each voyage.
To control his operating costs, he moved from two trawlers to a single highly automated vessel. The new ship will have eight filleting production lines and freezer capacity for 2,500 tons of fish -- twice the capacity of one of his current vessels. Labor and fuel costs will be lower, he says.
In Rhode Island, fishers are there to benefit as species move in. Not so long ago, the lobstermen of Point Judith threw away Jonah crabs that got tangled in traps. Now, lobsters have shifted into deeper, cooler waters off shore and the crab have become a commercial mainstay, says Thomas Heimann, a research associate at the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation in Saunderstown, R.I.
"It wasn't even a fishery 10 years ago," he says. "It is pretty huge now."
U.S. landings of Jonah crab are about 17 times what they were 20 years ago, according to the NOAA Report on U.S. Fisheries. Rhode Island lobstermen are buying wider boats to take advantage, building bigger deck tanks to hold the catch and investing in federal permits to gain access to the fishery.
To take advantage of growing Jonah crab supplies, Bonnie Hardy is converting a warehouse in East Providence into a crab-processing plant she hopes to open in January for her seafood startup. "How am I adapting to warming currents? Right now my adaptation is that I am setting up a food processing facility," she says. "There is opportunity there."
Meanwhile, squid have become so important to the Rhode Island economy that the legislature recently voted calamari the state's official appetizer. The U.S. catch of Illex squid, usually used in calamari, tripled between 2016 and 2017, according to the NOAA Report. Richard Fuka, who builds boats and repairs commercial fishing vessels in Point Judith, says he has seen business thrive as a result.
"The huge winner in warming waters," he says, "is the squid fisherman of Rhode Island."
Then there's the black sea bass. The local commercial sea-bass fishery tripled in value during the past nine years, largely due to the influx of new fish, according to state environmental officials. Federal fishery restrictions, which don't account for recent shifts in species due to warming waters, block local fishermen in Rhode Island and other Northeastern states from taking full advantage of the record numbers. There have been challenges to the existing quotas but it may take years to reallocate them.
Now it is fishermen from farther south who must sail farther to catch them. Jimmy Ruhle, owner of a 95-foot trawler, has been fishing from North Carolina to New England for 54 years.
Over the last 25 years, he says, he has seen summer flounder and black sea bass shift their range 600 to 700 miles or so north from where he once caught them as a young man, in response to warming water temperatures and shifts in the Gulf Stream.
To stay profitable, Mr. Ruhle has shifted northward too, and that means higher fuel costs. As a result, Mr. Ruhle has branched out into harvesting squid off the coast of Rhode Island, which he can unload locally.
Federal fishing quotas let commercial fishermen from the south such as Mr. Ruhle catch more black sea bass in northern waters than local fishers are allowed, because Mr. Ruhle and others like him are registered in southern ports where the black sea bass fishery was concentrated decades ago when the federal quotas were set. Even so, they must unload their haul in their legal home ports.
Mr. Ruhle steams south to unload in Virginia and North Carolina. "We had to travel 1,300 miles in 11 days to get the catch we were allocated," he said Sunday, after docking in Hampton at the end of his most recent fishing trip. "All of the fish we caught this year could easily have been taken off Virginia 25 years ago," he said. "It has been that significant a shift in those species."

Full text: Despite White House pushback against the Paris climate accord, U.S. negotiators played a significant role in driving a compromise effort to establish a new rulebook to curb global warming.
Negotiators from around the world agreed on Saturday on guidelines that would bolster the 2015 accord amid concerns countries would fail to deliver on commitments to fight what many scientists call a rising threat from climate change.
President Trump decided last year to pull out of the agreement and an increasing number of countries have followed him in questioning it. But behind the scenes, engagement by Washington highlighted U.S. interest in shaping global rules even as the administration walks away from international deals.
The U.S. shift at the talks in Katowice, Poland, was evident. The U.S. hosted an event on the sidelines to promote fossil fuels, including coal. Washington also joined Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait in weakening a motion to welcome an October U.N. climate report warning of irreversible changes in 12 years if global warming isn't limited.
But simultaneously, U.S. negotiators participated in crunch discussions past the summit's Friday close to secure a deal.
"The U.S. is half-in, half-out," said Bas Eickhout, a Dutch lawmaker with the European Green Party in the European Parliament and former U.N. climate report contributor. "On the political level, they will be obstructive. On the technical-negotiations level they will usually be good in drafting compromise language."
The State Department said the U.S. participates in climate change talks to protect its interests.
"U.S. negotiators -- a dedicated group of professionals from across the federal government -- worked tirelessly to advance core U.S. interests and worked with partners to identify ways to level the playing field for U.S. businesses," a spokesman said.
The compromise marked an effort to bridge longstanding gaps between rich and poor countries on curbing greenhouse-gas emissions, an issue global leaders led by President Obama and China's Xi Jinping delayed addressing to clinch the Paris accord.
Negotiators agreed on wording on transparent reporting requirements for greenhouse-gas emissions and progress toward curbing such releases. But Saturday's talks failed to reach consensus on more-ambitious targets to curb emissions, putting off the discussion until a September summit on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
They also failed to reach a deal on what has been called the "unsung hero" of the Paris pact: a global carbon market pushed by China, the European Union and California.
The EU's 28 countries have pledged more money and resources than any other party to the pact, providing 20.4 billion euros ($23.1 billion) in 2017 alone. China doesn't contribute financing, and Mr. Trump said the U.S. would cease the "draconian financial and economic burdens" of the accord.
"We strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability," Mr. Trump's senior adviser on energy and climate affairs, Wells Griffith, said in Katowice.
Protesters disrupted Mr. Griffith's speech, unfurling a banner depicting oil- and gas-drilling wells.
Brazil introduced language to the draft rulebook that effectively derailed provisions on creating an international carbon market, officials and environmental organizations said. To avoid derailing the rulebook, the U.S., EU, China and Brazil brokered a compromise that delayed discussions on international cooperation and accounting terms until a climate summit in Chile next November.

Countries Pledge
Tougher Targets
The High Ambition Coalition, a group of countries that includes the EU and two dozen Paris-agreement signatories, pledged to raise their emission-reduction targets by the end of 2020.
That means exceeding the pact's commitment to keep global warming "well below" two degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, in an effort to cap postindustrial temperature increases at 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The difference of a half degree Celsius, or 0.9 degree Fahrenheit, will determine whether some ecosystems live and major cities avoid flooding, among other drastic changes, said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The U.N. scientific body, known as IPCC, assesses thousands of research papers published annually.
"Every extra bit of warming matters," said Hans-Otto Portner, of the IPCC working group that drafted the U.N.'s October report. "Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes."

Full text: Corrections & Amplifications
A map accompanying a Page One article on Tuesday about Harvard's investments in California misspelled the name of the city Morro Bay as Morrow Bay.
(WSJ December 13, 2018)
SHANDON, Calif. -- Steve Sinton, a rancher, was baffled when a company he'd never heard of began buying large tracts of agricultural land near his pastures at above-market prices. The firm, Brodiaea Inc., over a few months in 2012 acquired more than three square miles of a flat-bottomed valley.
"It was surprising, the prices they were willing to pay," says Mr. Sinton, a partner in a family-owned ranch that raises cattle and grows grapes. A conventional agricultural business's returns couldn't have justified those prices. "It didn't make sense to me."
Brodiaea's drilling permits and property purchases were signed by Matt Turrentine, a local who had recently left his family's grape-brokerage business. He wouldn't say who was behind the investment, Mr. Sinton and other locals say. The firm bought more acreage, drilled deep-water wells and began planting vineyards capable of producing billions of grapes annually.
One thing was clear. Brodiaea was willing to pay a premium for land that had good access to groundwater, an increasingly valuable resource given that aquifer levels elsewhere in San Luis Obispo County had fallen steeply. "We didn't know who Brodiaea was," says Sue Luft, a retired environmental engineer who lived nearby, "but we knew it was big money."
They got the answer in 2014, in a real-estate newsletter article about the buyer. It was Harvard.
The university's endowment manager, Harvard Management Co., was stealthily building a sizable grape-growing business on the Central Coast through entities including Brodiaea. With the land, it was acquiring rights to vast sources of water in a region where the earth's warming is making the resource an ever-more-valuable asset.
Drought has plagued California in recent years, hitting farmers particularly hard. The Central Coast experienced drought conditions for 30% of the past two decades, compared with 14% of the prior 100 years, a 2015 study found. Droughts have led to spikes in withdrawals from aquifers, many of which aren't recharging as much during rainy season, says study co-author Noah Diffenbaugh, a Stanford University professor.
Harvard's bet has proven prescient. The $39 billion fund, among America's biggest endowments, now values its vineyards at $305 million, up nearly threefold from in 2013.
The wager has also earned backlash from some locals who fear Harvard eventually will use up groundwater and unduly influence water-use regulations. "Should they be controlling our groundwater plans?" says Debbie Arnold, a San Luis Obispo County supervisor. "I don't think so." Others, like Mr. Sinton, are less concerned, pointing out that some earlier crops were thirstier than grapes.
A Harvard Management spokesman says it is the endowment's policy not to discuss individual investments. In its financial report issued in 2012, the year Brodiaea began buying, Harvard said it liked the natural-resources asset class "because we believe its physical products are going to be in increasing demand in the global economy over the coming decades."
In a warming planet, few resources will be more affected than water, as droughts, storms and changes in evaporation alter a flow critical for drinking, farming and industry.
Even though there aren't many ways to make financial investments in water, investors are starting to place bets. Buying arable land with access to it is one way. In California's Central Coast, "the best property with the best water will sell for record-breaking prices," says JoAnn Wall, a real-estate appraiser specializing in vineyards, "and properties without adequate water will suffer in value."
Investors who see agriculture as a proxy for betting on water include Michael Burry, a hedge-fund investor whose wager against the U.S. housing market was chronicled in the book and movie "The Big Short." In a 2015 New York Magazine interview, Mr. Burry was quoted as saying: "What became clear to me is that food is the way to invest in water. That is, grow food in water-rich areas and transport it for sale in water-poor areas." He declined to comment.
David Gladstone, chief executive of Gladstone Land Corp., a farmland-investment trust, says the recent California drought was profitable for his company and tenant farmers because they had access to water while others didn't. The changing climate has made control of water more valuable, he says.
In California vineyards, the water-proxy math is compelling. When grapes are harvested, about 75% of their weight is water. Owning vineyards effectively turns water into revenue.
Water has long been contentious in California. Climate change is making the situation worse, scientists and state officials say. The Sierra Nevada snowmelt that satiates much of the state has become harder to count on.
In 2011, San Luis Obispo County issued a report with a map showing in deep red -- a "red zone," locals call it -- where groundwater had fallen more than 70 feet. "We're having more heat and more drought," says Willy Cunha, a vineyard manager in the county. That has put a premium on land with good water, he says. "It is like California beachfront property. God isn't making any more."
Harvard's foray harks back to 2012, when Mr. Turrentine and James Ontiveros, a local vineyard manager, founded agricultural investment advisory firm Grapevine Capital Partners LLC and pitched the idea to Harvard. Harvard signed on.
Grapevine Capital "identified an area where the groundwater is very good, and it's outside the red zone," says Tony Correia, an agricultural-land appraiser specializing in vineyards. Wine-industry writer Rusty Gaffney wrote in 2015 that Mr. Ontiveros had spoken to him of the land Grapevine steered Harvard toward, telling him "the region had sufficient underground water aquifers to be successfully farmed despite recent climate changes and drought conditions." Mr. Turrentine says he doesn't have permission from Harvard to discuss the investments. Mr. Ontiveros didn't respond to requests for comment.
The land Grapevine identified for Harvard was south of Shandon, 190 miles northwest of Los Angeles. The groundwater in this area was much easier to tap than in other grape-growing operations that form the heart of the Paso Robles wine region, according to reports from the local groundwater agency. It was relatively close to the surface.
In June 2012, Mr. Turrentine filed paperwork to create Brodiaea -- the scientific name for a type of lily -- which was wholly owned by Harvard, although those filings didn't show that. In July, Brodiaea bought its first property in the county. It generally bought unlisted properties, many of them carrot farms, local brokers say. By autumn, Brodiaea had pieced together about 3,000 acres and started to plant vineyards.
In 2013, several residential wells ran dry between Paso Robles and Shandon, roughly 10 miles west of Harvard's vineyards. The general consensus was that the drought led vineyards to pump more well water. Residents began attending county meetings demanding action in the groundwater basin, which included Harvard's land.
The county supervisors issued an emergency moratorium on new agricultural wells -- not just wells in the affected areas but also in areas such as Harvard's holdings where groundwater hadn't fallen as much.
The day before the moratorium took effect, Harvard's Brodiaea filed for permits to drill seven wells deeper than anything else in that part of the county. One well hit water at 112 feet, but the driller completed the well to 1,200 feet deep, county records show. This would allow it to keep drawing water, even if droughts dropped the groundwater level further.
About four months later, Harvard filed paperwork to create a new entity, SLO San Juan Road LLC. Messrs. Turrentine and Ontiveros's firm, Grapevine, acted as the agent for the new entity. Through SLO, Harvard continued buying property south of Shandon. In early 2014, Brodiaea bought an 8,700-acre cattle ranch in the nearby Cuyama Valley. Harvard's firms continued to plant rootstock on its Shandon-area properties.
In March 2014, the Farmland Investor Letter revealed that Harvard was backing Brodiaea. Some local residents were vocally upset, saying that Harvard and Mr. Turrentine were positioning themselves to have an outsize influence on the future of groundwater use.
In 2016, rigs hired by Brodiaea began to drill 12 water wells on its Cuyama Valley property.
Cindy Steinbeck is a vineyard owner whose family had grown grapes in the area for five decades. She wrote to Harvard Management's president in March 2016 saying its use of limited-liability companies "seems designed to obfuscate Harvard's activities in the area."
"Such an investment does not make economic sense," she wrote, noting above-market prices Harvard was paying, "if your intent is simply to grow and sell grapes. It would, however, make perfect sense if the investment wasn't for farming but rather for the brokering of water." A Harvard official responded that its investment was "purely agricultural in nature" and that the vineyards prioritized water conservation. She says she remains concerned.
Kat Taylor, an environmentalist and wife of hedge-fund billionaire and liberal activist Tom Steyer, resigned earlier this year from Harvard's board of overseers in protest of the endowment's investments in things such as fossil fuels and water holdings she says threaten the human right to water.
"It may, in the short run, be about developing vineyard property," she says of Harvard's California investments. "In the long run, it was a claim on water."
Harvard's investing guidelines say respecting local resource rights are of increasing importance "in the coming decades as competition for scarce resources, such as arable land and water, intensifies due to increasing global population, climate change, and food consumption." All plans Harvard has filed indicate it intends to use its water to grow grapes.
In 2014, California experienced its warmest year on record. Gov. Jerry Brown, seeking to preserve groundwater, signed sweeping legislation to prevent depletion. It identified 20 "critical" basins, including those under Harvard's vineyards, that needed to develop plans by 2020 to limit groundwater drawdowns.
To help write those water plans, large landowners in Shandon voted in 2017 to create their own water district governed by a five-member committee. Mr. Turrentine was elected to the committee, giving Harvard a voice in the planning.
The groundwater basin in nearby Cuyama Valley was also on the "critical" list. Mr. Turrentine's Grapevine hired hydrologists to argue that there was a geologic fault separating Harvard's Cuyama vineyards from the rest of the basin. So far, the state has disagreed.
Roberta Jaffe, who with her husband, Steve Gliessman, runs a small family vineyard and olive orchard nearby, is concerned warming weather is already making water more scarce and valuable. She worries Harvard could seek to send water toward cities in Southern California.
Harvard has applied to build three large lined reservoirs on its Cuyama Valley vineyard and is waiting to hear from county officials. Ms. Jaffe and others have argued against it.
At a meeting this autumn of the local planning commission, Brodiaea consultant David Swenk said the company was within its rights. "A farmer has a right to farm," he said, "and can utilize the water under their property."

Full text: LONDON -- Royal Dutch Shell PLC plans to set short-term carbon-emissions targets and link them to executive pay, the company said Monday, capitulating to months of investor pressure.
The decision marks a step toward delivering on ambitious long-term climate goals by one of the world's biggest oil companies, though details regarding Shell's exact plans remain vague.
The company said it would provide three- to five-year targets beginning in 2020 to reduce its net carbon footprint on an annual basis. It plans to incorporate the targets into a revised remuneration policy, which will be subject to a shareholder vote in 2020.
The move marks an about-face in Shell's view on targets, and comes after long-term goals to reduce the company's carbon footprint -- including emissions by drivers who burn Shell fuel -- faced criticism for lacking more immediate accountability.
As recently as May, Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden defended the company's stance and pushed back against firm targets, describing them as "onerous and cumbersome."
But months of engagement with institutional investors have helped soften the company's outlook, sending a clear signal to other big oil companies about the kind of pressure and investor demands they can expect to face going forward.
Shell's commitments, though still vague, might supply an industry benchmark. They "provide a model for others across the sector to follow," said Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a European forum for investor collaboration on climate issues that represents investors with over 21 trillion euros ($23 trillion) in assets under management.
While other large European oil companies have already set near-term targets to reduce emissions, Shell's long-term goals are among the most ambitious in the industry. Its plans to link those targets to executive pay also put it at the forefront of industry action on climate change.
For instance, Norwegian oil company Equinor ASA, formerly known as Statoil, already counts the carbon intensity of its oil and natural-gas production as a key metric when deciding its chief executive's pay. But Shell's plans could make it the biggest oil company yet to link executive pay to specific climate targets.
The company has also suggested that its new compensation structure could go further than competitors' existing policies, requiring Shell executives to meet ambitious commitments that incorporate total emissions associated with the company.
The announcement comes as governments meet in Poland for climate-change talks to complete rules for how the Paris Climate Agreement will be implemented.
Investors have also been stepping up their engagement with companies, reflecting concerns over the risks associated with holding fossil-fuel producers.
Shell's announcement was made in conjunction with Climate Action 100+, a group of more than 300 investors with over $32 trillion in assets under management. Launched last year, the group's aim is to push the biggest corporate emitters to cut emissions and improve disclosure and governance on climate issues.

New Evidence Found
On Rohingya Genocide
The military's mass killings of the Rohingya minority amount to genocide, according to the law firm hired by the U.S. government to investigate the crisis, a finding that raises pressure on the U.S. to impose harsher sanctions against the country.
The State Department this year commissioned the Public International Law and Policy Group to send a team to Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh to document Myanmar's military campaign last year.
Investigators interviewed 1,024 refugees, recording numerous instances of grave human-rights violations, including mass rapes, beheadings, and the burning and drowning of children, according to a September report by the law firm.
The State Department has classified the killings as ethnic cleansing and not as genocide, which under international law is a crime of its own.
On Monday, the group concluded there are "reasonable grounds to believe" genocide was committed.

UNITED NATIONS
Guterres Says Climate
'Most Important Issue'
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed to world leaders to take the threat of global warming seriously and to act boldly to avert a catastrophic rise in temperatures before the end of the century.
Mr. Guterres, who spoke at the opening of the U.N. climate conference in Poland, called climate change "the most important issue we face."
"Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption," Mr. Guterres told delegates from almost 200 countries in the city of Katowice.
The U.N. chief chided countries, particularly those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, for failing to do enough to back the 2015 Paris climate accord, which set a goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) -- ideally 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) -- by the end of the century.

CONGO
WHO Says It Can
Fight Ebola Alone
The head of the World Health Organization said it can fight the deadly Ebola outbreak in Congo despite the withdrawal of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The comments by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus came after two medical journals appealed to the CDC to return to the epidemic zone in Congo -- saying its expertise is needed. The U.S. experts have been sidelined for weeks, ordered away from the region because of State Department security concerns.
Violence by rebel groups has complicated efforts to battle what is now the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak. The CDC -- which is twice as large as the WHO -- has said its staff would return to the area once it is safe.
Mr. Tedros said the U.N. agency mostly needs the U.S. to continue the financial and other support it has provided. He noted the U.S. and many other countries have guidelines that prevent deployments in conflict zones like the eastern Congo

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Promises from nations around the world to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions fall far short of what is necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change, according to a new United Nations report that urges more-ambitious commitments to curb global warming.
The U.N. assessment, a progress report on climate-change mitigation, suggests current commitments put global temperatures on pace to rise 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. That is nearly double what many scientists say is the most the world can handle without destruction of entire ecosystems and a rise in sea levels that would flood many major cities and some entire countries.
For the report, the U.N. assembled a team of scientists to review the latest research on global-emissions trends and the effects of climate change. The team then compared that research with the national targets currently set by countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, which most scientists say cause climate change.
The report echoes findings of the U.S. government's National Climate Assessment, released Friday, which said that global warming is primarily caused by humans and that continuing efforts to counteract the effects of rising temperatures aren't enough, with potentially devastating economic consequences.
President Trump said Monday that he doesn't believe the predictions from the career scientists and academics contracted to work for his administration that global climate change could lead to hundreds of billions of dollars in annual economic losses.
Philip Drost, program officer at the U.N.'s environmental arm, criticized the countries that have been reluctant to move away from burning fuels like oil and coal, which add carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere. He said that is the biggest obstacle to the world's ability to meet its commitments to slow global warming.
"The missing link here is leadership," Mr. Drost said. "It's a matter of countries not yet wanting to take those bold steps. It is of course an incredibly difficult task to move from a fossil-fuel-based economy to a carbon-free economy."
The U.N. is beginning a year of negotiations tied to 2015's Paris climate accord. Next week, diplomats head to Poland to complete rules coming out of the agreement, and U.N. leaders will spend 2019 working through a process under the agreement that encourages countries to periodically update and potentially boost their commitments to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
While some parts of the Trump administration are still active in that process, Mr. Trump has positioned himself in opposition to it.
He announced last year his intent to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement, a stance he can officially request as early as November 2019 and potentially execute a year after.
The U.S. has become a world leader in reducing emissions in recent years as booming natural-gas production helped the U.S. move away from burning more carbon-rich coal for power.
Mr. Trump says China and other countries should do more to reduce their emissions. China has promised to do that, but only after allowing its emissions to keep rising for several more years. Like those of many developing countries that signed on to the Paris accord, China's commitments to cut emissions kick in years from now.
Global emissions show no signs of peaking at all, the U.N. says in the report. A peak before 2020 is crucial to meeting the targets of the Paris accord, but at this point it isn't likely even before 2030, the report says.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump said that he doesn't believe the central finding of a report released by his administration that global climate change could cause U.S. economic losses of hundreds of billions of dollars a year by the end of the century.
Speaking to reporters on Monday before leaving Washington for Mississippi, Mr. Trump said of the report, "I've seen it. I've read some of it. And it's fine."
Asked if he agreed with the assessment of a large economic impact, he responded: "I don't believe it."
The U.S. National Climate Assessment, released Friday, said the measures U.S. communities and companies are undertaking to try to counteract the effects of rising temperatures have so far fallen short.
The federal report concluded "that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being are rising."

Full text: LA CRETE, Alberta -- The farm belt is marching northward.
Upper Alberta is bitter cold much of the year, and remote. Not much grows other than the spruce and poplar that spread out a hundred miles around Highway 88 north toward La Crete. Signs warn drivers to watch for moose and make sure their gas tanks are filled. Farms have produced mostly wheat, canola and barley. Summers were so short farmer Dicky Driedger used to tease his wife about wasting garden space growing corn.
Today, Mr. Driedger is the one growing corn. So are many other northern-Alberta farmers who are plowing up forests to create fields, which lets them grow still more of it. The new prospect of warmer-weather crops is helping lift farmland prices, with an acre near La Crete selling for nearly five times what it fetched 10 years ago.
One reason is the warming planet and longer growing seasons. Temperatures around La Crete are 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer on average annually than in 1950, Canadian federal climate records show, and the growing season is nearly two weeks longer.
"A few degrees doesn't sound like much," said Mr. Driedger, 56, who has farmed for three decades in the area roughly as far north as Juneau, Alaska. "Maybe it doesn't make such a big difference on wheat or canola, but on corn, it sure does." In August, he watched a tractor-size tiller yank tree roots from the earth, which were to be piled up and ignited in giant bonfires to create new fields.
It is hard to predict precisely the effects of a changing planet, but the world of business and finance is trying to put prices on it. Agriculture is among industries on the front lines because a warming climate changes the crops that farmers can plant, affecting the productivity and value of their land.
Agricultural giants such as Bayer AG, Cargill Inc., DowDuPont Inc. and Bunge Ltd. are pushing to develop hardier crops, plan new logistics networks and offer new technologies designed to help farmers adapt. DowDuPont, maker of Pioneer brand seeds, said its scientists are developing crops that mature faster and in drier conditions for farmers in regions growing hotter. It is marketing weather services to help farmers better anticipate storms and weather-driven crop disease.
Along with water availability, "no challenge is more important to our industry -- and our world -- than climate change," said DowDuPont agriculture-business head James Collins in an October speech.
Warming temperatures are expanding regions suitable for wine grapes, according to a 2018 study in the journal Nature Climate Change. That may require vineyards in places like France to switch to more heat-tolerant varieties grown in Greece, said Elizabeth Wolkovich, a University of British Columbia associate professor who led the study.
Warming has helped increase U.S. corn harvests, delivering more than one-quarter of the yield growth across corn-belt states since 1981, according to a study published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Those gains may be harder to sustain as temperatures increase further, and climate shifts already are working against yields in some corn-producing regions, the report found. Overall, climate change-driven heat, droughts and soil erosion will likely diminish U.S. agricultural production, according to the latest installment of the U.S. National Climate Assessment, issued Friday.
Among the most striking effects on agriculture is the farm belt's shift northward. The leading edge is in Canada.
Higher temperatures are helping farmers transform prairie provinces, once home predominantly to wheat, as they dedicate more acres to corn and soybeans. Wheat still dominates, but its acreage hasn't grown over recent decades.
Canada's corn acreage, meanwhile, has climbed 20% over the past decade, while soybean acreage has roughly doubled, government data show. Before 2013, provinces such as Saskatchewan and Alberta grew no significant amounts of soybeans, according to Canadian government data. Now soybeans cover 425,000 acres in those provinces.
"I look for places that don't yet grow soybeans, that will eventually grow soybeans," said Joelle Faulkner, chief executive of Area One Farms, a Toronto investment firm that buys land in partnership with farmers.
On Area One land where farmers have planted soybeans, farmers' profitability has grown 30% over three to five years, boosting the land's value by roughly the same amount, she said. The spread of warmer-weather crops, she said, represents "the less negative effect of climate."
While U.S. corn-belt land prices stagnate, per-acre prices across Canada climbed 8.4% in 2017, according to Farm Credit Canada, an agricultural-lending firm, more than doubling over the past 10 years. In northern Alberta, farmland prices rose 11.5% last year to an average 2,030 Canadian dollars ($1,548) an acre.
That is still a long way from the average $7,326 for an acre of Iowa's rich, black soil, according to Iowa State University research in 2017. But it's catching up.
Near La Crete, a quarter-section, or 160 acres, of farmable land in 2017 sold for C$325,000 to C$350,000, up from C$65,000 to C$80,000 in 2008, the county assessor's data show. Local real-estate agent Eva Krahn-Richmond said she has seen sales this year of up to C$400,000.
Other factors, too, are making it easier to grow crops whose increased yields and often-higher market prices make land more valuable. In some areas, land prices are rising in part thanks to low interest rates and because some farming families are looking for additional land to support their children.
Canadian farmers differ on whether the rising temperatures noticeably affect their harvests year to year and on how much they can plan around the warmer summers.
D'Arcy Hilgartner is raising a small amount of corn and soybeans among his canola and wheat fields near Camrose, Alberta. He said temperatures may be increasing, but it is too subtle to make much of a difference on his farm. "I remember hot summers as a kid," he said.
But agricultural and weather researchers say warming is having a demonstrable effect on Canadian farming. "We're seeing crops grown in places they've never grown before," said Ian Jarvis, program director for the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring Initiative, an international project using satellites to track agricultural production.
Researchers at Alberta's University of Lethbridge in 2015 estimated the province's growing season had expanded by between two and five weeks a year, and that its average annual temperatures were two to 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit higher, than in 1950.
The area's potential to raise soybeans and corn are enticing investors such as Joshua Sawchuk, who oversees Canadian farmland investments as part of Manufacturers Life Insurance Co.'s $3 billion global portfolio of farm assets.
"When we're looking at investments we're always looking at crop rotations, and what the rotation's going to be in 10 years," Mr. Sawchuk said. He said he is looking for opportunities among the shifting crops and weather patterns of western Canadian provinces including Alberta.
With farmland prices rising, it makes sense to create more of it. House-size piles of branches and roots stretch away from northern Alberta's Highway 58. Orange signs along the road warn drivers of smoke.
Farmer Bill Boese in August stood on lumpy dirt that had once supported towering spruce and poplar trees. He said longer growing seasons help him raise better-yielding canola varieties, making each acre he clears potentially more profitable. He bought 1,200 acres three years ago in a private sale, and despite rising prices, he said demand remains robust among local families who want to let their children stay farming. "We're all tied back to the land."
Down the road in the 639-person hamlet of Fort Vermilion, Dr. Jacob Marfo counts each year's frost-free days. Dr. Marfo oversees the Mackenzie Applied Research Association, a farmer-managed nonprofit, where he raises test plots of corn, soybeans, canola and vegetables. In a decade, he said, higher temperatures and faster-maturing seeds will see corn replace oats on many of the area's fields.
As the region's narrow window to plant corn neared last spring, Ron Wieler's corn-planting machine -- one of just a few in the area -- was rapidly booked by corn-curious farmers. "I'm almost maxed out," said Mr. Wieler, who is also Pioneer's local seed salesman.
Seed and pesticide giant Bayer, which bought U.S. seed purveyor Monsanto this year, is breeding corn plants to be faster-maturing to produce crops in cooler climates. Those efforts help farmers in borderline areas take advantage of climatic shifts.
A decade ago, Monsanto's fastest-growing corn needed about 80 days to mature for harvesting, said Dan Wright, who oversees Bayer's Canadian corn and soybean research from Guelph, Ontario. Next year, he aims to begin selling corn that will mature in 70 days, targeting farmers in places like Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and Red Deer, Alberta. For corn and soybeans, the company's two biggest crops by sales, he said, such areas represent the "edge opportunity."
Canadian grain company Viterra Inc., owned by Glencore PLC, this fall is offering for the first time to buy soybeans at its Grimshaw, Alberta grain facility, a company official said. In Camrose, Alberta, a grain terminal owned by Cargill this year will buy soybeans from local farmers for the first time, the company said.
A Cargill spokeswoman said the company sees improved seeds driving much of Alberta's soybean expansion and is also evaluating the impact of a changing climate across dozens of business lines, which include transporting and processing farmers' crops around the world. "Today, the U.S. corn belt is in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana," Cargill CEO David MacLennan said in a 2016 interview. "In 50 years, it may be in Hudson Bay, Canada."
Bunge, a major U.S. agricultural trader and processor, incorporates climate analysis into its long-term strategy, including in its 2015 deal with the Saudi Agricultural & Livestock Investment Co. to invest $200 million in Canadian grain storage and transport assets. Those facilities buy corn and soybeans from Canadian farmers, along with wheat and other crops.
Australia's GrainCorp Ltd. and Japanese farm cooperative Zen-Noh Group in 2017 opened the first of four planned Canadian grain-shipping facilities capable of storing 35,000 metric tons of crops each. Warren Stow, the joint venture's president, said the companies anticipate improved seeds, better farming techniques and warming temperatures will boost Canada's crop production.
On Canada's rugged Pacific Coast, at the Port of Prince Rupert 40 miles south of Alaska's southern tip, trains pull grain-filled hopper cars through the Coast Mountains. They unload into waterfront storage bins at the remote port town of 11,733, raising dust as crops pour into vessels' cargo holds. Rain frequently drenches the peaks jutting up against the country's deepest ice-free seaport.
The ship-loading facility, benefiting from expanding harvests on Canada's western plains and regulatory changes to the way grain companies can ship crops, has nearly doubled its agricultural exports since 2008. The port, which channels farm goods to Asian markets, last year added capacity to handle more soybeans and lentils.
"It used to be viewed as an overflow port," said Nick Fox, president of Prince Rupert Grain Ltd., which operates the terminal. Canada's changing climate, in part, is boosting harvests and will likely push more crops toward the terminal, Mr. Fox said. Improvements the company is making to its terminal will allow it to handle corn and soybeans as farmers gravitate toward those crops, he said. The port's location, he said, is "very strategic."
Canadian farmers still worry about the weather, as farmers tend to. Southeast of Edmonton, Alberta, Jake Vermeer walks along a row of signs that mark a half-dozen corn varieties. It is the eighth year that Mr. Vermeer's family has been raising corn, test-growing varieties tailored to Canada's short growing season.
Mr. Vermeer's family manages 2,500 acres and a large dairy. An acre of corn can produce more than twice as much grain for Mr. Vermeer's cows than feed crops such as barley.
Since 1950, the growing season around Mr. Vermeer's farm has increased by 17 days, according to federal weather records. If climate change simply meant warmer temperatures, it would be a big boost to Canadian farmers, Mr. Vermeer said. But unusually long dry spells and harsher storms may also make farming more uncertain. "It's a tough one, because how do you predict it?"
Near La Crete, an early frost struck Mr. Driedger's cornfields in early September, cutting short its growth and diminishing this winter's feed supply for his cattle.
Mr. Driedger wasn't discouraged. He said he is considering buying his own corn planter, which would let him immediately put seeds in the ground when springtime conditions turn favorable, and capture more warm weather.
"The weather's tricky," he said, "just as tricky as ever."

Full text: The impact of global climate change is being felt across the country and, unchecked, could cause U.S. economic losses totaling hundreds of billions of dollars a year by the end of the century, says a U.S. government report released Friday.
Many U.S. communities and companies are trying to counteract the effects of rising temperatures ranging from water shortages or flooding to worsening wildfires and air pollution. But those measures so far fall short, according to the latest installment of the U.S. National Climate Assessment.
"Neither global efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being," the report said.
The federal report concludes "that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being are rising."
Mandated by law since 1990, the official climate assessment is produced every four years by the U.S. Global Change Research Program to guide federal policy makers. The new edition highlights the local impact of rising temperatures across the U.S.
"This report makes it clear that climate change is not some problem in the distant future. It's happening right now in every part of the country," said Brenda Ekwurzel, climate science director at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a report author. "When people say the wildfires, hurricanes and heat waves they're experiencing are unlike anything they've seen before, there's a reason for that, and it's called climate change."
The report's conclusions are at odds with statements by President Trump, who has been skeptical of global-warming trends, questioned the validity of climate science, and challenged federal regulations designed to control greenhouse-gas emissions.
"There has been no external interference in the development of this report," said David Easterling, director of the technical support unit at the National Centers for Environmental Information, who helped prepare the 1,500-page assessment.
More than 300 experts guided by a 60-member Federal Advisory Committee produced the report. It was then reviewed by federal agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. The report's authors also conducted regional workshops in over 40 cities.
All told, 17 of the 18 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000. Broadly, the warming trend has been driven in large part by land-use changes, including cutting down forests and paving over natural surfaces, and rising emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and methane from livestock production, scientists say.
In a separate federal report released Friday, researchers concluded that fossil-fuel emissions in North America have been declining steadily for the past decade, due to a reduced reliance on coal, greater use of natural gas, and increased vehicle fuel-efficiency standards.
As a result, North America's share of global carbon emissions dropped from 24% in 2004 to about 17% in 2013, said William Hohenstein, director of the Office of Energy and Environmental Policy at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Warming Is Blamed
For Shellfish Decline
Valuable species of shellfish have become harder to find on the East Coast because of degraded habitat caused by a warming environment, according to a pair of scientists that sought to find out whether environmental factors or overfishing was the source of the decline.
The scientists reached the conclusion in studying the decline in the harvest of four commercially important species of shellfish in coastal areas from Maine to North Carolina -- eastern oysters, northern quahogs, soft-shell clams and northern bay scallops. They reported that their findings came down squarely on the side of a warming ocean environment and a changing climate, and not excessive harvest by fishermen.
One of the ways warming has negatively impacted shellfish is by making them more susceptible to predators, said the lead author of the study, Clyde MacKenzie, a shellfish researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is based in Sandy Hook, N.J.
The findings have implications for consumers of shellfish, because a declining domestic harvest means the prices of shellfish such as oysters and clams could rise, or the U.S. could become more dependent on foreign sources.
The scientists observed that the harvest of eastern oysters from Connecticut to Virginia fell to less than 100,000 bushels in 2005 from around 600,000 in 1960. The harvest of the four species declined from 1980 to 2010 after enjoying years of stability from 1950 to 1980, they found.

YELLOWSTONE PARK
Wolves, Cougars Help
Restore Landscape
The return of wolves and cougars to Yellowstone National Park is helping restore a landscape that had been altered in their absence and allowing streams to return to a more natural state, a new study found.
The widespread extermination of wolves and cougars early last century meant elk herds that the carnivores prey on were able to grow in size. The swollen herds ate away willow plants and other vegetation along the park's streams, causing erosion damage.
But in recent years, resurgent populations of wolves and cougars have restored the park's natural balance by knocking back elk numbers and changing the herds' behaviors, according to Robert Beschta and William Ripple of the Oregon State University College of Forestry.
The findings were included in a peer-reviewed study published in the journal Ecohydrology.

Full text: Three-bedroom house. Ocean views. Steps from the water.
This was once a surefire home-sales pitch. Today, some buyers fear a warmer climate will bring fiercer floodwaters, winds and hurricanes -- and that has changed the math of waterfront real estate.
"I can't get anybody to come look at it," said real-estate agent Angela Payne, describing a four-bedroom home with river views near the coast in Somerset County, Md. She has been seeking a buyer for six months. The sellers reduced the price to $219,000 in October from $224,500.
"The area does have some flooding," she said of the property, which is in a federally designated flood zone, "so it's hard to get someone to invest that kind of money in a house when they see that."
The value of homes in Somerset County flood zones at a high risk of flooding had risen 10.5% from 2012 to 2017, while homes in the county not facing that risk rose 14.4%, an examination by The Wall Street Journal found.
The effects of the planet's slow heating are diffuse and its causes are debated. That hasn't stopped climate-change expectations filtering into business decisions and values of financial assets. In coastal residential real estate, those expectations are turning an old dictum on its head. "Location, location, location" is receding from the waterline.
Up and down the eastern seaboard, many home prices near water's edge aren't doing as well as homes inland in the same county, a Journal examination found. Real-estate brokers, homeowners and prospective buyers say a big reason is the perception that climate change is making such properties a riskier investment.
To compare changes in waterfront single-family home prices with those inland for the Journal examination, the real-estate information provider Realtor.com analyzed median prices per square foot in and out of designated high-risk flood zones in 16 coastal states between 2012 and 2017. A subsidiary of News Corp, the Journal's owner, operates Realtor.com.
In 40 of the 66 counties in the analysis, the prices of homes in high-risk flood zones failed to keep pace with those in areas not deemed at risk of flooding. In 2015, that phenomenon happened in 10 fewer counties.
"Buyers are more aware. Recent events are fresher in their minds," said Javier Vivas, senior analyst at Realtor.com, referring to hurricanes and large storms this year and last. "Because of that awareness they are more skeptical or at least more knowledgeable about this real, tangible risk."
Hurricane Florence in September inflicted an estimated $20 billion to $30 billion of damage from winds and flooding on residential and commercial properties across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, according to housing-data tracker CoreLogic Inc. Hurricane Michael a month ago caused $2.5 billion to $4 billion of damage in Florida, it said.
Waterfront property has traditionally commanded a premium. That is still the case, but the premium shrank to 36% in April 2018 nationwide from the two-decade average of 41%, according to real-estate-listings company Zillow.
The cost of staying is among deterrents to ownership. Lifting a house to protect against flooding can cost from $10,000 to upward of $100,000, depending on size, said Michael Brovont, sales manager at Wolfe House Movers in Bernville, Pa., which does such coastal raising work. That doesn't include the cost of permits, unhooking and re-establishing electricity and plumbing during the lift, or rebuilding the foundation, and of paying rent to live elsewhere during the process.
The estimated National Flood Insurance Program premium for $250,000 in building coverage for a primary residence in a high-risk flood zone is about $2,199, compared with an estimated $1,559 for a home in a low-risk zone, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In the highest-risk area that rises to an estimated $9,315.
The analysis for the Journal incorporated 1.2 million home sales in Realtor.com's data, using flood zones determined by FEMA to identify properties near water. The analysis excluded some states, such as Texas and Louisiana, where deed-level data aren't disclosed, and Western states such as California, where many coastal residences sit higher above water.
Alabama, Florida, North Carolina and Maryland now have more counties where high-risk flood-zone property is lagging than before, the analysis shows. The trend occurred in a limited number of areas in the West, including one county in Oregon and two in Hawaii.
Even where home buyers decide to be near water, "the desire to live three or four houses off the water versus right along the water has increased significantly" because of flooding concerns and rising flood-insurance costs, said Michael Hoffman, a real-estate agent at William Raveis Real Estate in Scituate, a town in Plymouth County, Mass.
In Florida, house prices in high-risk flood zones failed to keep pace with prices in low-risk zones in 20 counties around the state's long coastline. Hurricane Michael made landfall in October in Bay County, Fla., where single-family home prices in high-risk flood zones rose 23% between 2012 and 2017, while those outside such zones rose 32%. In neighboring Gulf County, high-risk flood-zone home prices rose 42% during that period while homes further inland rose 89%.
There are reasons beyond climate risk that some inland homes have appreciated more. Certain inland counties are home to fast-growing communities that have drawn more buyers. Municipal-finance problems in some states have led to higher taxes on the wealthy that have spurred affluent coastal dwellers to depart for lower-tax jurisdictions.
Some brokers and academics also contend that prices on the coast are already high, leading to lower percentage growth in median prices.
The Journal findings dovetail with recent research. A Harvard University study in May showed home prices at lower elevations are suffering, while once-modest neighborhoods on higher ground in Miami-Dade County, Fla., are appreciating more quickly, by virtue of their geography. University of Colorado researchers studying data from 2007 through 2016 found homes vulnerable to rising sea levels across the country are selling at a 7% discount to similar but less-exposed properties.
The pricing shift affects homeowners, insurance companies, lenders and the finances of towns and cities. Moody's Investors Service, which rates the creditworthiness of municipalities -- and thus how much they have to pay to borrow money -- warned in November 2017 that rising sea levels and more extreme weather could spur "steady migration that undermines local economies" and redistributes wealth, workers and demand for public services.
For the Journal examination, Realtor.com gathered single-family home sales data in more than 470 coastal counties on the East and West coasts and bordering the Great Lakes. It whittled that to the 66 coastal counties that met a number of flood-zone and deed-disclosure-related criteria.
Here's what life looks like, and how it has changed, in three states facing storm risks:
Connecticut
In Fairfield County, Conn., homes in areas with a high risk of flooding actually appreciated at a faster rate than those further inland between 2012 and 2017. But coastal properties that faced additional risk because of waves -- those right at the water's edge -- lost value. The median price per square foot of homes at the highest risk of flooding in the county declined 26.1% between 2012 and 2017, while it rose 3.2% for homes at a low risk of flooding.
Flood risks coupled with the state's deteriorating financial health have weighed on sales volumes this year, deterring potential buyers and making home sellers there "despondent" in recent years, said Peter Stuart, a real-estate agent there.
One of his customers who expected to sell a waterfront four-bedroom home for $2.5 million instead sold it for $2.2 million in the summer of 2017 despite investing heavily to renovate it and raise it up 10 feet. That client moved to a town further inland.
Florida
Florida is ground zero of coastal concerns. In Monroe County, home to Key Largo, the value of homes in high-risk flood zones rose 32% from 2012 to 2017; in low-risk zones, they rose 83%.
Yvette Toledo-Baste, a real-estate agent at Horizon Homes Realty in the Florida Keys, is closing on the sale of a four-bedroom Key Largo home for owners who want to move further inland in Miami. The home sold for $940,000, below the $1.125 million it was initially listed for more than a year ago.
Lindsay Carriera, her boyfriend, Josh Paul Dykstra, and his 12-year-old son moved from Sussex County, N.J., to Florida for a better quality of life in August 2017, just before Hurricane Irma hit and they were forced to evacuate.
"Knowing that we could potentially come home to nothing was very upsetting," Ms. Carriera said. The couple looked at more than a dozen coastal homes, but Mr. Dykstra ultimately bought a three-bedroom home further inland in Charlotte County.
"It kills us not to be able to walk out back and see water," said Ms. Carriera, 27, but "you would be spending more money to upkeep it than actually enjoying it and that's why we went inland. I guess it's just peace of mind." Mr. Dykstra bought a the newly constructed home for about $240,000 and the pair plan to move in November. The value of Charlotte County single-family homes in high-risk flood zones rose 59.2% between 2012 and 2017, compared with a 76.5% increase in the value homes further inland.
New Jersey
In Ocean County, N.J., a middle-class, coastal county home to multilevel beachfront houses and small summer bungalows, the value of high-risk flood-zone homes rose 1% between 2012 and the end of last year. The value of inland homes rose 26%.
The scale of that difference was a surprise even to Annmarie Uhl, who knows well the potential costs of repairing and retrofitting a home on the coast.
She and her husband saved for 20 years and by 2008 had enough for a down payment on an $820,000 four-bedroom cape in Beach Haven. Its prior owner had lifted the home 4 feet off the ground.
Four years later, Hurricane Sandy's rising tides flooded their house beyond repair. The couple received nearly $35,000 in insurance money, but they couldn't fully repair their home's electrical and plumbing systems.
The year after Sandy, they spent $10,000 on new plumbing and electric systems and $3,000 on landscaping to keep water at bay. The next year, the home's pipes damaged by the storm, burst and cost another $20,000 to repair. That year, the couple discovered mold had grown in their kitchen, requiring them to rip out the cabinetry, a $25,000 expense. Then their electric system broke again. "We could never restore the house to where it was pre-Sandy," Ms. Uhl said.
They weighed rebuilding against selling at a loss and ultimately decided to tear down the old home and build a new one. It cost $500,000. This time they have forgone costly flood insurance. "We're 10 feet off the ground. If we get that much water and it floods our house we're done and flood insurance is not going to cover it," Ms. Uhl said.
Like the Uhls, Phyllis Sardoni, still a schoolteacher at 83, is holding out. She raised her two-bedroom home near the Jersey Shore 12 feet after Hurricane Sandy and plans to remain there indefinitely. She climbs the 12 steps it now takes to reach her front door, tends to her garden where wildflower seeds carried in by Sandy bloom, and regularly moves her car in anticipation of high tides. "I have the beach house, which is what I've always wanted," she said. "It's everything it should be."

Full text: Your editorial "Washington's Carbon Tax: Take Two" (Oct. 22) points out that some emissions sources are exempted by Washington's carbon-fee ballot initiative and asks: For those worried about climate change, why tolerate exceptions?
Energy intensive and trade-exposed businesses were excluded because they might have fled the state and brought their emissions elsewhere. Imposing the carbon fee on the state's coal plant that is shutting down by 2025 would have violated a previous commitment to the owners of the plant, its workers and the surrounding community. Finally, for dispersed sources of emissions, such as emissions from agricultural lands, a carbon fee isn't the right policy tool because monitoring and enforcement would be overly burdensome.
It is correct that like any other serious policy that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions, a carbon tax would raise energy costs and, by itself, have only minimal effect on global emissions. But state-level policy can spur action in other states and at the federal level and thus lead to larger emissions reductions. Economists have long supported carbon taxes as the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions.
When they vote on Initiative 1631, the real question in front of Washington voters is whether to do something, or nothing, about the risks of climate change.

If liberals don't accept a revenue-neutral fossil-carbon fee and dividend plan, the hope to avoid catastrophic climate change will diminish.
Conservatives, however, should also accept a revenue-neutral approach. Your statement, "businesses said it would destroy jobs and increase energy prices, which is true," disagrees with the results of a detailed study that showed that jobs and GDP would increase with a fee and dividend. This occurs because the poor spend their dividend, and the rich, who pay more in fees, don't change their spending much. The study can be found on the website for the Citizen's Climate Lobby.

Your editorial correctly points out that liberals are wrong to push for a carbon tax to increase government spending. That would harm the economy. However, if carbon-tax revenue was instead used to make President Trump's tax cuts permanent or reduce other harmful taxes, it would help expand the economy -- especially if the carbon taxes replaced the costly regulatory regime currently in place.
According to a new EY analysis, a regulatory approach to reduce carbon pollution would reduce gross domestic product in the long run by an average of $1,770 per household annually. However, the report shows that accomplishing the same reductions in carbon pollution through a revenue-neutral carbon tax would increase GDP in the long-run by an average of $5,090 per household every year.
Without additional government spending in the mix, a revenue-neutral carbon tax is an efficient, conservative solution that can be coupled with a roll back in regulations and offsetting tax cuts to boost the economy, protect the environment and spur innovation.

Full text: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and her Republican challenger Chele Farley clashed Thursday over immigration, health care and climate change during the only scheduled debate of their campaign.
Ms. Farley, a private-equity executive making her first run for office, repeatedly questioned whether Ms. Gillibrand's focus was on her constituents in the Empire State or on a possible presidential run in 2020. Ms. Gillibrand answered that if re-elected, "I will serve my six-year term."
The debate moderator, WABC-TV host Bill Ritter, noted that Ms. Gillibrand hasn't spent much campaign cash on her re-election effort. Ms. Gillibrand said she had visited all 62 of New York's counties and was regularly holding town hall meetings. Ms. Farley was unconvinced.
"Honestly, I don't believe that," she said. "She's been in five other states, including New Hampshire, this month."
The debate was a chance for Ms. Farley -- who trails in the most recent poll by 25 points and has a 10th of the campaign cash on hand as the incumbent -- to make her case before a large audience. The women initially were set to debate Sunday evening on a forum televised by Spectrum News, but Ms. Gillibrand canceled because of a continuing labor dispute involving Spectrum's parent company, Charter Communications.
Their 30-minute exchange was cordial, as both women outlined competing proposals on various subjects. Ms. Gillibrand said she favors a "Medicare for All" plan that would guarantee people have "access to lifesaving care." Ms. Farley questioned the cost of such a measure, and said a single-payer health-insurance system might lead to long waits for specialists or surgical procedures.
A Quinnipiac University Poll showed a majority of New Yorkers disapprove of the way Republican President Trump does his job, and Ms. Gillibrand repeatedly tried to tie him to Ms. Farley. Mr. Trump endorsed Ms. Farley during a fundraiser in Utica, N.Y., in August.
Ms. Gillibrand invoked Mr. Trump in questions about climate change, immigration, political civility, taxes, and the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. (Ms. Gillibrand voted against him; Ms. Farley said she would have voted to confirm.)
Ms. Gillibrand said she would support "putting a price on carbon" and establishing a carbon exchange in the U.S. Ms. Farley said the country already is reducing emissions and more focus should be placed on polluters in India and China.
"We know the climate is changing, but we've got to balance it out with economic interests and keep America's interests at heart," Ms. Farley said.
"That's why New York needs a senator who will stand up to President Trump," Ms. Gillibrand said.
The debate was recorded Thursday, and will be aired at 11 a.m. on Sunday on WABC's "Up Close with Bill Ritter."

Full text: The state of New York sued Exxon Mobil Corp. on Wednesday, accusing the oil giant of misleading investors about the risks that climate-change regulations pose to its business.
The lawsuit, filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, said that for years Exxon told its investors that it adequately accounted for greenhouse-gas regulations by applying a so-called proxy cost -- an estimate of the effects of future events such as climate regulations -- to its business planning and investment decisions. In reality, Exxon applied either a lower proxy cost or no cost at all, the lawsuit claims.
"Exxon built a facade to deceive investors into believing that the company was managing the risks of climate-change regulation to its business when, in fact, it was intentionally and systematically underestimating or ignoring them, contrary to its public representations," New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement.
"The company looks forward to refuting these claims as soon as possible and getting this meritless civil lawsuit dismissed," Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said in a statement.
In 2015, the New York attorney general's office began an investigation into the matter, for which Exxon produced more than three million pages of documents. The Securities and Exchange Commission also looked into whether the oil giant misled investors about its accounting practices and climate-change risks, but ended the probe earlier this year without penalizing the company.
The New York suit alleges Exxon executives, including former chairman and chief executive Rex Tillerson, knew for years that the company was using a second set of proxy costs, from undisclosed internal guidance, that were lower than the ones publicly disclosed.
Mr. Tillerson couldn't be reached for comment.
The attorney general's office is requesting damages to correct what the lawsuit says are inaccurate past representations and to change its practices going forward.
"Through its fraudulent scheme, Exxon in effect erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate-change regulation and had factored those risks into its business operations," the lawsuit said.
In one instance, the suit claims, Exxon failed to apply appropriate proxy costs to oil-sands projects in Canada, which led to the company understating the projects' long-term impact to its cash-flow forecasts by more than $25 billion.
"These baseless allegations are a product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing," Mr. Silvestri said.

But in his second suggestion to cut methane emissions, the only specific step he mentions is the Environmental Defense Fund's future launch of a satellite. He lays out "our goal" of a 45% reduction in methane pollution within seven years -- a pretty ambitious target.
In his suggestion for taxes on carbon, Mr. Krupp mentions William Nordhaus's work on pricing carbon as "much cheaper . . . than command-and-control regulations," yet in the prior sentence he couldn't help but admit that any such policy "must include enforceable limits to ensure emissions are cut as much as the science demands." When I studied economics, relying on markets to set prices and volume didn't include strict government limits on production based on what "science" rather than the market itself dictated.
Mr. Krupp undoubtedly means well, but his pie-in-the-sky thinking is untethered to basic economics or what Americans and others in the world are willing to tolerate for slight reductions in global temperatures.

I was hoping to see a suggestion that truly allows the market to address climate change by eliminating a government action that exacerbates the impact of rising atmospheric temperatures: End flood insurance subsidies for coastal homes and businesses. Not only would this policy lessen the financial and human damage of any rising sea levels and storm intensity, it would lower the income redistribution from poorer to richer by eliminating a major subsidy for those who can afford an ocean view.

Regarding Fred Krupp's call: That's what we're doing in New York State. Markets have more money, move faster and bring more innovation than government. Outdated government policy has protected regulated utilities from the forces of global competition that have shaped other capital-intensive industries. Thanks to adoption of new technology, business models and financial incentives, other capital-intensive industries have average capacity utilization approaching 90%. The utility industry manages 54%. Capturing this difference is a prize to the private sector worth billions a year in New York state alone. As we have changed our policies to be more market based, New York's clean-energy jobs are one of the fastest-growing sectors of the state -- we added an additional 5,600 new clean-energy jobs across the state in 2017.
While Justice Louis Brandeis said that states are "laboratories of democracy," they can be laboratories of markets, too. If we don't start giving markets a chance, then command and control will be coming. Governments won't be able to do anything when droughts, sea-level rise, food shortages and our infrastructure face imminent threat.

Full text: Brewers including Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, Molson Coors Brewing Co. and Carlsberg A/S are taking steps to maintain supplies of barley, the main crop used in beer, amid climate change. A new study suggests their preparations might not be enough.
The researchers say the study is the first quantifying how barley production could be affected by heat waves and droughts, a subject of intense interest -- and uncertainty -- among beer makers.
The authors found barley yields could fall 3% to 17% across the globe by the end of the century, depending on the severity of climate change.
Most barley is used for animal feed, with only about 17% of the crop used for brewing. That means falling yields could have a disproportionate impact on beer production, making a cold beer costlier and harder to come by, the researchers said in the study, published Monday in the journal Nature Plants.
"We made the assumption that farmers may be able to adapt to gradual changes, but it may be harder to adapt to more extreme events," said Steven Davis, the study's senior author, who studies the environmental impacts of trade at the University of California, Irvine. To model such extreme events, the researchers identified droughts and heat waves that might occur simultaneously during growing seasons.
The study comes at a time of upheaval for the beer industry, which generated $111 billion in sales in the U.S. alone last year. Fewer Americans are drinking beer, while thousands of U.S. breweries have opened in the past decade, putting pressure on big beer makers.
To increase barley's resilience, farmers have been tinkering with the crop for thousands of years, genetic analysis of seeds has shown. Farmers and brewers in recent years have been trying to develop hardier forms.
"We have seen there are changes that are already happening," said Jess Newman, director of U.S. agronomy at AB InBev, which is testing new barley strains and monitoring crop conditions among its 4,500 growers.
Some industry officials say such efforts should prove sufficient to protect the crop. "We don't see an impending calamity with beer," said Chris Swersey, supply-chain specialist at the Brewers Association, which represents about 4,500 small craft breweries.
In the new study, the researchers built five models of climate change, from least severe to most severe.
In the best-case scenario, crop yields actually rose as much as 90% in certain areas, including regions of China and the U.S., but those increases weren't enough to offset poor harvests world-wide.
In the worst case, global barley crops dried up, beer prices doubled on average, and beer drinking generally dropped. The volume of beer quaffed in China, the world's biggest consumer of beer, could fall by 10%, while dropping in the U.S. by as much as 20%, the researchers said.

Full text: Exxon Mobil Corp., once a powerful skeptic of global warming, will now be among the first oil companies to put money into the fight to make climate change a political priority in Washington.
The U.S.'s largest energy producer will commit $1 million over two years to promote a national tax on carbon as a way to address the environmental issue. The funding will back an initiative designed to appeal to the Republicans who now control Washington, and may open the door for Exxon's peers in the oil industry to follow.
As warnings over the dangers of climate change have grown, governments around the world have pursued increasingly stringent regulation of fossil-fuel companies. Exxon's move is an attempt to manage such pressure in the U.S. in ways it hopes will simplify requirements on the oil industry, according to a person familiar with the company's thinking.
Exxon sees a carbon tax as an alternative to patchwork regulations, putting one cost on all carbon emitters nationwide and eliminating regulatory uncertainty hovering over Exxon's business in states that might seek to target oil companies, the person said.
Exxon's contribution will go to Americans for Carbon Dividends, a new group, one of whose co-chairmen is former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. It is promoting a carbon tax-plus-dividend policy first proposed by two former U.S. secretaries of state, James Baker III and George Shultz, last year. All three men are Republicans.
The initiative's goal is to discourage companies from emitting carbon through the tax, while minimizing additional cost to consumers. Funds raised by the tax would be channeled to Americans through what the group calls a "carbon dividend" that it estimates could be as much as $2,000 annually per family. Monthly payments would go directly to the recipients.
Exxon's move places it among global corporations that are promoting policies and business strategies to fight climate change. That list includes Apple Inc., Nike Inc. and McDonald's Corp., all of which have pledged to embrace renewable power and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.
General Motors Co., Johnson & Johnson, and other oil companies, including BP PLC, are founding members of the Climate Leadership Council, the organization fine-tuning the Baker-Shultz plan. "This is a real turning point in U.S. climate policy and politics," the council's leader, Ted Halstead, said of Exxon's commitment. "Corporations are leading us to a solution."
Exxon has countered the accusation that it sowed doubt on climate change, emphasizing its contribution to more than 100 peer-reviewed research papers on the issue. Also, it has pushed to make environmentalism part of its brand. For example, this year it pledged to cut its methane emissions 15% by 2020.
Its support for a carbon tax puts Exxon in rare opposition to allies in the Republican Party. Republican leaders have often derided the idea of global warming and disdained taxes as a solution.
Exxon's promotion of a carbon tax marks "an interesting and important signal shift," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.). "For years, Exxon's political effort was all on the side of climate denial and obstruction," he said. "At least Exxon money is now on both sides of the fight."
---
Stance Evolves
On Climate Change
Exxon's decision to lobby for a carbon tax represents a remarkable shift from the company's stance roughly two decades ago. At the time, Exxon was at the center of industry efforts questioning the validity of global-warming claims and policy proposals -- tactics that critics say contributed to the political polarization that has impeded legislative consensus on the issue to this day.
As early as 1997, Exxon took out newspaper advertisements, titled "Unsettled Science," that asserted "scientists remain unable to confirm" whether humans are causing "global warming." That same year, in a speech just months before a multination agreement to reduce emissions was reached in Kyoto, Japan, Lee Raymond, then Exxon's CEO, said proposals to cut emissions "are neither prudent nor practical."
In the ensuing years, Exxon and some peers spent tens of millions of dollars supporting such bodies as the Global Climate Coalition, the American Petroleum Institute and the American Legislative Exchange Council, all of which highlighted scientific uncertainty about rising global temperatures. As it did, Exxon also supported climate research, including a $100 million contribution to Stanford University to promote climate science and emissions reduction.
By all accounts, the company's stance softened after Rex Tillerson took over from Mr. Raymond in 2006. Exxon executives began affirming climate change in public statements, saying the problem "warrants action." The company also began supporting the idea of a "revenue-neutral carbon tax."
That change coincided with investor pressure to disclose the impact of climate regulations on its business -- and accusations from environmental advocates that while Exxon recognized the dangers of rising temperatures, it ignored the issue or even sowed doubt on the science. Exxon's support for a carbon tax stems in part from a desire to alleviate some of these pressures.

Full text: The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded Monday to Americans William D. Nordhaus and Paul M. Romer, two top economists of their generation, for work on climate change and innovation.
The pair of economics professors, Dr. Nordhaus of Yale University and Dr. Romer of New York University, have "significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature and knowledge," the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in granting them the prize.
Dr. Nordhaus built models to measure the impacts of climate change on the economy and the costs of addressing it. Dr. Romer examined how ideas and knowledge fuel economic growth, and how to foster environments in which knowledge and growth can flourish.
Although their work took them down different paths, they had in common a view that government and public policy had a role to play in fostering prosperity in the long run. In the process, their work pushed back against free-market thinkers in academia who see a hands-off role for government.
Dr. Romer, a former chief economist at the World Bank, laid the foundation for so-called endogenous growth theory, which underscores the importance of policies that promote research, development and access to better education for driving technological innovation and, consequently, growth. Before his work in the early 1990s, economists had accepted that technology was a key driver of growth, but didn't believe that much could be done to accelerate the pace of innovation.
"The question that I first asked was, why was progress -- measured in, say, the rate of growth of GDP, but measured in lots of other ways -- why was progress speeding up over time?" Dr. Romer said. "It arises because of this special characteristic of an idea, which is if you've got, like, a million people trying to discover something, if any one person finds it, everybody can use the idea."
Dr. Nordhaus's work began in the 1970s when scientists were growing concerned about global warming. His methods, now called integrated assessment models, have become widely used to examine the consequences of different policy interventions targeting climate change, the Nobel committee said.
Each laureate advocates for public policies to overcome a "market failure," the Nobel committee said. Dr. Romer's work recommends government support for knowledge creation, while Dr. Nordhaus argues for the implementation of global carbon taxes to reduce long-term greenhouse-gas emissions.
"There are billions of individuals, millions of firms, thousands of governments, hundreds of nations, and for them to take action, they're going to have to have incentives," Dr. Nordhaus said in a news conference. "We can raise the prices of goods and services that are carbon intensive and lower the ones that are less carbon intensive."
Dr. Romer said his work on the compounding effects of technological change suggests that the solutions proposed by Dr. Nordhaus will be effective.
"I think people are grossly underestimating how rapidly we'll start to decarbonize once we put our minds to it," he said. "But the problem is, it's going to take the government to create the incentives and the framework to get that to happen. We need governments to step up and seize this as an opportunity."
Dr. Romer, 62 years old, the son of former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago, where he completed his doctorate in economics in 1983. More recently, he served as chief economist of the World Bank.
Dr. Nordhaus, 77, was born in Albuquerque, N.M. He graduated from Yale in 1963 and received his Ph.D. in economics in 1967 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
At his news conference, which at his request was held only after he had finished teaching a class on intermediate macroeconomics, colleagues at Yale lauded his commitment to teaching.

Full text: Rapid, far-reaching changes to almost every facet of society are needed to avoid catastrophic climate change, reforms far beyond anything governments are either doing or planning to do, according to a report from a United Nations-led scientific panel.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made the pronouncement as part of its assessment of climate change and efforts to mitigate its impact. The study came as a response to the more than 190 signatory nations to the 2015 Paris climate accord. The Trump administration announced last year its intent to pull out of the accord.
A failure by countries to meet voluntary targets to limit global warming to "well below" two degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, would be devastating for some ecosystems and raise sea levels to flood many major cities and some entire countries, among other risks, the report says.
The IPCC's process brings together several scientists as lead authors to assess the scientific, technical and economic data available on whatever climate-change-related topic they're covering. Some of that is peer-reviewed research, but the work also includes some non-peer-reviewed work by governments and industry.
Typically, hundreds of scientists review the drafts IPCC authors put together, and government negotiators also have a say in their conclusions, a practice that has drawn criticism from scientists in the past. While a large body of scientific work concludes emissions cause global warming, some dispute those conclusions.
The IPCC report finds meeting the carbon-reduction goals would require dramatic changes in how citizens get energy, how industries make everyday products, and how cities are designed.
To meet the goals of the Paris agreement and reduce other risks, 2010 levels of global carbon dioxide emissions would need to be halved by 2030, and effectively end by around 2050, the IPCC report says. Global emissions are not shrinking, and rose last year to record levels after several years of remaining flat -- despite emissions cuts in the U.S., U.K. and some other countries, according to the International Energy Agency.
The IPCC was the subject of controversy in a 2009 dispute, after the release of hacked emails led to questions over its methodology. A series of independent investigations, following the hack, allowed the institution to claim vindication.

Full text: When a wildfire engulfed the Canadian oil-sands boomtown of Fort McMurray two years ago, it hit insurance company Aviva PLC out of nowhere.
The British firm had been active in Canada since 1835. Its actuaries long believed wildfire risk to homes in the area was almost nonexistent, it says. Yet flames on the town's outskirts roared across an area larger than Delaware, forcing 100,000 people to evacuate and leaving insurers with $3 billion in damages to cover.
"That is not a type of loss we have experienced in that part of the world, ever," says Maurice Tulloch, the Toronto-based chief executive of Aviva's international insurance division. "The previous models wouldn't have envisioned it."
Aviva studied the incident and concluded the wildfire was an example of how the earth's gradually warming temperature is changing the behavior of natural catastrophes. Aviva increased premiums in Canada as a result.
The effects of the planet's slow heating are diffuse. Predictions of the fallout are imprecise, and the drivers are debated. But faced with the prospect of a warming planet, the world of business and finance is starting to put a price on climate change.
The price of homes on the U.S.'s eastern seaboard battered by fiercer storms and higher seas is lagging behind those inland. The price of farmland is rising in North America's once-frigid reaches, partly because of bets it will become more temperate. Investors are turning fresh water into an asset, a wager in part that climate change will make it scarcer.
Insurers are at the forefront of calculating the impact. "We don't discuss the question anymore of, 'Is there climate change,' " says Torsten Jeworrek, chief executive for reinsurance at Munich Re, the world's largest seller of reinsurance -- insurance for insurers. "For us, it's a question now for our own underwriting."
For the most part, insurers are acting on climate change by building models that aim to better estimate the impact. That leaves the industry with the tough question of how to reflect in premiums the new understandings of the underlying risk.
"It takes a lot of premium, a lot of margin, to account for this increased uncertainty, and I'm not sure we're doing a good job of reflecting this and charging appropriately for it," said Marc Grandisson, chief executive of insurer Arch Capital Group Ltd., at an industry conference Thursday. "We need to incorporate a greater range of possible outcomes into our pricing."
Arch has written less property-catastrophe reinsurance in recent years as prices have dropped and as industry results have been volatile, in part due to losses attributed to climate change, Arch spokesman Donald Watson says.
After the Canadian wildfire, Aviva's changes to its risk models filtered into its home-insurance premiums in Canada, which increased by roughly 6% since 2016, partly because of its research into catastrophe risks.
For most insurers, rates aren't rising -- yet. A flood of capital into the industry from pension and hedge-fund investors, driven by low interest rates, has increased competition and pushed down property-catastrophe reinsurance prices in the past decade.
And property insurance and reinsurance contracts typically last one year, so an insurer can recalibrate yearly as risks change. "Global warming may be occurring. Probably is," says Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which has a major reinsurance business. "But it hasn't hurt the reinsurance industry. And people are pricing still as if it won't, on a one-year basis."
If reinsurance contracts covered 30 years, he says, "I'd be crazy not to" include the risks.
Understanding how weather is changing is laborious and plagued by the same uncertainty that prevents weekly forecasts from being precise. The genesis of a major hurricane, say, depends on factors such as wind shear -- the wind pattern that gives hurricanes a whirling shape -- not just the warming surface temperature that fuels it. One changing factor may make a storm more likely to be dangerous, but another could shift it on a path away from land or cities.
Big insurers are expanding teams of in-house climatologists, computer scientists and statisticians to redesign models to incorporate the effect of the warming earth on hailstorms, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. Insurers such as Swiss Re Group say hurricanes like Harvey and Florence, which caused widespread flooding, could represent a more common occurrence in the coming decades.
Climate change may be gradual, but the effects are volatile, meaning a company could become exposed to a large, unexpected hit if it doesn't understand the changing risks, says Junaid Seria, head of catastrophe-model research and development and governance at Paris-based reinsurer Scor SE.
"We're in the camp that believes you can have an increased potential for an outsized loss in a single year," he says. "There's a cost for inaction."
The industry has historically changed after big disasters. Natural-catastrophe modeling took off after Hurricane Andrew struck Florida on Aug. 24, 1992, causing an estimated $15.5 billion of insured losses. Thirteen insurance companies were ordered liquidated, according to ratings firm A.M. Best Co.
Catastrophe models -- computer algorithms that analyze disasters and property data to predict losses -- grew more sophisticated over time. Their secret sauce was building databases of weather events going back decades.
Climate change upends that strategy because scientists broadly believe the future is likely to be very different from the prior decades that are the basis for these models. The climate has grown about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit warmer since the late 19th century. A consensus of scientists puts blame substantially on emissions of greenhouse gases from cars, farms and factories.
The team of 35 scientists and engineers at Swiss Re who test and update its internal catastrophe models found that the decades of torrential rainfall that had long been a part of the model were no longer useful for predicting risks in some regions, because rain now falls so much more heavily and frequently there. They now use just the past 25 years, Swiss Re says.
Using a shorter observation period has shown a higher rate of torrential downpours resulting in property damage in many parts of the world. That has made rainfall a higher-priority peril for Swiss Re, the company says.
AIR Worldwide, a unit of Verisk Analytics Inc. that sells catastrophe models to insurers, since about 2010 has limited many of its models to the most recent 30 to 35 years of data, says director of meteorology Peter Sousounis. It previously used data going back to as early as 1951. For capturing both longer-term and shorter-term trends, he says, "we feel that that's a good compromise."
There has been an acceleration of studies over recent years by university and government researchers using statistical techniques -- broadly called attribution science -- that show the correlation between the changing climate and the characteristics of individual weather events. They use the same techniques to show the burning of fossil fuels can be a driver of those results.
Insurers such as Munich Re are analyzing those studies and conducting research to focus on the potential for increased losses to the insurer that could reduce its profits. "We can only accept risk and put risks on our books if we understand them properly," says Ernst Rauch, Munich Re's global head of climate and public-sector business development. That, he says, is "why we are so interested in climate change."
Munich Re researchers found a significant increase in storms with hailstones larger than a penny in diameter between 1979 and 2016 in central and southern Europe, causing higher losses during that period. Munich Re concluded such storms will get worse, something previous models didn't show. "We believe there is a strong indication that climate change is a driver of this trend," Mr. Rauch says. Those conclusions, he says, led Munich Re to order a redesign of the risk model for hailstorm-insurance losses that helps set the price of its premiums. "This might entail many things," he says, "in some regions also an adjustment in price."
A 2015 study from professors at Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found the warming planet is increasing the chance a major hurricane could enter the Persian Gulf, home to hundreds of billions of dollars of petroleum equipment and assets.
Such cyclones periodically hit Oman and Yemen but have never been observed in the Persian Gulf, climate researchers say. The researchers found that, with new conditions due to warming, some cyclones could enter the Gulf in the future and could also form in the Gulf itself.
"Climate change makes the historical record of extreme weather an unreliable indicator of the current risk," says Stephen Pacala, a board member at Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd. and a Princeton professor, who wasn't involved in the study. "So, what's the insurance industry to do? No hurricane has ever threatened the massive unarmored oil and gas infrastructure in the Persian Gulf."
Markus Stowasser, head of catastrophe research and development at Allianz SE's reinsurance unit, says computer simulations show an increase in the probability of "extreme gray swan events," expected but rare phenomena such as hurricanes, forming in the Persian Gulf. ("Black swan" events are both unexpected and rare.) The simulations show such events still don't seem likely near-term.
Insurers' most immediate climate peril is water. More heat means more moisture held in the atmosphere and greater precipitation. Melting ice is pushing up sea levels. A 2013 study in the journal Nature projected average flood losses for the world's 136 biggest coastal cities could rise from $6 billion a year in 2005 to $52 billion a year by 2050 due to increased population and development. When taking climate change and a sea-level rise into account, flood losses could exceed $1 trillion a year by 2050, the study concluded, unless the cities invested about $50 billion annually in adapting.
Hurricanes historically caused wind damage. But Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in August 2017, spent weeks absorbing 33 trillion gallons of water, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It dumped more than 60 inches of rain and caused tens of billions of dollars in flood damage.
The probability of a Texas storm dropping about 20 inches of rain was about 1% a year between 1981 and 2000, but will likely increase to 18% a year by 2100, according to a 2017 study by Kerry Emanuel, an MIT professor of atmospheric science who says changing climate conditions are driving the trend.
"As the atmosphere warms, we see great rainfall rates," says Marla Schwartz, atmospheric-perils specialist at Swiss Re. Referring to Harvey, she says: "We might expect to see something more often like that in the future."
Hurricane Florence, which hit North Carolina last month, behaved similarly to Harvey and dropped more than 30 inches of rain on parts of the state.
Increased flood damage also presents an opportunity to insurers. As more regions become exposed to flooding, insurers expect the market for flood insurance to grow. Much of Harvey's flood damage wasn't covered, insurers say, because the industry has historically excluded floods from residential policies. "What we call the protection gap is still huge," says Edouard Schmid, group chief underwriting officer at Swiss Re. "We of course want to offer solutions around risks, including climate risks."
Changing risk probabilities may make some areas uninsurable altogether, or at least so risky the cost would be prohibitively expensive for insurance buyers, executives say.
Allianz, one of the world's largest insurers, says it sold the retail business of U.S. insurer Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. in 2015 in part because climate change is increasing the risk of losses to coastal homes in California and Florida.
"Coastal flooding will clearly become a bigger issue in the long term," Swiss Re's Mr. Schmid says. "We can offer protection for hurricane losses or flood losses or other perils, but if certain coastal areas are so exposed, insurance becomes no longer viable. It becomes even uninsurable."

Full text: A coalition of the world's biggest oil companies promised Monday to reduce methane emissions from natural gas extraction -- part of an effort to shore up the climate credentials of the hydrocarbon.
The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, an industry group that counts oil giants like Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Saudi Arabia's state oil giant, Aramco, among its members, said it would target reducing methane emissions to less than 0.25% of the total natural gas the group of 13 member companies produces by 2025.
Methane is the main component of natural gas, but it also often leaks into the environment during production, transportation and processing. Even though it stays in the atmosphere for less time than carbon dioxide, methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas in the short term because it traps more heat. According to the International Energy Agency, one ton of methane is equivalent to as much as 87 tons of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame.
Natural gas production is growing and many big oil companies have held the fuel up as a climate-friendly alternative to coal that can help make the oil-and-gas sector more resilient in efforts to limit climate change.
A number of big companies including Exxon, Shell and BP PLC have already disclosed their own goals for reducing methane emissions. Shell, in particular, has tilted its production mix toward more gas output.
"If you're the size we are in the global gas market, one of the key things is to grow the role of gas in the energy sector," said Shell's head of gas Maarten Wetselaar. "If it is to take its rightful place in the energy mix, we need to make sure methane is not something that holds it back."
There is also a strong business case: At the moment, many big companies don't have an accurate measure of the amount of gas they lose through leaks. By preventing those leaks, companies don't leave money from lost gas sales on the table.
According to an April report by the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, as much as $34 billion of global gas supply is lost each year through leaks and venting.
Last week, Shell said it would limit methane emissions from projects it operates to less than 0.2% of the total natural gas extracted by 2025. BP has set a goal to limit its so-called methane-emission intensity to 0.2% by the middle of the next decade, while Exxon said in May that it would cut methane emissions 15% by 2020.

Full text: Global mining companies that bet on coal are enjoying the best prices in years -- a sign there is money to be made from the industry even as an energy transition to gas and renewables takes place.
Glencore PLC has used rising sentiment against coal to expand its position in the market, scooping up unwanted assets. The Swiss mining and trading giant has a history of pushing into businesses where rivals are reluctant to tread.
So far, Glencore's gamble appears to be paying off. High demand from Asia helped thermal coal prices delivered from Newcastle, Australia, the world's largest coal-export port, more than double since they bottomed in early 2016 to about $110 a metric ton. Export prices from South Africa and import prices into Europe are also at or near their highest levels in years.
Glencore stock has struggled this year amid regulatory scrutiny linked to businesses in Africa and Venezuela. But its coal division was a big driver in the record earnings it recorded in the first half of 2018, generating more than a quarter of its $8.3 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Even after recent weakness, Glencore shares have more than quadrupled since the 2016 low in coal prices. Shares of global mining firms Rio Tinto PLC and BHP Billiton Ltd. doubled over the same period. "Glencore is just generating tons of cash from those [coal] assets," said Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina.
Glencore's decision to expand in coal might look less charmed if and when global warming and pollution concerns cut into demand.
Other mining companies have shied away from the market. Rio Tinto completed its exit from the coal market earlier this year. BHP has almost halved its exposure through divestments in recent years and in April quit the World Coal Association over the industry group's position on climate change. Anglo American PLC has sold off its Australian thermal coal assets.
The diverging strategies on coal show how companies are grappling with a long-predicted transition in energy consumption.
Recent gains in coal prices are a reminder that timing this expected switch into gas and renewables can be tricky, with mining firms liable to leave money on the table from their coal assets.
While renewables and gas are making inroads into Western power markets that have long depended on coal, emerging markets in Asia remain hungry for large, cheap sources of energy, increasing their coal demand. Some in the market say that at least in the near term, the lack of investment in coal mining can offset the impact from softening demand, leading to higher prices.
Mark Cutifani, chief executive of Anglo American, said in an interview that thermal coal -- the type of coal used in heating and power generation -- will be strong for the next "five to seven years."
But "beyond that it gets a lot harder to forecast because of the climate-change issues," he said. "We think switching will occur quicker than most people think."
Mr. Cutifani said that while Anglo American would continue supporting its remaining thermal coal operations, the company was unlikely to make major investments in the sector.
Mining companies have been very cautious about investing in new projects across commodities broadly, and given the longer-term uncertainties surrounding coal, investments in new coal projects have been particularly less likely.
For companies still interested in the sector, like Glencore, it can be cheaper to acquire unwanted mines from other parties than invest in new mines or expand existing operations. That further slows the pace of supply growth.

Full text: Raucous West Virginia rallies notwithstanding, President Trump has thus far failed to deliver on his campaign promise to resuscitate the coal industry. This is mainly for lack of political will in his administration to address the climate-change elephant in the room. While Mr. Trump has rolled back key components of the Obama anticoal agenda such as the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plan, these moves were part of a broader deregulatory push, with no discussion of whether addressing climate change is a worthy policy goal overall.
But actions that at first might have seemed like careful first steps of rolling back the Obama climate agenda have proved to be mere half-measures. The Affordable Clean Energy rule, proposed last month by the Environmental Protection Agency, made clear that the Trump administration has officially conceded the argument over man-made global warming and the need to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. This capitulation will seal the fate of the domestic coal industry over the coming years and have broad negative implications for U.S. energy policy over the longer term.
Under the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA will allow states to set their own emissions standards for coal-fired power plants, in line with federal guidance toward heat-rate efficiency improvements and based on a range of alternative technologies. Such a state-based approach would be positive for the coal industry if the Clean Power Plan and similar regulations had merely been anomalous examples of federal overreach. They weren't. Rather, President Obama's war on coal was the extension of an equally aggressive climate-change-driven regulatory campaign at the state level.
In the early 2000s, there was a concerted push by states to replace fossil fuels by adopting Renewable Portfolio Standards, which require utilities to generate or sell a specified percentage of their overall energy mix from wind and solar. As of this year, 29 states have adopted Renewable Portfolio Standards or a similar renewable-energy mandate. Most renewable-power targets far outpace market demand and are set up to increase over time, with some state goals bordering on delusional. New York, for example, wants to generate 50% of its power from renewable sources by 2030, even though such a goal would require covering nearly 1,000 square miles of the Empire State with wind turbines and solar panels. California recently passed legislation mandating completely carbon-free electricity by 2045.
Driven by these goals -- and fueled by various government tax subsidies -- total wind and solar power nameplate capacity grew sixfold between 2007 and 2016, the latest year for which Energy Department data is available. Given flat U.S. electricity demand since the 2008 recession, such excess renewable capacity has served to depress wholesale power prices and crowd out sources such as coal that provide continuous power not dependent on weather.
State utility commissions also serve as gatekeepers for the construction of all electricity generation facilities. Because most states' goals are set in percentage terms, they can achieve their goals both by adding wind and solar to the numerator and keeping coal out of the denominator.
A decade ago, coal-fired power plants supplied almost 50% of U.S. electricity. Today, the figure stands between 25% and 30% and continues to drop. In turn, domestic coal production has declined more than one-third since 2008, to a level not seen since the 1970s.
It has been five years since the last new coal-fired power plant was brought online in the U.S. Any utility executive proposing to build another one in the current political and regulatory environment would be taking on significant risk for his company and his career. Utility management teams have so far responded tepidly to the Trump administration's rule turning regulation over to the states.
While states may be the laboratories of democracy, the low-carbon regulatory experiment will stress the reliability and stability of the national electricity grid. An additional 25% of coal-fired generating capacity is slated for retirement over the next seven years, while a vast amount of new intermittent wind and solar power is projected to come online. The Affordable Clean Energy rule may slow this shuttering process, but it will not change the trajectory of the coal industry.
The Trump administration's new rule explicitly recognizes the goal of reducing carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse-gas emissions, tacitly affirming the Obama EPA's 2009 Endangerment Finding. And by punting policy to the states, the administration has legitimized an array of energy infrastructure assets -- including refineries, processing plants, terminals and pipelines -- as potential stationary targets for overzealous regulators at the state level.
The first comprehensive Clean Air Act, the foundation of America's modern environmental policy, was passed in 1970 with bipartisan support -- and no mention of carbon dioxide as a pollutant. In the less than 50 years since, judicial and state activism have subjected the U.S. economy to innumerable carbon-dioxide restrictions, with Congress having had no say over the matter. This wave of regulation has progressed unchecked despite the strategic economic importance of the energy sector and Congress's constitutional authority to regulate commerce.
Along the way, this backdoor process has been abetted by Republican complacency, with the Affordable Clean Energy rule being just the latest example. Absent stronger federal leadership, U.S. energy policy will soon become a hodgepodge of state climate-change initiatives, subject to fluctuation with every local election and administrative ruling, with the economic impact felt by the entire country.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Tuesday proposed less-stringent requirements for oil and gas companies dealing with methane-gas leaks, weakening an Obama administration rule intended to combat climate change.
The Environmental Protection Agency's proposed changes give drillers more time both between inspections and to repair leaks when they happen.
Heat-trapping methane often leaks from oil and gas wells, storage tanks and processing plants. It is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide in the short term, and its release into the atmosphere has been identified by scientists as a key source of climate change.
Industry groups had said the Obama-era requirements were overly burdensome and unrealistic.
"For too long, the federal bureaucracy has buried our industry in unnecessary and often duplicative red-tape," Barry Russell, the head of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said in a statement.
The proposed rule would only require well inspections once a year, or every other year for some low-production wells, rather than every six months as in the current rule. It would also give companies 60 days to repair leaks -- twice the amount of time allotted under the Obama-era requirement.
Other changes include allowing in-house engineers with the necessary expertise to monitor certain emissions systems, according to the document.
The EPA said the changes will save the industry $75 million a year. Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement that the changes will "give the energy sector the regulatory certainty it needs to continue providing affordable and reliable energy."
A weakening of the rule had been expected for months. The proposal will be open for public comments for 60 days.
Environmental groups decried the proposed changes as deferring to industry and predicted the measures would exacerbate climate change and hurt public health. "This is just another attempt by the EPA to weaken the common-sense requirements for operators to look for, and repair, leaks in their operations," said Darin Schroeder of the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group.

Full text: The Trump administration is about to propose its latest rollback of Obama-era climate rules, moving to ease requirements for oil and gas companies that were designed to limit leaks of the heat-trapping gas methane, administration officials said.
The Environmental Protection Agency plans to release on Wednesday a proposal that would make it easier for oil and gas companies to comply with rules designed to limit the amount of methane released into the atmosphere.
The EPA proposal aims to ensure oil and gas companies have more time to assess and safely repair infrastructure, often in remote locations, according to a draft summary of the proposal.
The proposed changes, among other measures, would give drillers a year to do leak inspections instead of just six months and 60 days to make repairs instead of 30, the document said.
Environmentalists are likely to oppose the plan, asserting the delayed inspections and repair schedules are likely to increase the amount of harmful gases released into the environment and that the proposal opens the door to further rollbacks of climate regulations.
The proposal follows other moves by the EPA earlier this year to ease climate rules, including measures to roll back restrictions on carbon emissions from both power plants and automobiles.
Carbon and methane are considered to be two big drivers of climate change. Methane, however, is an even more potent greenhouse gas than carbon over the short term and frequently leaks from oil and gas wells, storage tanks and processing plants.
Former President Barack Obama's administration set more stringent rules to address methane leaks. The rules were supposed to be a fundamental part of its effort to slow climate change.
The energy industry has long complained those rules amounted to regulatory overreach, claims adopted by the Trump administration, which includes among its ranks many former employees and allies of the energy industry.
The EPA plan is coming as the Interior Department also pushes its own proposal that would virtually eliminate its Obama-era rules aimed at cutting emissions of methane from drilling operations on federal lands.
News of the impending release of the methane proposal was reported earlier Monday by the New York Times.
While many of the proposal's details are incremental, and relatively technical, more wide-sweeping changes are still under consideration. The draft summary says the agency will issue a separate proposal later on its regulation of the oil-and-gas sector's greenhouse gas emissions. Environmentalists are concerned that foreshadows an ultimate effort to gut the agency's oversight over methane from oil and gas operations.

Full text: California Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday signed a controversial and aggressive new law for the state to mandate carbon-free electricity by 2045.
The Democratic governor went further by also issuing an executive order for the entire state, and not just its electric industry, to become carbon neutral by 2045 and net greenhouse gas negative thereafter.
Mr. Brown admitted that there are huge steps ahead needed to help achieve these goals, including his call to set up a regional electric grid for the West.
"But it must be done," Mr. Brown said in a signing ceremony Monday morning at the Statehouse in Sacramento. "California is committed to doing whatever is necessary to meet the existential threat of climate change. No matter what the naysayers may say, it is a real, present danger to California and people of the world."
The much-anticipated signing puts California at odds with President Trump, who announced last year the U.S. would withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate accord that has been signed by every nation on the planet.
Mr. Brown subsequently joined the governors of New York and Washington in forming an alliance to continue abiding by the terms the agreement, which has since been joined by other states.
In the ceremony attended by the governor and Democratic legislators, only indirect mention was made of Mr. Trump, who has tangled with the Democratic-dominated state on a host of issues.
"Regardless of who occupies the White House, California will always lead on climate change," said state Sen. Kevin de Leon, who wrote the new law.
Mr. de Leon is waging a long-shot bid to unseat veteran Sen. Dianne Feinstein in November.
White House officials didn't immediately comment on the governor's action. The law has been opposed by utility companies, which argued the changeover to zero-carbon mandate may not be financially feasible. Other groups have expressed concern over the possible impacts on the access and affordability of electricity.
"Gov. Brown signed SB 100 despite real concerns about grid reliability and higher costs for consumers and businesses," said Dorothy Rothrock, president of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association.
Mr. Brown signed the bill into law two days before the opening in San Francisco of the Global Action Climate Summit, where he will play host to business and governmental leaders seeking to take action on the issue despite the Trump administration's reluctance.
California is the first large state to set a goal of carbon-free electricity generation under the new law, which passed the state Legislature late last month.
In a signing statement, Mr. Brown suggested a variety of strategies to achieving the zero-carbon goal, including energy storage, increased efficiency and adjusting energy use to when there is the most power available.
The governor also called for a multistate power grid that would allow California to share electricity with other Western states, which some environmentalists have opposed due to concerns the state would import energy produced by coal. The state Legislature this summer failed to pass a bill moving toward that goal.
"Have no illusions: California and the rest of the world have miles to go before we achieve zero-carbon emissions," Mr. Brown said. "But you have to begin."

Full text: Coal is clinging to the top spot in power generation, accounting for as much of the world's electricity as it did two decades ago, despite heightened concerns about climate change and a slowdown in financing for projects involving the dirtiest of fossil fuels.
U.S. exports of coal more than doubled in 2017 and are set to grow this year, according to the Energy Information Administration. Countries across Asia and Africa are expected to increase their use of coal for expanding power generation through 2040, says the EIA.
The rebound shows coal's resilience, especially in emerging regions, and recent events suggest the market for black combustible rock will remain strong. In the U.S., the Trump administration has proposed reversing U.S. rules on coal emissions, and countries including India and Vietnam are planning major coal projects.
Coal accounted for 38% of the world's electric power generation in 2017, putting it at the same level as in 1998, according to a recent report by BP PLC. A revival of the thermal coal market last year helped to lift mining companies' earnings and share prices. Among them was Glencore PLC, one of the world's largest mining concerns. In March, it spent $1.7 billion for coal assets in Australia as part of a bet that demand for coal in Southeast Asia will remain robust.
Meanwhile, global carbon emissions from coal and other fossil fuels rose 1.4% in 2017 after three flat years. The rise is attributed to economic growth and increasing energy demand in Asia, according to the IEA. Emissions are linked to rising global temperatures and more extreme weather patterns, experts say, and coal is a leading contributor to human health problems.
The World Bank stopped financing coal in 2010 because of the hydrocarbon's link to global warming, and many international banks are turning away from fossil-fuel projects. Last year, Deutsche Bank said it wouldn't grant financing for new coal mining or coal-powered projects. In July, Lloyds Banking Group said it would stop extending loans for new coal ventures.
Still, coal plants are attractive because they are less expensive to build than renewable-energy facilities. The cost of constructing a renewables plant is roughly double the outlay of a fossil-fuel facility, experts say.
Government officials in developing nations, many of whom say they want to curb the use of coal to combat climate change, often face the difficult challenge of doing so without slowing economic growth. That tricky balance is seen particularly in Nigeria, where coal is abundant and cheap yet some 54% of the country's 190 million citizens lack access to electricity. The country has a plan under way to deliver power from coal-fired plants to more of its people.
Today, Nigeria generates all of its power with a mix of hydroelectric dams and natural gas, but frequent vandalism of pipelines causes power shortages. By 2030, Africa's biggest economy plans to add 30 gigawatts of power, of which about 30% will be produced by renewable sources and about 3% will be from coal. The project will cost about $3.5 billion a year.
The World Bank approved a $350 million loan for solar mini-grids and other equipment to provide electricity in Nigeria. But the bank has said it would no longer finance projects involving coal -- anywhere in the world. Bank officials say countries looking to fund coal ventures should look to the private sector.
"I think it's simplistic to begin to separate renewable energy from fossil fuel," said Babatunde Fashola, Nigeria's minister of power, works and housing. "What the world really needs is to achieve a balance."
There are some 2 billion tons of coal in the country, according to estimates, and economists say putting it to use to spread power could be a boon for the economy.
Many emerging nations are fighting similar issues, even as more prosperous countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. have reduced the use of coal to produce electricity.
On the Asian continent, home of the world's largest coal reserves, China and India account for most of the growth in coal use. Vietnam plans a fivefold increase in its coal capacity through 2035, according to the Clean Coal Centre, a division of the IEA.
Bangladesh plans to use coal to generate 50% of the country's power by 2030, up from 2% today. Like many countries in the region, it is funding its expansion with loans and technological help from China and Japan. Toshiba Corp. and other partners are building a coal power plant and port on Matarbari Island in Bangladesh. The project will cost about $4 billion, with most of its financing coming from the Japan International Cooperation Agency.

Full text: The Trump administration moved to overturn Obama-era environmental rules on power-plant emissions, a long-telegraphed action designed to help coal-burning plants compete with natural gas and other cleaner alternatives as a national energy source.
Andrew Wheeler, President Trump's acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, on Monday signed aproposal to scrap environmental restrictions on power plants and leave much of the regulation of the industry to states. The move is the agency's first under Mr. Trump to detail how it will regulate the power-sector carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, and it sets up months of public and legal reviews, and potentially a yearslong court battle.
Environmental groups are plotting a challenge, saying the proposal at best provides minimal legal cover for a 2007 Supreme Court decision requiring the agency to regulate carbon emissions as a pollutant. They will likely seek to reinstate the Obama-era policy, called the Clean Power Plan, which itself is hung up at the Supreme Court in a case about whether it was illegally broad.
The new plan recommends a menu of upgrades designed to let coal-fired plants produce energy withless fuel and seeks to eliminate triggers that mandate costly technological overhauls at coal plants. While the Clean Power Plan was designed to reduce greenhouse gases and fight the cause of climate change, the Trump administration cast the regulation as setting unfair rules that coal plants wouldn't be able to meet.
"The entire Obama administration plan was centered around doing away with coal," Mr. Wheeler said in an interview.
Coal has long been a primary source of power in the U.S., but in recent years it has faced stiff competition from cheaper and cleaner alternatives. As a result, the ultimate effect of the Trump EPA move could be limited. The agency's own numbers forecast the power sector's coal consumption to keep shrinking under this proposal, though at a slower rate. Coal-industry leaders say they need major changes to how wholesale markets operate to make coal more competitive.
Power companies have already said they expect to keep up a large-scale shift to cleaner fuels. Natural gas is cheaper today than coal, and its supply is still growing rapidly, while prices for wind and solar keep dropping, too.
Roughly 40% of the nation's coal-fired power plants have shut or announced plans to close, according to the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group.
The worst of that fall is past, but the proposal is most likely just enough to help support the industry's stabilization, said Hal Quinn, president and chief executive of the National Mining Association.
The Clean Power Plan "was a major impediment for our industry going forward in terms of what our markets look like," Mr. Quinn said. "This removes that pressure."
Mr. Trump's energy team has argued that coal is a crucial fuel source and that its decline is a threat to the ability of electricity distributors to supply businesses and consumers. The Energy Department has made similar arguments in separate proposals to help struggling coal and nuclear-plant operators.
Environmentalists have criticized the administration's conclusions. Coal emissions from the power sector are one of the nation's biggest sources of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change, and the proposal could increase carbon emissions by helping coal-burning plants to run harder and stay open longer. Coal is also a leading contributor to human health problems.
Obama-era EPA leadership said Monday that their moves were a careful effort to follow a legal requirement to regulate carbon emissions. Gina McCarthy, the administrator who approved the Clean Power Plan, noted the influence of climate change is becoming tangible -- deadly heat waves and rising sea levels -- and said the new proposal's scaled-back mandates do little to address it.
"That is essentially a huge gimme to coal-power plants by giving them a free pass," she said.
While the proposal meets many of the headline demands the coal industry has made for years, Mr. Wheeler, himself a former coal industry lobbyist, denied it is designed to save coal. Instead, he stressedthe effort gives the states authority to make determinations on which fuels should be part of their electricity system.
Mr. Trump has made support of the coal industry a central part of his platform, embracing donors from the industry and hosting coal miners at the White House.
"Obviously the president thinks he appeals to his base by talking about bringing back coal," said David Doniger, senior strategic director of climate and clean energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council and former director of climate change policy at the Clinton-era EPA. "But the policies are not going to bring back coal."

Full text: The Trump administration is escalating an effort to revive the flagging U.S. coal industry with a planned move this week to replace restrictive Obama-era climate policies with new rules designed to help coal-burning plants run harder and stay open longer.
The proposed rules from the Environmental Protection Agency would be the latest in a series of reversals of policies the Obama administration adopted to slow climate change. They would replace the agency's so-called Clean Power Plan for the electricity business with regulations that cede power to states. The rules could ultimately lead to more heat-trapping gases going into the atmosphere even as they set parameters to boost efficiency at coal-fired power plants.
President Trump has repeatedly promised to support coal, an industry beset by a shrinking customer base, competition, falling prices and bankruptcies.
Plummeting costs of cleaner fuels including natural gas, wind and solar in recent years have driven consumers and power companies away from coal so dramatically they may blunt the proposal's ultimate effect.
The Trump administration proposal would have to be submitted for a public rule-making process before taking effect. It would apply to the power industry at large, but is targeted at coal.
Senior administration officials familiar with the proposal say it outlines technology that coal-burning plants can employ to produce more power from less fuel. It would also eliminate triggers that would mandate overhauls at plants, a rollback to encourage coal-burning units to make smaller improvements, which could extend the profitable lifespans of those plants by many years.
Administration officials say the upshot would be existing coal-fired plants that burn cleaner, and they estimate efficiency gains of about 4%.
The proposed rules are designed to address what many conservatives and coal-industry supporters criticized as overreach by the Obama administration determined to force coal plants to run less frequently and close more quickly.
"We don't believe that is our role," one senior agency official said. This "is about doing more with what you have, and then letting the market trends do what they're going to do anyway."
Environmentalists are critical of those changes. Even if coal plants run more efficiently, the lack of any requirement to adopt the most recent environmental controls means plants are likely to put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than they would if the country's grid simply replaced coal with cleaner fuels like wind and solar.
"The most massive change from the Clean Power Plan here is how little this does to address climate change," said Conrad Schneider, advocacy director, Clear Air Task Force.
The anticipated legal tussles mean the proposal this week is just one step in a process that may still take years to complete. The proposal will next go for public comment and then likely take months of review to complete.
Some observers say the legal wrangling could leave the issue unresolved well into the next presidential administration.
When it completed the Clean Power Plan, the Obama-era EPA's regulatory analysis said about 27 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity might be put in a position to shut down by 2030. But rapid market changes have accelerated the trend faster than many expected, and about 40% of the country's coal-fired fleet is now closed or planning to close, said Michelle Bloodworth, president and chief executive of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a coal-industry advocacy group. More changes in wholesale markets would likely be needed to reverse coal's fortunes, she added.
"We're certainly pleased and supportive of the administration rolling back what we thought were harmful regulations," she said.

Legal Challenges
Are Anticipated
Only a few years ago, coal was the country's primary source of power -- and also one of the leading sources of the greenhouse gases blamed for climate change and of pollutants, including mercury, known to harm human health.
That has been central to a decadeslong battle over the EPA's role in regulating how much carbon industrial businesses dispose of into the atmosphere.
While some conservatives would simply like to eliminate EPA oversight, the Supreme Court has ruled the EPA must regulate carbon as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That led to the Obama-era plan, which required states to reduce emissions broadly.
The Trump administration, with its new proposal, is trying to walk a fine line of minimizing federal mandates while still fulfilling legal requirements under the Clean Air Act. Environmental advocates are expected to launch legal challenges to the Trump administration's rollback, and the new rules are designed to withstand such lawsuits.
"It's a pretty tight needle to thread," said Bob Perciasepe, who was deputy EPA administrator under President Obama and chief of the EPA's air and water divisions during the Clinton administration. "This starts to send mixed signals to the industry and [likely] creates another several years of litigation."

Full text: Seaweed Chronicles
By Susan Hand Shetterly
Algonquin, 271 pages, $24.95
Once, on a day of high winds and salt spray, on the island of North Ronaldsay, the northernmost of the Orkney Islands of Scotland, I watched a flock of sheep clattering over the rocks at low tide among a herd of resting seals. It looked both perilous and peculiar, but the North Ronaldsay sheep are shore dwellers, bred for generations to live in a seascape and feed on seaweed. Farmers on the island a couple of centuries ago, adapting to changes in farming as the production of soda ash from kelp subsided, consigned the sheep to the island's rocky shore and kept them away from the crops with a stone dike that today still encircles the island.
Throughout history, maritime communities around the world have learned to face uncertainty with similar resolve -- and recognized the importance of seaweed for their survival. In "Seaweed Chronicles," Susan Hand Shetterly introduces us to the cultural heritage of seaweed in the Gulf of Maine and to the industry and politics of modern-day seaweed growing and harvesting. As kelp has increasingly been recognized as a source of "superfood" over the past two decades, the business of harvested seaweeds has grown to about $6 billion a year, bringing new jobs to coastal areas as fishing has declined. Ms. Shetterly's is a story about the sustenance, use and preservation of finite resources, where aquaculture -- specifically, the sustainable farming of seaweed -- emerges as the key to ecological redemption.
As in her previous collection of essays "Settled in the Wild" (2010), Ms. Shetterly writes beautifully about the interconnectedness of humans and animals and the natural environment that we share. The twinned concepts of community and belonging are central to this story. By exploring the land where we live, we can begin to understand our place in the world.
"Seaweed Chronicles" is an elegy to environmentalism and to the individuals in Ms. Shetterly's local community who are committed to the stewardship of coastal Maine's natural habitat. Quoting Aldo Leopold, she reminds us that the true task of the environmentalist -- the challenge for us all -- is to "live on a piece of land without spoiling it."
"Solastalgia" is a relatively new word for the angst one feels when a familiar place is altered by climate change. This worry is palpable in Ms. Shetterly's book, together with a longing for a world that can withstand the complexity and flux of our current society. Her bay in Maine has changed, Ms. Shetterly writes, and among the members of her community there is a real and tender sense of loss. "We have lost the abundance that used to be a part of the definition of this place, and the changing climate bears down especially hard. And yet so many of us work to understand where we live, to use what's left of wild water and shore carefully and well. Perhaps that makes us unrealistic dreamers. Perhaps it makes us steely-eyed realists. Certainly it makes us fighters."
"Wild" is a central value here, but the concept is tricky in our current age, when the human hand has influenced most of what we think of as "natural." The Gulf of Maine is a cultural environment and, increasingly, a political one. Running through the book is a story about the challenges of agreeing on a policy that meets the interests of individual harvesters and companies as well as conservationists, who are increasingly in competition in the face of industrialization.
To Ms. Shetterly, hope lies in the endeavors of the aquaculturalists, scientists and entrepreneurs she interviews. These individuals are strong, practical types: often well-educated, idealistic, committed and entitled. She writes soothingly and with generous insight about this community, where one might like to linger for a moment and rest from the harsh realities of a more complex world.
She sits down by an open fire one evening for a conversation with Shep and Linnette Erhart, owners of Maine Coast Sea Vegetables, about the farming of nori for sushi, as the tide comes in and two black bears pass through the meadow outside. Kelp farmer Sarah Redmond looks like she "had stepped straight out of a Jane Austen novel" but is clearly more of a powerhouse than a chatterbox: a driving spirit behind the local development of aquaculture. Writer Paul Molyneaux used to be a fisherman and could hear the tide turn from the way it "slaps the rocks a little differently when it starts coming back." Nancy Sferra is a biologist, conservationist and policy maker who speaks "clearly and briefly," "listens carefully," "states what she believes" and, over the past two decades, has been instrumental in protecting some of the most valuable seascapes in Maine. You get the sense that it is individuals like these -- hardy if humble heroes, knights of the shining rockweed -- who will keep it all steady and help us reconnect with the natural world.
Ms. Shetterly is convinced and convincing about what constitutes a meaningful existence. "Out here, the picture looks pretty clear: everything else is in flux, but the seaweeds are still a constant in places like this where animals and people come, as they have always done, to make their lives good." Perhaps for this reason she sometimes takes a rather romantic approach. To work in the midst of beauty, she suggests to Ms. Redmond the kelp farmer, is "a gift that few people are able to enjoy, although one might make the argument that it's a human birthright of sorts, working where the sun rises, the day clears, the smells of the wild world are all around you, and you are a part of something very old, very big." Ms. Redmond laughs at this, reminding Ms. Shetterly what it is like to work on the sea in winter, and I, too, have to protest a little at this point. There is no need to be didactic about place; surely we are all able to perceive beauty -- or its absence -- in our life and work.
In the end, this is not about turning back the clock or calling for a global shift in behavior, but about a philosophy. "Seaweed Chronicles" is a local affair and, as such, gives more justice to Ms. Shetterly's endeavor and closes in on something real. "Attention," Simone Weil once wrote, "is the rarest and purest form of generosity." Ms. Shetterly is simply urging us to pay attention to nature, to live deliberately, to take stock of the things around us that we don't want to lose.
There may be bigger challenges in the world today than the growing and harvesting of seaweed, but the responsibility and care -- the paying attention -- that the individuals in Ms. Shetterly's seascape represent endow us with the fortitude to do the same.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Securities regulators dropped an investigation into whether Exxon Mobil Corp. misled investors about its accounting practices and the risks that climate change and greenhouse-gas regulations posed to its business.
The Securities and Exchange Commission in a Thursday letter informed Exxon that it closed the probe and decided against trying to penalize the energy giant over its disclosures and how it valued oil and gas assets. The letter was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Exxon in a statement confirmed the probe had ended, saying it began in January 2016 and involved more than 4.2 million pages of records. "After a thorough investigation, including a review of these documents, the SEC issued its closure letter," company spokesman Scott Silvestri said in the statement.
The SEC's investigation began under former chairman Mary Jo White, who was picked by former President Obama. It ended under SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a new leader appointed by President Trump. The decision ends what was a surprise foray by the federal regulator into questioning how a major oil producer valued its assets in a world of increasing climate-change regulations.
An SEC spokesman declined to comment.
Investigations by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts continue into how Exxon has accounted for the impact of climate change on its assets. New York investigators have alleged in court papers that Exxon appears to have used internal estimates to account for climate impacts that differed from public statements. Exxon has denied those charges and said its statements accurately reflect the "proxy cost" of carbon it uses in internal estimates.
Before the probes began, Exxon was the only major oil-and-gas company that hadn't written down the value of its reserves in the previous decade, an issue New York investigators had taken an interest in. In accounting terms, the value of such assets often falls when prices decline. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, Exxon has booked more than $3 billion of impairments.
Under U.S. law, public companies must tell shareholders about risks or uncertainties that matter to shareholders' investment decisions. Environmental groups and some activist investors have pushed the SEC to force companies to disclose more about how they weigh their exposure to climate change.
The SEC advised public companies in 2010 that they should consider the impact of greenhouse-gas regulations, international agreements among governments to limit emissions, and the physical effects of climate change, such as severe weather. The SEC said all of those factors wouldn't apply to every public company, and it declined to mandate any specific disclosures about climate change.
Securities lawyers say the decision is specific to Exxon's case and may not portend a change in terms of how the SEC reviews companies' statements about climate change. Proving that a company suppressed the threat of climate change is difficult because the trend may not immediately -- or anytime soon -- affect its performance.
"Given the time horizon over which climate change could have an impact, it's challenging to prove that any risk or uncertainty is material to a company in the present day," said Keith Higgins, a former SEC director and now chairman of the securities and governance practice at Ropes & Gray LLP.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration took direct aim Thursday at California's role as de facto auto regulator for the nation, proposing to end the state's ability to set its own fuel-efficiency standards and to dial back Obama-era limits on tailpipe emissions.
The proposal would eliminate the sharp increase in fuel-economy mandates adopted under the Obama administration in collaboration with California. The rules require car makers to boost fuel efficiency to 50 miles a gallon on average by 2025, thereby cutting emissions.
The Trump administration wants to cut that to 37 miles a gallon -- one of its biggest rollbacks yet of former President Obama's efforts to fight climate change. It says the prior proposals overestimated how quickly consumers would adopt cleaner cars and trucks because, according to Trump administration officials, they will cost more.
The Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department say their proposal will help the car industry by easing mandates and lowering sticker prices to entice more buyers.
California, with a population of 40 million and the country's largest car market, has long been a leader on issues involving air quality and climate change. Its push for stringent regulations has made it an influential testing ground for policies cheered by environmentalists but derided by some industry leaders.
Given California's historic problem with smog, Congress has granted the state waivers through the years to impose stricter pollution-control measures than those of the federal government. But California also has vast influence in setting standards for the national auto market. Up to 12 other states follow its lead and adopt its rules, and the current Obama-era regulations largely follow those mandates.
The Trump administration's move is an effort to seize back regulatory authority from a state that critics say takes its clean air initiative to extremes. The proposal seeks to override state standard setters in favor of "one national standard . . . set exclusively by the Federal government."
"Our job is to do what's right for all Americans," Heidi King, deputy administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in an interview.
The auto industry is leery of any proposal that stops progress toward better fuel economy for fear of a public backlash, even though it views the current rules as too stringent.
Auto executives are urging the administration to negotiate a deal with California before finalizing its rules, projected to happen this winter.
Given the number of states that follow California's lead, mostly in the Northeast and Northwest, car makers say they fear the Trump administration's aggressive rollback of fuel-economy standards will force states to go their own ways. They want to avoid a patchwork of regulations and the costly variations in vehicle design that could create.
The industry's two largest lobbying groups sent a letter Thursday to both Mr. Trump and California's governor asking for a deal.
"We think somewhere between the administration's preferred path and between the Obama numbers there's a place that works," said Mitch Bainwol, head of the Auto Alliance, which represents a dozen auto makers. "Our belief is the path is not one of litigation but one of compromise."
The administration proposal, which is subject to a 60-day public comment period, would still raise fuel-efficiency mandates through 2020 but then hold them there, significantly lowering the longer-term requirements through 2026 to an average of 37 miles a gallon.
Trump administration officials have said they want to avoid plunging auto makers into years of uncertainty, but not at the expense of vehicle safety improvements they say are essential. They put negotiations on hold in recent weeks as they finalized their proposal, and have said they are eager to hear from California during the public comment period.
California has already sued the administration over its auto policies, and its leaders said Thursday they see the administration's moves as an open attack on national rules the state helped set. They disputed the administration's findings and pledged to ramp up their legal efforts, setting the stage for what could be a seminal battle over who controls car industry standards.
Many lawyers and car industry lobbyists expect the Trump administration would face a yearslong legal battle and a Supreme Court decision to override California's power.
On Thursday, California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, called the Trump administration moves "an assault on the health of Americans everywhere."
"Under his reckless scheme, motorists will pay more at the pump, get worse gas mileage and breathe dirtier air," Mr. Brown said. "California will fight this stupidity in every conceivable way possible."
Because car makers start developing new models years in advance, the lack of clarity around regulations creates a challenge when trying to decide where to allocate investments.
Many car companies already are developing more-efficient vehicles for overseas markets, such as China and Europe, where emissions regulations are getting stricter. They are unlikely to halt those efforts soon, said Dave Sullivan, an auto analyst for AutoPacific Inc.
"Auto makers are also looking further down the road because who is to say in six years the fuel economy standards won't change again" with a new U.S. president, he said.
California anticipated the Trump administration moves and has been bracing for a fight for months. Earlier this year, Mr. Brown signed an executive order calling for five million zero-emission vehicles on California roads by 2030.
Mr. Brown often warns of climate change in apocalyptic terms, and has made curbing emissions from industry, with an increasing focus on the transportation sector, central to the state's policies. Under a law he signed in 2016 the state set the target of reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions to 40% below the state's 1990 levels by 2030, one of the most ambitious standards in the world.
California has about a quarter of the nation's 4.1 million traditional hybrid gas-electric vehicles on its roads, 190,000 of the nation's 389,000 pure-electric vehicles and 175,000 of its 382,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles, according to Edmunds.

Full text: Together, science and capitalism built the modern world. But across the political spectrum, both are under attack. If we are to solve our greatest challenges, including climate change, we have to deploy the power of these twin engines of civilization.
The best available research confirms the existence of human-driven climate change, including the rapid pace of global warming. Leading scientists' predictions of temperature rise have been largely accurate. In the three decades since NASA climate scientist James Hansen first warned Congress that global warming had begun, the U.S. and other nations have poured billions of tons of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, and the planet has continued to warm.
Most climate models predicted warming above the mid-20th-century average of about 1 degree Celsius by 2016. They were right. Atmospheric scientists predicted increased frequency of extreme-heat events, and they were right, too. Scientists also predicted warming would be most apparent in East Asia and the Arctic, and it is.
These results aren't surprising, given that they are based on many independent data sets. Measurements are collected by towers, buoys, aircraft, satellites and more, and are assessed by thousands of scientists world-wide.
It's a sign of the reliability of this research that the insurance industry, with trillions in liability at stake, uses it to determine financial models. Most businesses can't afford to have "political" opinions about climate change. For companies facing potential impacts from climate trends, to deny warming would be like Macy's pretending online shopping isn't disrupting retail.
Unfortunately, skeptics have fostered doubt about climate change by misrepresenting the research. Some have claimed that Mr. Hansen's models failed to predict temperatures accurately, but these evaluations use measurements based on major calibration errors. Researchers critical of mainstream climate science also have expressed doubt about the growing intensity of extreme-weather events, which in fact are more intense than they were 30 years ago, due to warmer oceans and other climate-related factors. And many have suggested that the rise of global temperature has paused or plateaued recently, though reliable records show this isn't the case. Onetime climate skeptic Jerry Taylor, a former vice president of the Cato Institute, changed his views when he reread Mr. Hansen's testimony and realized its predictions were "spot on."
Arguments about climate science may be useful for politicians looking to whip up voters, but misinformation doesn't help us plan to protect future economic growth. Citigroup estimates the cost of unchecked climate change will be in the tens of trillions. The president of the Reinsurance Association of America says global warming could bankrupt his industry. Even fossil-fuel companies like Exxon Mobil and Shell have expressed the urgent need to manage the risks of climate change.
This brings us back to capitalism. Climate change is a byproduct of the prosperity created by the market economy, but the market similarly can be an engine to generate cost-effective solutions. Clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar power already have developed immensely in the past two decades. Public policy that puts a price on carbon emissions would speed the adoption of clean energy by exposing the market to the costs this pollution puts on society. This will accelerate adoption of and private investment in clean-energy technologies.
Though climate change presents American industries a daunting challenge, market-based policies can unleash innovation from investors, inventors and entrepreneurs, who will work to build a more prosperous and safer future. Working with accurate scientific facts and the right incentives, the market will find winning solutions.
So let's follow the data and get this done.

Full text: The Last Lobster
By Christopher White
(St. Martin's, 240 pages, $26.99)
With its alarming title and troubling statistics, "The Last Lobster," Christopher White's deep dive into the $1.7 billion Maine lobster industry, blares foghorn warnings about a business and a culture under threat. As in Paul Greenberg's 2010 book, "Four Fish: The Future of the Last Wild Food," one culprit is overfishing. But Mr. White's ambitious book -- as stuffed with facts as Lobster Thermidor is stuffed with claw meat and cream -- also addresses climate change, supply and demand, and international trade. Above all, it offers vivid, well-observed portraits of people directly affected by lobster's recent boom-and-bust cycles.
A journalistic Ahab, Mr. White tenaciously chases his whale of a story over the course of four years. He sets up base camp in Stonington, Maine, a not-yet-gentrified Mid-Coast lobster village on Deer Isle, which sits in the Gulf of Maine between Penobscot and Jericho Bays. Stonington's year-round population of 1,200 includes 350 lobster captains, 450 sternmen, and dozens of dealers, dockworkers and seafood restaurant workers. "In other words," Mr. White writes, "nearly three-quarters of the residents actively work in the industry. The remainder are relatives. The town has a singular purpose; it stands for something -- getting lobsters from the ocean floor to the family table, sustainably."
Stonington's population doubles in summer with vacationers, but Mr. White is interested in the locals, and he gets to know many of them as he traces the lobster's path from sea to market. Snatches of dry Maine humor provide welcome respite from a deluge of eye-opening but sometimes repetitive or conflicting numbers (including the year-round head count, variously reported as 1,100 or 1,200).
In pursuit of his story, Mr. White rises before dawn and heads out to Jericho Bay with Capt. Frank Gotwals and his sternman, Alyssa LaPointe, on the Seasong, a 38-foot wooden boat that Capt. Gotwals built with his own hands. Despite working without a chart, the captain easily locates his 750 traps scattered around the islands, which he checks for sweet, summertime shedders -- newly molted adult lobsters. Mr. White remarks that Capt. Gotwals, an avid lobsterman, gardener, and celebrated Maine songwriter and guitarist in his 60s, "may be the most content man in America."
Six hundred lobsters are a modest day's catch. Mr. White describes the many steps involved in their harvest, including spotting and hooking the captain's distinctively colored buoys, hauling up traps from the ocean floor, measuring the catch and throwing back undersized and female lobsters. Claws are banded before placing the keepers in saltwater tanks, and traps baited with fresh herring before they're reset. Mr. White captures the hard work, intense concentration and banter.
The author also gets to know Julie Eaton, captain of the Cat Sass, and Sid Eaton, captain of the Kimberly Belle, a couple whose marriage runs on laughter and competition. Together, in a boom year, they make $250,000 during their 16-week season, which runs from July through October. Julie, whose preferred title is lobsterman, is one of the rising number of female captains and crew -- though women still account for only 4% of Maine's commercial lobster licenses.
Mr. White is lucky enough to witness a "wicked awesome" boom, when Maine's annual lobster harvest tops 130 million pounds -- six times the average haul during the 1980s. With lobstermen making as much as $200,000, they're riding high -- but they know it can't last. Even amid the bounty, there are worrisome price and cost fluctuations due to an oversupply of lobsters and a shortage of herring bait.
Mr. White explains how the biggest threat to this bustling industry is also part of the reason for the boom: climate change. Optimal water temperature for lobsters is between 53 and 64 degrees Fahrenheit. As oceans heat up, lobsters move north in search of cooler waters. This has occurred at a rate of 3 to 4.3 miles per year, which has added up to a northward shift of 215 miles in the last 50 years. A dearth of predators -- including overfished cod -- has also contributed to the recent lobster boom. "Lobster bottom is like a stadium full of Christians and no lions in sight," one captain comments.
"Migrating lobsters are as clear a symbol of climate change as are the melting glaciers of Montana," Mr. White writes. But at the present rate, he notes, by sometime between 2036 and 2046, "the majority of 'American' lobsters might reside in Canada." (In the epilogue, Mr. White reports that the long-expected slump hit Maine lobstermen hard in 2017, with a 16.4% decline in yield.)
This brings up another issue: trade. Chinese demand accounts for about 10% of all Maine lobster exports. In addition, 60% of Maine lobsters are trucked to Canada for processing. "The Last Lobster" was printed before the current escalating trade wars, whose economic repercussions could be calamitous.
This is not the first time Mr. White has written about the dire effects of climate change. Previous books include "The Melting World: A Journey Across America's Vanishing Glaciers" and "Skipjack: The Story of America's Last Sailing Oystermen." But in "The Last Lobster," he addresses the impact of the environment on one of America's signature fisheries with a greater sense of urgency. He untangles the complex economics of the lobster industry with admirable clarity, though a more streamlined, less repetitive magazine article might have been even more compelling. Even so, his book makes a passionate, convincing case for the need for careful marine management, and, through his chorus of lobstermen's voices, makes it in human terms.

Full text: Darren Woods spent a year preparing an ambitious plan to return Exxon Mobil Corp. to glory.
Struggling with laryngitis, the oil giant's chief executive stepped before a ballroom full of analysts and investors at the New York Stock Exchange in March and unveiled a strategy to spend more than $230 billion to double profits and pump an additional one million barrels a day of oil and gas.
As Mr. Woods walked away afterward and peered at his phone, he received an unwelcome surprise. Shareholders didn't buy it. "Our stock is down 3%," he said to another executive, looking exasperated.
Exxon faces a number of challenges, including investigations of its accounting and tax practices as well as lawsuits by cities and states seeking funds to pay for the effects of climate change. Its biggest problem is one the giant has seldom faced in its 148-year history: It isn't making as much money as it used to.
Under former CEO Rex Tillerson, Exxon bet big hunting for oil in risky, expensive locales like the Russian Arctic. But as oil prices fell, those projects didn't pay off the way Exxon had hoped. Now the $350 billion Irving, Texas, company is returning to its old ways: big, disciplined spending on prospects that make money at low oil prices.
The approach is a gamble in a new era of energy breakthroughs such as fracking and electric vehicles. Many of Exxon's competitors are transforming their businesses to move away from oil exploration, and have begun to spend carefully and diversify into renewable energy.
Investors, who once looked past Exxon's tendency toward arrogance and secrecy because of its good returns, aren't sure they want Big Oil to get bigger.
"Most investors like Exxon, but they like other companies better," said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of Adams Funds, which owns about $100 million in Exxon shares. "The market is not willing to reward Exxon for spending today in hopes that it will bring good returns tomorrow."
Exxon has been pledging to produce more oil and gas for years, but its output of about four million barrels a day is no higher today than it was after its merger with Mobil Corp. in 1999. Even if Exxon succeeds in doubling last year's earnings of $15 billion (excluding impairments and tax reform impacts) by 2025, as Mr. Woods vowed in his eight-year spending plan, it would still be making far less than in 2008, when it set what was then a record for annual profits by an American corporation, at $45 billion.
In 2016, S&P Global Ratings stripped Exxon of the triple-A credit rating it held since 1930. It was one of only three companies to hold the distinction at that time, along with Microsoft Corp. and Johnson & Johnson. While Exxon once ranked as the world's largest company by market value, it was 10th as of June 30, less than half the size of Apple Inc.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Woods declined to comment. Exxon declined to make other executives available for interviews. Exxon has denied wrongdoing related to the climate litigation and other probes it is facing, and insisted the lawsuits are the wrong way to deal with climate change.
The company traces its history back to Standard Oil, the name oil titan John D. Rockefeller gave to his powerful monopoly to signify control, order and uniform quality. The U.S. Supreme Court broke up the monopoly in 1911.
Exxon, the largest descendant of that monopoly, bears a resemblance to Standard Oil even now. While a powerful CEO sets the company's direction, Exxon is ultimately run by a committee of a handful of executives, dubbed the "God pod" by employees. Much as it was in Mr. Rockefeller's time, they divide oversight responsibility over Exxon's vast reach, which now spans 51 countries and six continents and includes more than 70,000 employees.
It became the biggest public company in the world by revenue in 1975, and over the next 3 1/2 decades it was often the most profitable, even when oil prices were low. Exxon excelled in coming through on budget and as scheduled in projects rife with political and engineering complexity.
The company's process included a painstaking analysis of all decisions, major and minor. Projects were judged based on an assumed oil price often as much as 50% or more below current or forecast prices, according to more than a dozen former employees and executives.
Its leaders confidently steered the company through oil crashes, foreign conflicts and clashes with Wall Street. Lee Raymond, Exxon's boss from 1993 to 2005, personified the swagger at the heart of the company's ethos. He was notorious for making fun of or criticizing the questions of Wall Street analysts, often to their faces, and he was equally dismissive of some shareholders at annual meetings.
That style rankled some rivals and investors, but Exxon backed it up with best-in-class performance.
Exxon's stock traded at a premium to its peers for decades, a trend that intensified after the company's purchase of Mobil. Investors at times recognized twice the value in Exxon's assets compared with rivals BP PLC, Total SA, Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC.
For years, Exxon "operated like a perfect machine," said Uday Turaga, a former ConocoPhillips executive who now runs consulting firm ADI Analytics. "It is a process-driven, extremely disciplined organization."
About a decade ago, Mr. Raymond was succeeded by Mr. Tillerson, a folksy Texan who came from the so-called upstream side of the business, which explores for and produces oil and gas, and who had a penchant for personally negotiating big oil-production deals himself.
As prices rose to all-time highs of almost $150 a barrel, Mr. Tillerson led the charge to chase more expensive prospects that could meet the world's thirst for crude. He looked to Canada's oil sands, natural gas fracking and even Russia's Arctic, all of which required higher prices to be profitable.
Those efforts largely failed. Exxon's production has declined in the past five years, and the company has delivered lackluster financial results. Today, oil prices are around $74 a barrel.
Mr. Tillerson, who left in 2017 for a short-lived stint as President Donald Trump's Secretary of State, produced returns of about 6% a year during his tenure, including dividends -- far less than the S&P 500 or rivals Chevron and Shell in that period, according to FactSet. Mr. Tillerson didn't respond to requests for comment.
In need of a chief executive who could return Exxon to its prior glory -- and who could help Exxon confront a multitude of critics and a new energy landscape -- the board turned to the 53-year-old Mr. Woods.
A tall, white-haired electrical engineer originally from Kansas, Mr. Woods came up through the ranks of Exxon's refining division, where profits come from squeezing pennies out of every barrel.
He is an enthusiastic believer in the company's traditions. In one of his first public presentations as a top executive, given in 2015 to a labor conference in the Dallas area, he repeatedly praised the company's risk and accountability methodology, known as the Operations Integrity Management System. He mentioned the wonky acronym, OIMS, 13 times in a short speech.
As he prepared to take the reins from Mr. Tillerson more than a year ago, he held a series of dinners with close advisers, according to people familiar with the meetings. At one dinner, he received a query: What if Exxon is wrong in its view of a bright future for fossil fuels? What if the greatest risk to the company is hubris?
Mr. Woods acknowledged the threat the company faces from shale drilling, electric vehicles and climate hawks, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Renewable energy opportunities weren't yet profitable enough to compete with other Exxon projects, Mr. Woods said. When they are, the company will be ready.
For now, he added, the best way forward was for Exxon to do things the Exxon way.
His faith in Exxon's process was one of the top reasons he was selected by the board to succeed Mr. Tillerson, according to people familiar with the decision.
Among the company's recent challenges: Exxon wound up miscalculating the political risks of doing business in Russia, which came under U.S. and European sanctions in 2014, and walked away earlier this year from joint ventures with state-controlled PAO Rosneft to drill for oil in the Black Sea and Arctic waters. Last year, the company was forced to acknowledge that 3.6 billion barrels of reserves in Canada -- from an oil sands project that cost more than $20 billion -- were no longer profitable to produce.
Another blunder, analysts say, was the 2010 purchase of XTO Energy Inc., one of the pioneers of modern fracking. Exxon bought the company for more than $30 billion, when natural gas prices were higher than they would be at any point over the next seven years.
In the past two years, Exxon has written down the value of its U.S. natural gas assets, which include its XTO unit, by $2.5 billion, an unusual step for the company. In 2015, Mr. Tillerson told trade publication Energy Intelligence that at Exxon, "we don't do write-downs."
Exxon's fracking prospects in the Permian basin in West Texas and New Mexico, developed by its XTO unit, remain among its most profitable opportunities, the company says. Still, its U.S. drilling business has lost money in 11 of the last 15 quarters.
Mr. Woods has taken several steps to shake up Exxon's insularity, embrace new risks and jettison less profitable areas. People familiar with the matter said Exxon is weighing reducing its exposure to Canada, where it has operated for 130 years. Getting oil from Canada's oil sands is expensive, and the prospect of reduced exposure has signaled to some advisers that the company may become more aggressive in seeking transformation.
The company is also developing a more robust trading operation with an eye toward using regional oil and gas price disparities in the U.S. and around the world to boost profits, according to people familiar with the process.
Still, the centerpiece of Mr. Woods's turnaround effort is a major increase in spending, much of which is focused on drilling in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Mozambique and Texas. In March, he said such opportunities are the best Exxon has seen since its merger with Mobil. They will make it possible for the company to produce an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day, he said. Combined with existing production, that would equate to five million daily barrels, a record for Exxon.
Next year, Exxon is set to spend $28 billion, 45% more than in 2016. That's a marked difference from rivals such as Chevron, which is holding investment levels flat this year and 18% below 2016 levels.
Shareholders haven't responded with enthusiasm. The price of crude is up about 60% in the past year, but Exxon shares are up less than 5%.
Earlier in the year, analyst Paul Sankey, then of Wolfe Research, said clients were calling for an activist investor to force the company to take more "radical action." The unrest has calmed somewhat with oil's rally, analysts say. But shareholders are still looking for big change.
"Darren Woods is turning the Exxon Mobil supertanker, but the scale of the challenge is giant," said Mr. Sankey, now an analyst at Mizuho Energy. Exxon is poised to rebound in three to five years, but other companies are better bets for now, he said.
Investors are favoring smaller, nimbler competitors. ConocoPhillips, which has seen its shares rise 60% since last year, shed a number of businesses and promised to distribute much of its excess cash to shareholders in coming years rather than reinvesting.
From January to March, EOG Resources Inc., the biggest American shale producer, reported higher per-share profits than Exxon, a company five times its size. EOG's stock is up 84% in the last five years. Exxon is down about 10% in that time.
Meanwhile, rivals such as Shell, BP and Total have diversified outside of fossil fuels.
"Through the ups and downs of oil prices, Exxon always had very high returns, but that has changed," said Jonathan Waghorn, a portfolio manager at Guinness Atkinson Management Inc. It sold out of its Exxon position last year.

Full text: Scott Pruitt wasn't chased out of the EPA because of his ethical lapses but because he was derailing the environmental left's radical effort to tighten its grip on the U.S. economy. Mr. Pruitt was implementing President Trump's executive order to scuttle Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, which would have forced sharp cutbacks in the use of fossil fuels, at great cost to consumers and with little purpose.
Under President Obama, the EPA's bureaucrats became the shock troops of a new "green revolution" -- quite different from the one that revolutionized agriculture. Mr. Trump chose Mr. Pruitt to lead the counterrevolution. Accordingly, Mr. Pruitt scotched the agency's encouragement of "sue and settle" litigation that effectively gave outside lobbyists the power to set EPA policies.
Further horror of horrors, the president pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, ending the longstanding collaboration between the EPA and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Governments throughout the world have already spent hundreds of billions of dollars to meet U.N. goals for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. Last July, Danish scholar Bjorn Lomborg predicted the cost of implementing the Paris Climate Accord would hit $2 trillion by 2030.
CO2 is a natural component of the air we breathe and without it there would be no life on earth. The U.N.'s alarms about a CO2 "greenhouse" causing global warming are based on dubious computer models. As the Cato Institute's Pat Michaels and Ryan Maue observed on this page last month, global surface temperature hasn't risen significantly since 2000.
The stakes are high. Government restrictions on carbon emissions have spawned a large renewable-energy industry specializing in solar panels and windmills. In places where those industries have best thrived, such as Germany and Australia, the result has been unreliable power at sharply higher cost. Germans pay roughly three times what Americans pay for electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.
The idea that "renewables" are some kind of modern planet-saving technology is preposterous. Other than fire, renewables were mankind's only energy sources for eons. Primitive people built their huts with solar-fired mud bricks. The 15th-century European explorers relied on the wind to fill their sails. "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" described the well-known peril of being becalmed on the vast ocean with water everywhere, "nor any drop to drink." Modern mariners, with ships driven by fossil-fueled turbines, seldom face that problem.
It's hardly a new discovery that renewables don't work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. What is less understood is that even when governments force public utilities to buy renewables, power companies still have to use fossil fuels or uranium to keep the grid up and running when the sun and wind are off duty. So renewable power is superfluous to power companies, but its cost reduces their ability to finance baseload power plants. The result is either higher electricity bills or an unreliable grid. Consumers get punished either way.
Even the Bonneville Power Administration, a grand government hydropower complex that provides the U.S. Northwest with 28% of its electricity, has been plagued with this problem as the requirement to make way for government-subsidized wind and solar reduces its ability to utilize its system efficiently. Said a BPA statement in January: "Our power customers have expressed serious concerns that BPA's recent pattern of rising costs and rates is unsustainable."
Matters are even worse in some of the countries where parties of the environmentalist left have been more successful. At the behest of its Greens, Germany shut down not only coal plants but also some nuclear facilities after the meltdown at the badly designed Fukushima plant in Japan. High electricity costs were an important factor, along with the refugee influx, in Chancellor Angela Merkel's election debacle last year.
Australia's left used to boast that their nation had more solar panels per capita than anywhere else in the world. They said less about Australia's household electricity costs -- also among the world's highest. When South Australia suffered blackouts in the summer of 2006, politicians began to realize something was amiss. Last October, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull scrapped plans to set new renewables targets, and his government expects to have a new, more reliable, energy plan by next month. It may include such irreligious means as renewed use of the country's plentiful coal deposits.
Mr. Trump dumped the Paris Agreement to stop the U.S. from going the way of Germany and Australia. Mr. Obama had drunk the U.N. Kool-Aid, echoing the claim that global warming was an existential threat to the planet. His 2015 Clean Power Plan was designed to reduce CO2 emissions from the electric-power sector by 32% from 2005 levels by 2030, notably through greater dependence on wind and solar.
When Mr. Obama launched the CPP (sans congressional legislation) it drew challenges from 150 entities, including 27 states, 24 trade associations, 37 rural electrical cooperatives and three labor unions, the EPA reported. Taking those complaints seriously, the Trump administration moved to scrap the plan. This will save up to $33 billion in compliance costs by 2030, according to a new EPA estimate.
Mr. Pruitt's successor at the EPA, acting director Andrew Wheeler, will now take the sniper fire. But consider this: Enviro-shaman Al Gore warned in "Earth in the Balance" that the planet was in imminent peril from global warming fully 26 years ago. Yet temperature readings from weather stations and satellites today show that the earth's sundry climates are pretty much what they were then. Hyderabad still gets very hot in summer, as it has for centuries, and Yakutsk gets very cold in winter, ditto. San Francisco is pretty nice year-round, except for the fog and the politics.

Full text: The new acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is a former coal and energy lobbyist who has expressed skepticism about the human impact on climate change.
President Donald Trump on Thursday named Andrew Wheeler as acting administrator after accepting the resignation of Scott Pruitt, who left amid a series of allegations over ethics and spending.
"I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda," Mr. Trump tweeted.
Mr. Wheeler's elevation from deputy administrator, which was sharply criticized by environmental groups, isn't likely to bring big changes in policy at the EPA. Mr. Pruitt sought to roll back a number of Obama-eraregulations, including water and air rules that affect energy producers, farmers and auto makers, among many others.
Mr. Pruitt also worked to reduce the agency's oversight powers, including removing its ability to blockpermits issued to mining, real estate and other developers to dump waste into waterways.
Federal lobbying records show Mr. Wheeler has represented a number of energy companies, including Xcel Energy Inc., Energy Fuels Resources Inc. and Murray Energy Corp., a coal producer that waged many legal battles against the EPA under former President Barack Obama. The company's CEO, Bob Murray, was a top backer of Mr. Trump during the 2016 election.
Mr. Wheeler filed his last lobbying disclosures in the summer of 2017, about two months before he was appointed deputy EPA administrator in October of that year. Among the government entities Mr. Wheeler lobbied: the EPA.
Previously, Mr. Wheeler served as a top adviser to Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.), who then headed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. In that role, Mr. Wheeler worked on energy legislation and Clean Air Act issues.
Mr. Wheeler is one of a handful of potential or current Trump administration officials with connections to Mr. Inhofe, Washington's most outspoken skeptic of the scientific consensus that human activity is a driving cause of climate change. Mr. Inhofe once threw a snowball on the Senate floor to illustrate his skepticism about climate change.
Mr. Wheeler, asked at his confirmation hearing about the relationship between human activity and temperature changes on the planet, said: "I believe man has an impact on the climate but what is not completely understood is what the impact is."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Scott Pruitt, the embattled administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, resigned Thursday after allegations of ethical lapses and improper spending overshadowed his aggressive campaign to roll back Obama-era environmental rules.
President Donald Trump, who announced Mr. Pruitt's departure in a tweet, said Mr. Pruitt's deputy, Andrew Wheeler, would become acting EPA administrator on Monday.
A former lobbyist for the coal industry, Mr. Wheeler is expected to continue Mr. Pruitt's push to position the EPA as an agency that avoids stifling business investment or opportunity while seeking to protect the environment and enforce environmental laws, after years in which many Republicans complained the agency overreached in its regulations.
Mr. Pruitt had become a lightning rod for administration critics, fueled not only by his approach to environmental policy, but also a string of controversies involving his travel, potential employment for his wife, his living arrangements in Washington and spending at the agency.
"I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this," Mr. Trump tweeted.
The president stood by Mr. Pruitt for months, despite the growing ethical allegations raised by both Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Trump, a Republican, frequently cited the EPA chief's success in rolling back regulations advanced by Mr. Trump's Democratic predecessor. Mr. Pruitt withdrew an Obama-era rule requiring reduced carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants and was considered instrumental in persuading Mr. Trump to pull out of the Paris climate accord.
Mr. Pruitt also pushed to sharply reduce the EPA's oversight powers. Last month, he moved to limit the agency's ability to block permits issued to mining, real-estate and other developers to dump waste into waterways.
Mr. Trump said Thursday that Mr. Pruitt had done an "outstanding job inside of the EPA" but acknowledged "obviously, the controversies." The president said in his view there had been "no final straw" and that Mr. Pruitt had decided over the last couple of days that "he was a distraction."
As recently as Wednesday, Mr. Pruitt attended a picnic on the White House lawn for military families, along with several other cabinet members, and was recognized by Mr. Trump in his prepared remarks.
An EPA spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, confirmed Thursday that Mr. Pruitt had submitted a letter of resignation to Mr. Trump.
In the letter, Mr. Pruitt wrote that it was "extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring. However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us."
Mr. Pruitt's work earned him a reputation as one of the most loyal cabinet members and one of the most effective at executing Trump administration philosophy. Mr. Trump in the past referred to him privately as "my lawyer," one White House official said.
But White House officials expressed increasing misgiving about the scandals surrounding the former Oklahoma attorney general. And he alienated some in the administration by making known his desire to succeed Jeff Sessions as attorney general, should Mr. Sessions step down or be fired, according to a White House official.
Mr. Pruitt's exit is the latest high-level departure from the administration. In the past year, the president ousted two cabinet secretaries, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Veterans Affairs chief David Shulkin, and accepted the resignation of a third, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. He also removed H.R. McMaster as national security adviser.
Earlier this week, a former staffer said Mr. Pruitt and his staff omitted, altered or removed from his official calendar potentially controversial meetings and phone calls, some with industry executives. Such changes could be considered an illegal falsification of government records.
In mid-June, the federal government's ethics watchdog pushed the EPA's in-house investigators to expand and accelerate their inquiry into allegations against Mr. Pruitt, to include additional claims about Mr. Pruitt's use of subordinates' time to complete personal errands for him, as well as to seek business opportunities for his wife, including as a Chick-fil-A franchisee.
The EPA inspector general was already reviewing allegations against Mr. Pruitt including those involving travel practices and security costs, personnel moves at the agency and how he obtained rental housing connected to a Washington lobbyist.
Several House and Senate committees had also been investigating Mr. Pruitt's conduct, including taking extensive testimony from current and former aides. Democratic lawmakers who had been pushing for Mr. Pruitt's departure were swift, and blunt, in their reaction Thursday. "It's about time," Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio) said.
Sen. Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.), a longtime ally of Mr. Pruitt's, praised Mr. Pruitt's work at the agency but said that Mr. Wheeler had worked for him for 14 years and had "an impeccable reputation" and would be a "strong leader" at the agency.
Mr. Pruitt rose to national prominence years before he joined the Trump administration. After becoming Oklahoma's attorney general in 2011, he led a coalition of conservative states in lawsuits against the federal government.
The coalition won major victories challenging some Obama administration policies all the way to the Supreme Court. His suits changed how former President Barack Obama's health-care overhaul works, and he won a stay that put Mr. Obama's signature climate-change policy, the Clean Power Plan, on hold.
That made him a darling of conservative groups, some energy companies and some prominent Republican boosters.
A former state legislator and owner of a minor-league baseball team, Mr. Pruitt was considered a climate-change skeptic. He has since said he accepts that climate change is happening, but questions how severe it might be and government's role in fighting it.
Mr. Pruitt's policies made him a target for environmental groups and liberals before he took office, but criticism grew over how he ran the agency and spent money.

Justice Department
Says It Met Requests
The Justice Department told the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee that it had complied with his requests to the extent legally permissible, pushing back against his deadline for more documents related to the FBI's investigation of President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.
In a letter to Rep. Devin Nunes, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that the department's efforts to accommodate the committee's demands while protecting ongoing investigations were "consistent with the law."
"Your letter asks whether the Department and the FBI 'intend to obey' the law," he wrote. "We believe that is exactly what the Department and the FBI have been doing."
The letter came ahead of a 5 p.m. Monday deadline that Mr. Nunes (R., Calif.), set for the Justice Department to turn over information pertaining to the early stages of the FBI's Russia investigation, including the bureau's use of confidential informants.
A spokesman for Mr. Nunes didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Lawsuits Dismissed
Against Oil Companies
A federal judge dismissed lawsuits by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland alleging that five of the world's largest oil companies should pay to protect the cities' residents from the impacts of climate change.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup on Monday granted a motion by the companies -- BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corp. -- to dismiss the suits, ruling that while global warming was a real threat, it must be fixed "by our political branches."
The ruling is a blow to an emerging legal campaign by cities that are trying to argue that oil and gas companies created a public nuisance by producing fossil fuels they knew would result in harmful emissions.
New York City and several other local governments in California, Washington and Colorado have also sued on similar grounds.
The suits by San Francisco and Oakland sought to force the companies to pay for infrastructure, such as sea walls, that they expect to need due to rising sea levels and other changes linked to a changing climate.

Full text: Corrections & Amplifications
The Environmental Defense Fund never opposed genetically modified organisms. It recently publicly stated for the first time that it "recognizes the use of biotechnology as a legitimate deployment of science in the search for effective solutions." A June 23 Review essay about GMOs incorrectly said the organization has opposed GMOs in the past and recently reversed its position.
(WSJ July 12, 2018)
[Genetically modified crops have been vilified and banned, but the science is clear: They're perfectly safe. And what's more, the world desperately needs them.]
In a now-famous segment of his talk show, Jimmy Kimmel sent a reporter out to a West Coast farmers market in 2014 to ask food-conscious shoppers what they thought of GMOs. All the interviewees declared their horrified avoidance of GMOs -- and then, predictably, failed to come up with an explanation for what the letters "G.M.O." stand for.
The answer, of course, is "genetically modified organism." First launched commercially on a wide scale in U.S. agriculture in 1996, GMOs are typically plants or animals whose genomes have been modified by the addition of one or more genes from another species. From the outset they were met with controversy and resistance, dubbed "Frankenfoods" and subject to boycotts and protests that continue to this day in many countries.
Opposition was largely inspired and led by environmentalists, who asserted that genetically modified crops and foods would cause a range of harms. They argued that GMOs would damage the environment, because some were bred to withstand weed killers, which would then be used to excess.
They claimed that GMOs were especially bad for the developing world, tying farmers to expensive new seeds that would not reproduce, thus destroying traditional agriculture. Some campaigners dubbed GMOs "suicide seeds," pointing to cases of farmers in India who, trapped in debt, took their own lives. Perhaps most crucially, many opponents claimed that genetically modified foods were a threat to human health, causing a higher incidence of everything from cancer and autism to diabetes and obesity.
This wide-ranging indictment took its toll. In a matter of years, the main developer and proponent of GMO seeds, the Missouri-based agrochemical and biotech company Monsanto, became a byword for corporate evil in much of the world.
I am a science writer by profession, and I know these arguments well because, in those early years of GMO development, I was also an outspoken activist against the new technology. Along with green-minded British colleagues, I trespassed to destroy test fields of GMO crops, lobbied to have foods containing genetically modified ingredients banned in supermarkets, helped to organize the world's first campaign targeting Monsanto, and even participated in an unsuccessful attempt to steal the world's first cloned farm animal, Dolly the Sheep.
I have since reversed my views on GMOs, as the evidence debunking almost all of these claims has accumulated over the years, but there's no denying the remarkable world-wide success of our campaign.
Numerous countries, from Peru to Russia, now entirely ban genetically modified crops from being cultivated. Only one GMO food crop, an insect-resistant corn, has ever been approved for use in Europe, and most European countries ban it anyway. Only a handful of African countries permit any GMOs at all. China and India allow their farmers to grow genetically modified cotton but little else.
Early research on genetically engineered wheat, potato and rice was shelved due to worries from food processors and retailers, and strict regulations were introduced making it extremely difficult and expensive to get genetically engineered crops approved anywhere in the world.
In the U.S., the anti-GMO movement initially saw only a limited impact as farmers rapidly and overwhelmingly adopted genetically modified soy, corn and cotton. More recently, laws passed in several states and by Congress have mandated labeling for GMO foods. Though transparency in these matters is a good thing, it is often paired with campaigns of disinformation against GMOs, such as the claim that they might transfer allergenic proteins (they don't). Meanwhile, the voluntary butterfly emblem of the Non-GMO Project has proliferated on products across grocery shelves, proudly displayed as a banner of supposed purity.
The problem isn't just that almost all of the alarms about GMOs were false. It's that the anti-GMO campaign has deprived much of the world of a crucial, life-improving technology -- and has shown the readiness of many environmentalists to ignore science when it contradicts their prejudices. That's not the example we need just now as the planet faces the very real threat of climate change.
Contrary to our initial fears, the overall impact of genetically modified crops has been to dramatically reduce the amount and toxicity of pesticides sprayed by farmers. Crops such as Bt corn, so called because it incorporates proteins toxic to insects from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, have enabled farmers to rely less on sprayed insecticides. A meta-analysis, combining the results of nearly 150 peer-reviewed studies, was published in 2014 in the highly regarded journal PLOS One. It concluded that GMO crops used 37% less chemical pesticide (that is, both insecticide and herbicide) than conventional versions of the same crops, thanks largely to the new crops' internal biological protection against insects.
Pesticide reductions have been especially notable in developing countries. In Bangladesh, for instance, I have seen firsthand how smallholder farmers have benefited from Bt varieties of eggplant. In the past, they often sprayed their crop with toxic chemicals as many as 100 times in a season to fight off pests. The GMO eggplant has enabled them to dramatically reduce insecticide spraying, in some places almost to zero.
And the GMO seeds reproduce perfectly well. Those Bangladeshi farmers save and share their new Bt eggplant seeds, helping their neighbors and extended families also to reduce pesticide spraying. Many crops now in development in African countries, such as drought-tolerant corn and disease-resistant banana and cassava, will be sold royalty-free by local seed companies in an effort to improve the livelihoods of subsistence farmers and reduce poverty.
Nor is there any truth to the charge that GMO crops have driven Indian farmers to suicide. The Bt cotton introduced to India in 2002 has turned out to be a boon. It now accounts for over 90% of Indian cotton acreage, with 800 different competing Bt cotton varieties on the domestic market. Farmer suicide in India, while undoubtedly tragic in each individual case, occurs at a rate similar to that of such countries as Scotland or France, which don't use GMOs. The German researcher Matin Qaim estimates that the reduced use of insecticides by Indian farmers, thanks to GMO cotton, may have avoided as many as 2.4 million cases of poisoning a year.
Perhaps the most egregious and now-exploded myth is that GMO foods are somehow bad for human health. Doctored graphs showing purported correlations between rates of autism and GMO crop adoption, or suggested links between genetic engineering and cancer rates, have become widespread internet memes. A 2015 study by the Pew Research Center found that only 37% of U.S. adults in the general public believe that it is safe to eat genetically modified foods, as compared with 88% of American scientists.
The reason for this gap is clear enough: Anti-GMO activists have peddled a great deal of misinformation to the general public, while the scientific community, in the U.S. and elsewhere, has known for years that there is no basis for the health concerns that have long bedeviled GMOs.
A massive 2016 report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences concluded that "the data do not support the assertion that cancer rates have increased because of consumption of products of [genetically engineered] crops." Moreover, "patterns of change in cancer incidence in the U.S. are generally similar to those in the United Kingdom and Europe, where diets contain much lower amounts of food derived from [these] crops." The NAS reached the same conclusion for obesity, diabetes, celiac disease, various allergies and autism, pointing to no evidence of higher rates in countries that use GMOs.
The view that GMO foods have no discernible impact on health is now the well-established consensus across the international scientific community. It includes not just the NAS but the American Medical Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the U.K.'s Royal Society, the French Academy of Science, the African Academy of Sciences and numerous others.
Even the usually GMO-skeptic European Commission admitted in a 2010 report: "The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than . . . conventional plant breeding technologies."
Particularly striking to me was the strongly worded statement issued in 2012 by the board of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It declared, "The science is quite clear: Crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe." This language was almost identical in form to the 2007 statement by the AAAS on climate change, which stated: "The scientific evidence is clear: Global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society."
Indeed, it was this issue that forced me to publicly change my mind on GMOs. After my years of anti-GMO activism in the late 1990s, I moved on to write books on the topic of climate change, and I put a great deal of effort into trying to get the science right. I spent years poring through peer-reviewed journals and debating the issue in the media, insisting that the scientific consensus on climate change should be taken seriously.
But how could I so forcefully endorse the scientific consensus on climate change while simultaneously denying the scientific consensus on GMOs? I came to see that my refusal to accept the science on GMOs put me on the same side, ironically, as those I would contemptuously term "deniers" for their refusal to accept the mainstream scientific view on human-caused climate change.
There are now encouraging signs that the more science-friendly environmental groups are recognizing this contradiction and beginning to shift their positions. Recently, the Environmental Defense Fund posted its view on biotechnology after lengthy internal debate. EDF, to its credit, now "recognizes the use of biotechnology as a legitimate deployment of science in the search for effective solutions."
I have often been attacked, especially by my onetime activist friends, for changing my mind on GMOs. But what was the alternative? To stick to a position that I knew to be false in order to avoid losing reputation? Environmentalism, perhaps more than any other philosophy, requires science. And science means that you must change your mind when the evidence changes, however inconvenient that might be.
So what is it about GMOs that made environmentalists so wary in the first place? The real objection, I suspect, has always been a deeper philosophical one, about human beings "messing with nature" in new and uncertain ways. The idea of technological hubris has long been a concern of the Green movement, also evident in the longstanding and equally misguided campaign against nuclear power.
These reflexes explain why environmentalism is often not the progressive force that it claims to be. Holding a progressive worldview means believing in the possibility of positive change, recognizing past improvements and seeing the potential of scientific and technological innovation to solve humanity's most pressing problems. In their campaign against GMOs, environmentalists have flirted with reactionary politics, aiming to block innovation and to protect traditional agricultural methods in the service of often-romanticized notions of vanished rural idylls.
The coming world of 10 billion people demands a more clear-headed and genuinely progressive approach. The great challenge will be to produce enough food for this tremendous surge in population while also protecting enough wilderness areas to maintain some measure of the planet's fast-depleting biodiversity. We simply cannot feed the high-consuming population of the future using the low-productivity methods of the past.
Science has already helped humanity to nearly abolish the specter of famine. If it is not to reappear in decades to come, in tandem with ecological collapse, we must allow scientists to keep doing their jobs. They shouldn't be hindered by those who, having already filled their bellies, have the luxury to indulge in righteous, ill-informed campaigns against promising new food technologies.

Judge Rules Against
Bureau's Structure
A federal judge in New York ruled Thursday that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unconstitutional, diverging from an appeals-court decision in January that affirmed its composition.
The judge, dealing a blow to advocates of a strong and independent CFPB, removed the bureau as a plaintiff in a case involving an alleged scheme to defraud 9/11 first responders with illnesses and football players with brain injuries out of their financial payouts.
The case was brought by the CFPB and the New York attorney general's office against New Jersey lender RD Legal Funding LLC and its owner, which provided costly advances on settlement payouts from victims' compensation funds.
"[B]ecause the CFPB's structure is unconstitutional, it lacks the authority to bring claims under the [Consumer Financial Protection Act] and is hereby terminated as a party to this action," Judge Loretta Preska wrote in her decision.
The judge denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, saying the New York attorney general had the authority to bring the claims. A CFPB spokesman declined to comment.

ENVIRONMENT
Study Finds Higher
Methane Emissions
The country's natural-gas boom is putting much higher rates of the potent greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere than government estimates suggest, a challenge for efforts to slow global warming, according to an analysis published Thursday in the journal Science.
Methane leaks are a crucial element of the country's gas boom because raw emissions can cancel out gains made by lowering carbon emissions created by burning other fuels. The new report suggests using more gas does have major benefits at limiting climate change over 100 years, but may not help in the short term.
That is because leaks and unplanned plumes vented from storage tanks and processing plants are likely larger than previously realized. They appear big enough to make a shift from coal to gas effectively meaningless over a 20-year time span, the study found.
The assessment estimates the U.S. energy industry is leaking about 2.3% of all the gas it produces directly into the atmosphere, meaning that enough greenhouse gasses are coming from the gas industry to equal roughly the 20-year climate impact from all the coal-fired power plants running nationwide in 2015.

Full text: As several cities continue their suit against oil companies, The People of the State of California v. BP, Judge William Alsup has boiled the case down to its pivotal question. In March he ordered the legal counsels of both parties to help him weigh "the large benefits that have flowed from the use of fossil fuels" against the possibility that such fuels may be causing global warming.
We sent the judge, and posted online, a 24-page document that answers his question. The benefits of oil, coal and gas are rarely acknowledged by environmental activists, who seek to regulate and tax these fuel sources out of existence. But an honest accounting shows that fossil fuels produce enormous social value that far outweighs their costs.
First, fossil fuels are lifting billions of people out of poverty, and in turn improving health. "The most fundamental attribute of modern society is simply this," writes historian Vaclav Smil in his 2003 book on energy: "Ours is a high energy civilization based largely on combustion of fossil fuels."
Fossil fuels, and coal in particular, provided the energy that powered the Industrial Revolution. Today, coal plants still produce most of the electricity that powers high-tech manufacturing equipment and charges mobile computing devices.
The alternative energy sources environmental activists favor are generally more expensive. Energy economists Thomas Stacey and George Taylor calculate that wind power costs nearly three times as much as existing coal generation and 2.3 times as much as combined-cycle gas. There is a negative correlation between energy prices and economic activity. A 2014 survey of economic literature by Roger Bezdek calculates that a 10% increase in U.S. electricity prices would eliminate approximately 1.3% of gross domestic product.
Cheap energy from fossil fuels also improves human well-being by powering labor-saving and life-protecting technologies, such as air-conditioning, modern medicine, and cars and trucks. Environmental activists often claim that prosperity speeds the depletion of resources and destruction of nature, but the opposite is true. As Ronald Bailey writes in "The End of Doom": "It is in rich democratic capitalist countries that the air and water are becoming cleaner, forests are expanding, food is abundant, education is universal, and women's rights respected."
Fossil fuels have increased the quantity of food humans produce and improved the reliability of the food supply. The availability of cheap energy revolutionized agriculture throughout the world, making it possible for an ever-smaller proportion of the labor force to raise food sufficient to feed a growing global population without devastating nature or polluting air or water.
Fossil-fuel emissions create additional benefits, contributing to the greening of the Earth. A 2017 study published in Nature magazine found that the global mass of land plants grew 31% during the 20th century. African deserts are blooming thanks to fossil fuels.
Finally, if fossil fuels are responsible for a significant part of the warming recorded during the second half of the 20th century, then they should also be credited with reducing deaths due to cold weather. Medical researchers William Richard Keatinge and Gavin Donaldson assessed this effect in a 2004 study. "Since heat-related deaths are generally much fewer than cold-related deaths, the overall effect of global warming on health can be expected to be a beneficial one."
They estimate the predicted temperature rise in Britain over the next 50 years will reduce cold-related deaths by 10 times the number of increased heat-related deaths. Other research shows climate change has exerted only a minimal influence on recent trends in vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and diseases spread by ticks.
Altogether, fossil fuels have produced huge benefits for mankind, many of which continue today. But advocates of alternative energy sources usually manage to omit or diminish many of these benefits when calculating fossil fuels' "social cost."
Thankfully, President Trump and congressional Republicans understand that the costs of fossil fuels must be weighed against their substantial benefits. They have decided wisely not to carry on the "war on fossil fuels" waged by the Obama administration, congressional Democrats and their Golden State allies.

Full text: Lawyers for five major oil companies asked a federal judge Wednesday to dismiss a lawsuit filed by New York City, arguing they shouldn't be held responsible for damages the city says are caused by climate change.
In January, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, sued five companies -- Chevron Corp., BP PLC, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and Exxon Mobil Corp. -- arguing they knowingly produced fossil fuels that hurt the environment and misled the public about potential risks.
The city isn't asking the companies to change their behavior. Instead, it is seeking billions of dollars in damages it says it needs to protect New Yorkers from rising sea levels, erosion and other conditions it says are caused by climate change.
In Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, Chevron attorney Theodore Boutrous Jr. said the companies did nothing illegal. He said questions raised by the lawsuit are ones for Congress and regulators, not a judge in New York.
"These cases don't belong in court," Mr. Boutrous said.
ConocoPhillips lawyer John Savarese said it is impossible to prove oil companies are the only cause of climate change. While the companies produce fossil fuels, he said, they don't control how millions of people and businesses use their products.
Matthew Pawa, a lawyer for the city, said the lawsuit isn't about fossil-fuel emissions dating back to the dawn of the Industrial Era. Rather, he said, the companies produced and sold a product they knew would hurt the environment, including coastal cities like New York. "They knowingly caused harm," he added.
Judge John Keenan asked Mr. Pawa whether pinning responsibility for fossil fuels' negative environmental consequences would require "complex policy and foreign-policy judgments." Judge Keenan also asked if New York City uses fossil fuels. He then asked, "Doesn't the city invest in some of these companies?"
Mr. Pawa opted out of responding to the questions. In January, Mr. de Blasio and city Comptroller Scott Stringer said they would seek to divest city pension funds from fossil-fuel companies within five years.
Judge Keenan didn't say when he would rule.

Full text: Pope Francis warned against the "continued search" for fossil fuels Saturday and urged a gathering of oil executives, investors and officials to meet the world's energy needs while protecting the environment and the poor.
"Civilization requires energy, but energy use must not destroy civilization!" he said at a Vatican climate change conference attended by top executives including Exxon Mobil Corp.Chief Executive Darren Woods, BP PLC Chief Executive Bob Dudley and BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Laurence Fink.
Environmental protection has been a signature theme for Pope Francis, who has said he took the name of St. Francis of Assisi in part because of the medieval saint's love for the natural world.
At the conference, co-sponsored by the University of Notre Dame and featuring nearly 20 speakers Friday and Saturday, the pope said that an estimated 1 billion people still lack electricity and noted that access to energy is an essential resource for escaping poverty.
But he warned that a failure to reduce the use of fossil fuels would lead to a "spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty."
The poor "suffer most from the ravages of global warming," he said, through water shortages and extreme weather which in turn drive mass migration, among other ways.
Pope Francis commended oil-and-gas companies for adopting policies that account for "assessment of climate risk" and he encouraged the practice of environmentally sensitive "green finance" investment strategies. But he warned that "markets and technology" wouldn't be sufficient to stop climate change, since our "current economic system thrives on ever-increasing extraction, consumption and waste."
He lamented the "continued search for fossil fuel reserves" despite the 2015 Paris Agreement, which "clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground."

Full text: Exxon Mobil Corp., the oil giant long derided by environmentalists, is trying to give itself a green facelift.
Chief Executive Darren Woods has called for Exxon to become "part of the solution" on climate change, a point he was expected to make Saturday as he and other oil and gas executives meet with Pope Francis at the Vatican to discuss the issue.
The company has flooded the airwaves during the NBA playoffs with advertisements touting its research into fuels made from algae. It pledged last month to cut its methane emissions 15% by 2020. Exxon is now calling for global action to address climate change, and it has begun publicly promoting a U.S. carbon tax.
It is part of an evolving shift by Exxon under Mr. Woods, after some of his predecessors adopted a more adversarial stance on climate and environmental issues with governments and activists. The oil giant faces investor pressure to disclose the potential impacts of climate regulations on its business, as well as lawsuits by New York and others alleging Exxon foresaw the consequences of rising temperatures -- public battles that have forced the company to defend its reputation.
Exxon faces many challenges as it seeks to shift the narrative on its climate record. For one, it isn't really changing its business model.
While peers such as BP PLC and Total SA are investing in renewables and diversifying into other energy businesses, Exxon remains almost entirely focused on oil and gas. Its research projects are oriented toward mitigating the impact of fossil fuels, and may take years to gain traction.
"Exxon is taking a very narrow path on its green makeover relative to other companies," said Peter Bryant, managing partner at consulting firm Clareo. "They aren't building energy optionality."
The company's research aim is to find technological breakthroughs that will help meet the world's growing energy needs and reduce emissions. Exxon executives don't see traditional renewables investments as having that kind of potential.
"We see our role as helping close the gap between what people want and what can be responsibly done," Mr. Woods told investors at Exxon's annual meeting late last month.
The new public posture has been years in the making, but it represents a significant about-face for Exxon, which in 2000 ran a newspaper ad questioning the "unsettled science" on global warming, and whose pugnacious former chief executive, Lee Raymond, spoke out in 1997 against the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to set global emission-reduction targets.
The evolution of Exxon's climate stance began under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who preceded Mr. Woods as CEO. Mr. Tillerson supported a carbon tax in theory, though he was less proactive in positioning the company to provide climate solutions.
So far, Exxon's technology investments are largely wagers on the future of fossil fuels. For example, for algae-made fuel to ever be used in cars or trucks, the internal combustion engine must continue to hold sway in the market. The need for algae-related biofuels to be processed also could theoretically preserve some of the value of Exxon's refineries, experts say.

Full text: Climate change is over. No, I'm not saying the climate will not change in the future, or that human influence on the climate is negligible. I mean simply that climate change is no longer a pre-eminent policy issue. All that remains is boilerplate rhetoric from the political class, frivolous nuisance lawsuits, and bureaucratic mandates on behalf of special-interest renewable-energy rent seekers.
Judged by deeds rather than words, most national governments are backing away from forced-marched decarbonization. You can date the arc of climate change as a policy priority from 1988, when highly publicized congressional hearings first elevated the issue, to 2018. President Trump's ostentatious withdrawal from the Paris Agreement merely ratified a trend long becoming evident.
A good indicator of why climate change as an issue is over can be found early in the text of the Paris Agreement. The "nonbinding" pact declares that climate action must include concern for "gender equality, empowerment of women, and intergenerational equity" as well as "the importance for some of the concept of 'climate justice.'" Another is Sarah Myhre's address at the most recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union, in which she proclaimed that climate change cannot fully be addressed without also grappling with the misogyny and social injustice that have perpetuated the problem for decades.
The descent of climate change into the abyss of social-justice identity politics represents the last gasp of a cause that has lost its vitality. Climate alarm is like a car alarm -- a blaring noise people are tuning out.
This outcome was predictable. Political scientist Anthony Downs described the downward trajectory of many political movements in an article for the Public Interest, "Up and Down With Ecology: The 'Issue-Attention Cycle,'" published in 1972, long before the climate-change campaign began. Observing the movements that had arisen to address issues like crime, poverty and even the U.S.-Soviet space race, Mr. Downs discerned a five-stage cycle through which political issues pass regularly.
The first stage involves groups of experts and activists calling attention to a public problem, which leads quickly to the second stage, wherein the alarmed media and political class discover the issue. The second stage typically includes a large amount of euphoric enthusiasm -- you might call it the "dopamine" stage -- as activists conceive the issue in terms of global peril and salvation. This tendency explains the fanaticism with which divinity-school dropouts Al Gore and Jerry Brown have warned of climate change.
Then comes the third stage: the hinge. As Mr. Downs explains, there soon comes "a gradually spreading realization that the cost of 'solving' the problem is very high indeed." That's where we've been since the United Nations' traveling climate circus committed itself to the fanatical mission of massive near-term reductions in fossil fuel consumption, codified in unrealistic proposals like the Kyoto Protocol. This third stage, Mr. Downs continues, "becomes almost imperceptibly transformed into the fourth stage: a gradual decline in the intensity of public interest in the problem."
While opinion surveys find that roughly half of Americans regard climate change as a problem, the issue has never achieved high salience among the public, despite the drumbeat of alarm from the climate campaign. Americans have consistently ranked climate change the 19th or 20th of 20 leading issues on the annual Pew Research Center poll, while Gallup's yearly survey of environmental issues typically ranks climate change far behind air and water pollution.
"In the final stage," Mr. Downs concludes, "an issue that has been replaced at the center of public concern moves into a prolonged limbo -- a twilight realm of lesser attention or spasmodic recurrences of interest." Mr. Downs predicted correctly that environmental issues would suffer this decline, because solving such issues involves painful trade-offs that committed climate activists would rather not make.
A case in point is climate campaigners' push for clean energy, whereas they write off nuclear power because it doesn't fit their green utopian vision. A new study of climate-related philanthropy by Matthew Nisbet found that of the $556.7 million green-leaning foundations spent from 2011-15, "not a single grant supported work on promoting or reducing the cost of nuclear energy." The major emphasis of green giving was "devoted to mobilizing public opinion and to opposing the fossil fuel industry."
Scientists who are genuinely worried about the potential for catastrophic climate change ought to be the most outraged at how the left politicized the issue and how the international policy community narrowed the range of acceptable responses. Treating climate change as a planet-scale problem that could be solved only by an international regulatory scheme transformed the issue into a political creed for committed believers. Causes that live by politics, die by politics.

Full text: Would the Journal run the op-ed "Objects Are Falling, but Not Because of Gravity"? That's pretty similar to climate contrarian Fred Singer saying The Sea Is Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change" (op-ed, May 16).
No, ice is not accumulating on Earth -- it is melting. No, Antarctica isn't too cold for melting -- warming oceans are eroding the ice from beneath, destabilizing the ice sheet. And no, legitimate scientific conclusions are not reached in op-ed pieces, but through careful peer-reviewed research.
That research shows that sea levels are rising and human-caused climate change is the cause. Don't take our word for it; help yourself to the mountain of scientific literature showing as much. When water warms, it expands. When ice warms, it melts. To deny these facts is not just to deny climate change. It is to deny basic physics.
New York City experienced an additional 25 square miles of flooding from the approximately one foot of sea-level rise that has occurred due to human-caused warming. Without concerted efforts to reduce carbon emissions, it could experience as much as eight feet by the end of the century -- permanently inundating most of Wall Street.

Our emissions will continue shaping how much seas rise in the coming decades. Taking this threat lightly endangers hundreds of communities in the U.S. and world-wide, and wastes the dwindling time we have to reduce our risk by cutting carbon emissions and investing in resilience. Since 1900, global sea level has risen by seven to eight inches. Sea-level rise has brought more frequent flooding to dozens of coastal communities, including Atlantic City, N.J. and Charleston, S.C., where the number of floods has quadrupled since 1970. The pace of sea-level rise has recently doubled.
Mr. Singer acknowledges there's "good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate," yet makes the unscientific claim that this is disconnected from rising global-warming emissions and temperatures. The risks are clear. Sea-level rise projections for 2100 range from one foot to more than eight feet -- far greater than the six inches Mr. Singer claims. Swiftly reducing our global-warming emissions would give us the best chance to minimize sea-level rise, but our current emissions trajectory makes achieving the range's low end more unlikely each day.

NASA disagrees with Prof. Singer. A Feb. 13 paper notes: "Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere increase the temperature of air and water, which causes sea level to rise in two ways. First, warmer water expands, and this 'thermal expansion' of the ocean has contributed about half of the 2.8 inches (7 centimeters) of global mean sea-level rise we've seen over the last 25 years . . . Second, melting land ice flows into the ocean, also increasing sea level across the globe."

Melting ice is not the only thing that can raise the sea level. Note the eruption of hundreds of undersea volcanoes in the oceans and what they deposit. All of the rivers of the world flush millions of acre feet of mud and silt into the sea floor daily. During an undersea earthquake a tectonic plate could override another, affecting a thousand miles of sea floor, displacing a great deal of water and raising the sea level.

Full text: Investors are upping the ante on big oil companies over climate change, demanding they take more concrete action to help curb global warming.
The issue was set to come into focus at Royal Dutch Shell PLC's annual meeting Tuesday, where investors with nearly $8 trillion under management were expected to call on the company to go beyond already ambitious plans to curb emissions, according to a copy of the statement seen by The Wall Street Journal.
The statement stops short of throwing full support behind a shareholder resolution that would require the company to set targets aligned with international efforts to limit climate change, but signals strong support among investors for further measures.
The demands represent a shift in approach from investors, who have until now largely focused on requesting more transparency around climate risk.
Pressure on big oil companies over climate change has been rising since the signing of the 2015 Paris accord, under which nearly 200 nations agreed to limit average global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels. The Trump administration has vowed to pull out of the pact.
Last year, the world's largest money manager, BlackRock Inc., supported a shareholder revolt at Exxon Mobil Corp. that called for more climate disclosure. Since then, investors with roughly $30 trillion in assets under management have signed on to a five-year effort to reduce emissions and improve transparency and governance around climate at the world's biggest corporate polluters.
Last week, investors with more than $10 trillion under management sent an open letter to the oil industry calling for more action on climate.
"We want action," said Helena Vines Fiestas, head of sustainability research and policy at BNP Paribas Asset Management, which signed the letter published in the Financial Times last week.
Investor efforts are already driving change. Shell has said it wants to halve its carbon footprint -- including emissions caused by drivers who burn Shell fuel -- by 2050.
With Tuesday's statement, the signatories are prodding Shell to translate that ambition into "firm medium and short term targets," according to the copy seen by the Journal.
Some shareholders have also thrown their support behind a resolution -- subject to an investor vote at the meeting Tuesday -- that would require Shell to set targets. The proposal was made by Follow This, a Dutch activist shareholder group focused on pushing Shell to become a sustainable energy company.
A similar resolution from the same group last year gained support from only 6% of voting shareholders, but helped push Shell to include third-party emissions in carbon-reduction plans -- an unprecedented move in the industry.
Shell has urged investors to vote against this year's resolution on the grounds that targets are too rigid and that the company has already set more ambitious goals.

Full text: PARAGOMINAS, Brazil -- When Mauro Lucio Costa began rearing cattle in the 1980s in the Amazon, he took to the forest like everyone else: with a chain saw and a match.
Ranchers like him eventually cleared an area as large as California from the world's largest rain forest.
Mr. Costa broke ranks in 2002 and started employing more sustainable techniques, such as fertilizing grass, using feedlots and rotating herds. The 53-year-old farmer is now preaching his methods across the Amazon, putting him on the front line of a battle to preserve the forest and transform the cattle industry there.
Many scientists blame deforestation, generated in large part by cattle rearing, for global climate change and less predictable rain patterns in the Amazon.
Clearing Amazonian forest to create new pastures is illegal now in Brazil, but a cash-strapped government is struggling to enforce the law in a region as large as half the continental U.S.
"Farmers always find a way to cheat," said Daniel Azeredo, Brazil's top environmental prosecutor. He said the best hope of stopping deforestation is convincing ranchers they can make money without cutting trees.
While nearly 60,000 ranchers in the Amazon adopted sustainable practices in the past decade, according to government officials, about 330,000 haven't. Last year, ranchers cleared a swath the size of Delaware.
"Cattle producers beat their chests about doing things the way their grandfathers did," Mr. Costa said. "They act as if ranchers were saints exploited by meatpackers, the government was a nuisance and that environmental activists were devils."
Brazil is home to the largest cattle herd in the world earmarked for meat -- 214 million cows. The Amazon alone is home to 87 million head, which is 30 million more than in all of Argentina and nearly the size of the total U.S. herd, 90 million, including dairy cows, according to U.S. figures.
Many Amazon ranchers say they can't absorb the high cost of sustainable farming.
"Over here there are no roads, no financing, no help from the government," said Arlindo Laureano Rosa, whose 6,000 cattle roam free in the Amazonian state of Para. "We have to sell our cattle on the cheap. It makes no sense to make them more expensive by using feedlots."
Donning a beige felt hat and a buckle engraved with the name of his farm, Marupiara, Mr. Costa traveled 1,100 miles recently, visiting areas where deforestation is rampant. He met environmental regulators and ranchers, crunching numbers for them on a notebook to show how feedlots -- where cattle eat grain rather than grass -- can pay off financially.
His advice: move the herd around to allow grass time to regrow. During the dry season, move the cattle to feedlots while the pasture is fertilized.
Mr. Costa, who has 2,500 head of cattle, says he produces 750 pounds of meat per acre, up from 151 pounds 15 years ago, and he has been able to keep 80% of his land covered with forest, as mandated by law.
"When I say, 'You can get more beef out of the same land,' they say I'm crazy," said Mr. Costa, as he drove across farmland on a recent sweltering day. "I feel like a Martian."
He uses electronic earrings to track each of his Nelore cattle, weighs the herd regularly and frequently analyzes the soil. The data make it possible to meet productivity targets, decide which nutrients the soil needs and detect suppliers of calves that aren't gaining weight fast enough while helping to improve genetics. The tracking system also makes it easier to sell cows to meatpackers required by law to ensure Amazonian livestock isn't raised in newly deforested areas.
Moacyr Dias-Filho, a technician from the government agency for agricultural research, Embrapa, said ranchers would make bigger profits by obeying the law. He says ranchers who graze cattle the old-fashioned way are damaging land and falling behind competitors.
"Farmers who don't take a more professional approach will be pushed out of business," Mr. Dias-Filho said.

The Sea Is Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change

Full text: Of all known and imagined consequences of climate change, many people fear sea-level rise most. But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology. The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an "enigma"; it has also been called a riddle and a puzzle.
It is generally thought that sea-level rise accelerates mainly by thermal expansion of sea water, the so-called steric component. But by studying a very short time interval, it is possible to sidestep most of the complications, like "isostatic adjustment" of the shoreline (as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted) and "subsidence" of the shoreline (as ground water and minerals are extracted).
I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45, when a genuine, independently confirmed warming of approximately 0.5 degree Celsius occurred. I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr. I therefore conclude -- contrary to the general wisdom -- that the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise. That means neither does the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide.
This conclusion is worth highlighting: It shows that sea-level rise does not depend on the use of fossil fuels. The evidence should allay fear that the release of additional CO2 will increase sea-level rise.
But there is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate. The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges, many of which have been collecting data for over a century.
The cause of the trend is a puzzle. Physics demands that water expand as its temperature increases. But to keep the rate of rise constant, as observed, expansion of sea water evidently must be offset by something else. What could that be? I conclude that it must be ice accumulation, through evaporation of ocean water, and subsequent precipitation turning into ice. Evidence suggests that accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect for at least several centuries.
It is difficult to explain why evaporation of seawater produces approximately 100% cancellation of expansion. My method of analysis considers two related physical phenomena: thermal expansion of water and evaporation of water molecules. But if evaporation offsets thermal expansion, the net effect is of course close to zero. What then is the real cause of sea-level rise of 1 to 2 millimeters a year?
Melting of glaciers and ice sheets adds water to the ocean and causes sea levels to rise. (Recall though that the melting of floating sea ice adds no water to the oceans, and hence does not affect the sea level.) After the rapid melting away of northern ice sheets, the slow melting of Antarctic ice at the periphery of the continent may be the main cause of current sea-level rise.
All this, because it is much warmer now than 12,000 years ago, at the end of the most recent glaciation. Yet there is little heat available in the Antarctic to support melting.
We can see melting happening right now at the Ross Ice Shelf of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Geologists have tracked Ross's slow disappearance, and glaciologist Robert Bindschadler predicts the ice shelf will melt completely within about 7,000 years, gradually raising the sea level as it goes.
Of course, a lot can happen in 7,000 years. The onset of a new glaciation could cause the sea level to stop rising. It could even fall 400 feet, to the level at the last glaciation maximum 18,000 years ago.
Currently, sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2. We can expect the sea to continue rising at about the present rate for the foreseeable future. By 2100 the seas will rise another 6 inches or so -- a far cry from Al Gore's alarming numbers. There is nothing we can do about rising sea levels in the meantime. We'd better build dikes and sea walls a little bit higher.

Full text: Politicians, bureaucrats, activists, scientists and the media have warned Americans for decades that the Earth is headed toward climate catastrophe. Yet surveys consistently show that less than half of U.S. adults are "deeply concerned" or "very worried" about climate issues. If, as Leonardo DiCaprio insists, climate change is the "most urgent threat facing our entire species," why do a large percentage of Americans not share his fear? Climate crusaders tend to lay fault with nonbelievers' intransigence. But this is its own form of denial and masks the real reason: poor salesmanship.
The promotional efforts of the climate catastrophists have lacked clarity, credibility, and empathy. These are the cornerstones of effective persuasion. Successful advocacy campaigns use lucid names to frame and sell their issues -- "living wage," "welfare queen" or "death tax." Climate can be confounding; it is long-term weather, but environmentalists chide anyone who dares call it that. Since Earth's climate is always fluctuating, the word "change" muddles it with redundancy. Swapping between "climate change" and "global warming" confuses the public.
A good battle cry can rally the troops, but the Paris Agreement's aim is "to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius." That is a far cry from "Remember the Alamo!" And Americans are always turned off by the use of metric units. In the U.S., Toyota wisely markets the 2018 Prius's fuel economy as 52 miles a gallon, not 22 kilometers a liter.
American TV audiences bought Carl Sagan's explanations of how the universe works because of his obvious scientific expertise. Bold statements about complex systems are always more plausible when they are made by people with impeccable credentials. As a Harvard sophomore, Al Gore received a D in a natural=sciences course. Mr. DiCaprio dropped out of high school in 11th grade.
The rank hypocrisy of many of the environmental movement's superstars also alienates potential followers. Messrs. Gore and DiCaprio lead lavish, jet-setting lives. It is hard to heed Tom Steyer's demand to ban offshore oil and gas drilling when Farallon, his hedge fund, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in coal mining. Climate change activists tend to be aggressive advocates, but over-the-top selling doesn't sway people who are undecided. This is as true for political surrogates attributing society's ills to the other party's candidate as it is for green activists linking all manner of extreme weather to climate change.
Scientific impropriety has triggered a popular backlash against the climate change activists. The hockey stick chart, Climategate and questions about the integrity of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate data have all fueled public suspicion. Only 39% of Americans believe climate scientists can be trusted a lot to give full and accurate information on causes of climate change according to Pew.
Failed forecasts diminish believability. A Wall Street firm with multiple wrong market calls would lose clients. The actual rate of warming has come in below what climate models projected, casting doubt on future calculations. Likewise, claims that anyone can precisely estimate what global average temperatures will be decades from now don't pass muster with the average person. There are currently no betting odds for Super Bowl CX in 2076 or S&P 500 futures with December 2099 expiration dates.
The burden of proof in the climate debate lies with those claiming rising temperatures stem primarily from human activity and not other factors. While the prosecution may feel it has a winning case, the jury's verdict is what counts. Labeling dissenting jurors "deniers" -- an insidious association with Holocaust denial -- is a losing courtroom strategy. Most people are naturally disinclined to obsess daily about a phenomenon that started long before they were born and won't reach fruition until long after they die.
It's true that almost all climate scientists believe human-caused global warming is real. Similarly, American adults understand that expert opinions can change or turn out to be spectacularly wrong. Think of the recently overturned consensus on the link between egg consumption and coronary heart disease, or the reports during the 1970s that a new ice age was imminent. Against this backdrop, calling skeptics "anti-science" is counterproductive, especially since skepticism is the essence of the scientific method.
From 2006 to 2016, China increased its annual carbon dioxide emissions 37% while America's yearly output decreased far more than any other country. In the Paris Agreement, China pledged to begin reducing emissions around 2030, meaning it can spew even more greenhouse gas for years to come. The U.S. vowed to reduce its 2025 emissions by 28% from 2005 levels. Yet questioning if the accord is fair to America or will forestall global warming is reliably met with sanctimonious scorn.
My advice to the activists is this: you will attract more supporters to your cause if you can pick a name and stick with it, create a clear call to action, enlist a convincing spokesman with a small carbon footprint, tone down the alarmism, and fix the computer models. Most important, listen to the doubters, don't lambaste them.

Full text: Apple Inc. said Monday that it has achieved a decade-old goal of having its facilities world-wide powered exclusively by renewable energy, an achievement that will shift the company's sustainability efforts to its supply chain, where about 10% of suppliers have made a similar commitment.
The tech giant said it has improved to be 100% reliant on clean energy from 96% last year in part by contracting renewable energy for the first time in India, Turkey, Brazil and Mexico. The figure covers all of the company's retail stores, offices, data centers and partner data centers, as well as its new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., Apple Park, the spaceshiplike structure that features rooftop solar panels and is one of the largest on-site solar installations in the world.
Apple is just one of many global corporations trying to cut energy consumption and shift to renewable power including wind and solar, both to cut costs and slow climate change. More than 100 companies world-wide, including Apple, IKEA, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA and Starbucks Corp., pledged in 2014 to shift to 100% renewable energy. By the end of 2016, 25 had met the pledge, according to the collaborative, named RE100.
In recent years, large investors have been pushing for companies to disclose more about both their environmental impact and their efforts to mitigate the environmental risks. BlackRock Inc., which is one of Apple's largest investors, added climate change last year to the list of topics it discusses with the companies in which it invests, for example. It also joined with Vanguard Group in supporting a shareholder proposal that called on Exxon Mobil Corp. to share more information about how climate change could affect its operations.
Many of the RE100 companies are now trying to accelerate efforts to persuade their suppliers to join them. While becoming 100% dependent on clean energy at the company's facilities is an achievement, environmental experts said the bigger challenge will be making the manufacturers of the more than 200 million iPhones and 43 million iPads it sells annually wholly dependent on renewable energy.
"We're not going to stop until our supply chain is 100% renewable," said Apple Vice President of Environment Lisa Jackson in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Apple, which set that goal two years ago, said nine more of its suppliers have committed to powering all production with 100% clean energy, bringing the total to 23 out of more than 200 suppliers. Many of those suppliers are in Asian countries without the same pressure from consumers and investors that Apple gets in the U.S.
Those countries "do not have the same ingrained sense of corporate responsibility that Apple has," said Ethan Zindler, the head of U.S. research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Ms. Jackson added that Apple also will be challenged to keep its own facilities at the 100% level in the years ahead, especially as it looks to add a new campus in the U.S. and $10 billion in data centers.
Apple has been a supporter of environmental issues for years. Chief Executive Tim Cook pressed for the U.S. to stay in the Paris climate treaty and sent a memo to employees saying that climate change is real. The company last week stated its opposition to repealing the Clean Power Plan in a letter filed with the Environmental Protection Agency, saying it would increase investment uncertainty.
"We think that it's a matter of good policy and good sense to move toward cleaner forms of energy," Ms. Jackson said.

Full text: Regarding Phelim McAleer's "Climate Alarmists May Inherit the Wind" (op-ed, April 2): A sure sign climate alarmists are attempting to stampede public opinion is the complete absence from their narrative of even a single benefit that might ensue from a warmer planet. Yet there are many. One, for example, is the prospect that all those blue state retirees who now populate my native state of Florida turning it to a pallid purple may decamp to a newly balmy climate like, say, Minnesota, thus restoring the state to its once radiant red.

Full text: The Environmental Protection Agency moved to ease Obama-era vehicle emissions standards, siding with car makers who say the rules don't work in an era of cheap gas, and setting up a fight with environmentalists and California.
The rules would require auto makers to cut emissions enough so that new vehicles sold averaged more than 50 miles a gallon by 2025. Monday's decision would start a process to relax future standards covering vehicle model years 2022-2025. The standards equal roughly 36 mpg in real-world driving for 2025.
The decision is expected to prompt a battle with California and other states that have implemented tougher controls on greenhouse-gas emissions to limit air pollution and slow climate change. California has a waiver under the Clean Air Act that allows it to set its own, higher standards. The EPA said in its news release Monday that it is re-examining that waiver.
Redrafting these standards has been one of the Trump administration EPA's highest priorities, and is part of its effort to undo Obama-era climate rules that it calls overly strict.
Auto makers have argued current standards are unrealistic at a time when consumers demand less-efficient cars and trucks. After oil prices plummeted in recent years, sales of pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles soared. They now account for more than 60% of the U.S. market.
In making the move, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt criticized Obama administration officials, saying they misread the market. He also claimed they rushed their review of vehicle efficiency for political reasons, noting they set the standards after a review they started and completed in two months, immediately after Donald Trump won the 2016 election.
While the deadline for making a final determination wasn't until April 2018, the EPA was free to make it earlier and said in November 2016 that its process was exhaustive. Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator at the time, said then that current rules were "affordable and effective," and were on track to double fuel economy.
On Monday, she said the Obama administration collaborated with the auto industry on what improvements it could make without upsetting strong profits. She added that the transportation sector rivals power plants as the top source of greenhouse emissions.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has won legal victories aimed at stopping regulatory rollbacks, on Monday reiterated his threat to sue over emissions policy.

Full text: A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit that Exxon Mobil Corp. had filed to stop government investigations into its assertions about climate change.
Manhattan U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni on Thursday dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning the complaint cannot be refiled.
"Exxon's allegations that the [state attorneys general] are pursuing bad faith investigations in order to violate Exxon's constitutional rights are implausible and therefore must be dismissed for failure to state a claim," she wrote.
In 2015, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Exxon Mobil, seeking documents about its research on and response to climate change over several decades. About six months later, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey filed a similar demand.
Exxon, in a civil complaint initially filed in Texas, had asked federal courts to stop the New York and Massachusetts attorneys general from investigating whether the oil giant misled investors and the public by playing down the impact of global warming, saying the investigations were politically motivated.
A company representative couldn't be reached for comment Thursday after regular business hours.

Full text: LONDON -- Royal Dutch Shell PLC is on a spree of small but strategic acquisitions in an area oil companies have long avoided: the power sector.
In the past few months, the British-Dutch oil giant bought a utility, an electric-car charging business and a stake in a solar-power company, part of a broader long-term plan to marry its huge natural-gas output with a futuristic utility business.
Shell is making a bet it can profit from changes to the power market as renewables begin to play a bigger role, combining its large energy-trading division and massive natural-gas supply -- the world's largest from a non-state-backed company -- to fill gaps when the sun doesn't shine or wind doesn't blow. Eventually, Shell said it could even compete with tech companies, crunching data about how and when customers use electricity to give them a better deal.
If all goes according to plan over several decades, Shell said it would produce gas at the well, use it to produce electricity and then sell power to homes, businesses and electric-vehicle charging stations -- a similar model to its oil-rig-to-gas-station petroleum business.
It "makes us future-proof in a world where electricity becomes the biggest game in town," said Maarten Wetselaar, Shell's head of gas and new energies, in a recent interview.
Shell last month bought a midsize U.K. power supplier, First Utility, for an undisclosed amount, giving it direct access to retail electricity consumers for the first time. Last year, the company bought one of Europe's biggest electric-vehicle charging companies, New Motion, also for an undisclosed sum.
The company is in a partnership with Ionity -- a joint venture of large car manufacturers established to create a network of fast-charging points across Europe. In January, Shell announced plans to acquire a nearly 44% stake in U.S. solar company Silicon Ranch Corp. in a deal valued at about $200 million.
Shell has said it plans to spend between $1 billion and $2 billion a year in what it calls its "New Energies" division through 2020 -- more than many other large oil companies are setting aside for renewables and electricity generation. The company is building wind farms off Europe's coast and has said future investments could also include gas-fired power plants.
The moves reflect Shell's need to find an outlet for its prodigious natural-gas output, which grew with the company's roughly $50 billion acquisition of BG Group in 2016.
They also show how Shell and other large oil companies are anticipating shifts in energy consumption, as many governments try to reduce fossil-fuel consumption under the 2015 United Nations Paris agreement to fight climate change. Whether oil demand will level off in the coming decades is up for debate, while electricity consumption is widely expected to increase.
By 2050, power consumption is expected to outstrip demand for Shell's core business of oil and gas, said Mr. Wetselaar. The company's most recent of several potential scenarios, published Monday, foresees a world in which demand for oil and gas peaks in the next 50 years, driven by successful efforts to meet global climate goals. Reliance on electricity, by contrast, is expected grow from around 20% of energy consumption to closer to 50% by midcentury.
"To be an energy major by then, we'd better play in that sector," Mr. Wetselaar said of electricity.

Full text: Paul C. Quigg points out (Letters, March 21) that the small temperature fluctuations brought about by global climate change pose no direct problem to the human race as we easily adapt and live in a broad range of climatic conditions. He is correct.
What isn't emphasized is that we are already seeing higher rates of disruptions and die-offs in various species of plants and animals. These changes are already causing significant problems in many geographical areas and biological niches. I would hope that we all strive to keep aware of the larger picture and understand that the earth is a complex balance of ecological systems, and that we have grown large enough in both number and impact that we affect the planet's health in significant ways.
It is time we assume the role of intelligently managing our planet so that it remains healthy for our children and our children's children.

Full text: I am sure it is true, as Oren Cass indicates, that advanced countries will adapt to climate change ("Doomsday Climate Scenarios Are a Joke," op-ed, March 12). They can move cities inland, build massive sea walls, air-condition everybody and grow crops in climate-controlled shelters. That may well be where the 20% of GDP goes. The poorer countries of the world won't have these options. Their only hope will be to migrate to the advanced countries -- an emigrant crises much greater than anything we see now.
David B. Wood

Mr. Cass ignores the social and economic costs of adaptation. Yes, the mortality rate associated with extreme heat in cities is being reduced by increased use of air conditioning, but that increased use itself helps drive climate change, as it requires electric power largely derived from fossil fuels.
Riley Newman
Irvine, Calif.
---
If a person moved from Boston, Mass., to Miami, Fla., he or she would experience a 26-degree Fahrenheit change in the average temperature in a matter of days. There would certainly be some serious adjusting but I doubt that he or she would shrivel up and die. If the global temperature were to rise three, four or five degrees in the next 50 to 75 years, I don't think anyone would even notice except the doomsday crowd.

Full text: As Oren Cass points out in "Doomsday Climate Scenarios Are A Joke" (op-ed, March 12), society is constantly adapting to all sorts of changes. That is definitely true, and the best way to adapt to climate change and avoid some of those "doomsday" scenarios is for society to adapt to a carbon-free future fueled by renewable energy. To do otherwise in the face of projected climate changes would be, as Mr. Cass puts it, "silly."

Full text: Debates over climate change are filled with dire estimates of its cost. This many trillions of dollars of damage, that large a share of gross domestic product destroyed, so-and-so many lives lost, etc. Where do such figures come from? Mostly from laughably bad economics.
This has nothing to do with the soundness of climate science. The games begin when economists get their hands on scientific projections and try to translate temperatures into human impacts. They conduct statistical analyses of the effects that small year-to-year temperature variations have on things like mortality and economic growth, and try to extrapolate to the effect of very large, slow shifts in underlying climate. This creates absurd estimates that ignore human society's capacity for adaptation. This is the latest iteration of the same mistake environmental catastrophists seem insistent on making in every generation.
The best illustration lies deep in a 2015 paper published in Nature by professors from Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley. They found that warm countries tended to experience lower economic growth in abnormally warm years, while cold countries experienced higher growth in such years. Applying that relationship to a much warmer world of the future, they concluded that unmitigated climate change would likely reduce global GDP by more than 20% from what it otherwise would reach by century's end.
That is roughly an order of magnitude higher than prior estimates, and it has received widespread media attention. But it is as preposterous as it is stunning.
While the world economy stagnates, the model projects, cold countries will achieve almost unimaginable wealth. Iceland supposedly will achieve annual per capita income of $1.5 million by 2100, more than double that of any other country except Finland ($860,000). Mongolia, which currently ranks 118th in per capita income, is supposed to rise to seventh, at which point the average Mongolian will earn four times as much as the average American. Canada's economy becomes seven times as large as China's.
The technical term to describe this analysis is "silly." Obviously, the relationship posited between temperature and growth has little to do with reality.
Sadly, this paper represents the norm. Last fall the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a summary of existing research on future climate costs for the United States. As I show in a new report published by the Manhattan Institute, a small set of studies dominate this research. They reach their imposing dollar figures by refusing, like the Nature study, to consider how society will evolve and adapt.
One Environmental Protection Agency study estimates the potential increase in extreme-temperature deaths by looking at city-specific effects. It assumes that a day counting as unusually hot for some city in 2000 will cause a similar mortality increase in that city in 2100, even if climate change makes it no longer unusual.
The result is a projection that a hot day will kill massive numbers in Northern cities by 2100 -- though such temperatures are already routine at lower latitudes with no such ill effects. Pittsburgh's extreme-temperature mortality rate is supposed to be 75 times as high in 2100 as that of Phoenix in 2000, though Pittsburgh will not be as hot then as Phoenix was a century earlier.
But if Pittsburgh's climate steadily warms over the coming century, it will not react to a 100-degree day in 2100 the same way it did in 2000. Even if it didn't warm, we should assume that economic and technological advancement will make the city and its residents more resilient to heat than they are today.
Another analysis relied on by GAO, taking its own approach to extreme-temperature deaths, inadvertently makes this point -- then proceeds to ignore it. The "American Climate Prospectus" attempts to combine two different studies that consider whether very hot days -- during which the average temperature is above 90 degrees -- have higher mortality than days with moderate temperatures. The first of these studies used data from 1968 --2002 and found that the answer was yes.
But a second study, published later by some of the same authors, looked at how this relationship had changed over time. Here they found that the mortality rate on hot days had declined precipitously. The adoption of air-conditioning, they concluded, "has positioned the United States to be well adapted to the high-temperature-related mortality impacts of climate change."
Incredibly, even though overlapping authors had contributed to both of these studies, and one of them was also a reviewer of the "Prospectus" analysis, the "Prospectus" ignored the declining-mortality trend and claimed climate change would kill tens of thousands annually.
This question of adaptation, and how to account for a future different from the present, is not an esoteric detail for science and economics. It is fundamental to understanding the challenge posed by climate change.
If you imagine society is static and incapable of innovation, the prospect of climate change must be terrifying -- all of humanity paralyzed like Michelle Pfeiffer in "What Lies Beneath," watching the bathtub fill slowly with water.
But horror movies are not reality. The 1960s overpopulation scare made sense, assuming that society would not find more productive ways to farm. The 1970s fear of impending limits to growth made sense, assuming that society could not expand a finite supply of resources. Those doomsday predictions failed because the underlying assumption was mistaken. Society is constantly adapting to all sorts of changes. If a projection of climate-change cost ignores adaptation, we can safely ignore it.

Full text: The political tide may be turning against the corn ethanol mandate. The Renewable Fuel Standard, which forces oil refiners to mix corn-based fuel into gasoline, is one of history's great policy boondoggles. Even ex-Rep. Henry Waxman of California, a key sponsor of the original legislation establishing the standard, said Thursday that he favors phasing out the mandate.
There's bipartisan support in Congress for such a move. Sen. Tom Udall (D., N.M.) and Rep. Peter Welch (D., Vt.) have introduced the Greener Fuels Act, and Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) is said to be working his own legislation altering the mandate, in response to the recent closure of a Pennsylvania refinery.
The corn ethanol mandate was created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Two years later, President Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which expanded the program by providing generous tax credits and subsidies to corn growers and ethanol blenders. It also established ambitious targets, increasing annually, for biofuels in the national fuel mix. The mandate soon diverted 40% of America's corn crop away from the food supply.
The government-imposed shortage caused corn prices to float from long-term mean levels of about $2 per bushel to more than $8 per bushel in 2012. This extraordinary price surge prompted a range of harmful responses in the farming industry. Farmers planted 17 million new acres of corn at the expense of soybeans, wheat, hay and cotton, driving prices for those crops to all-time highs as well. Cattle farmers, unable to afford corn gluten feed, culled their herds to levels not seen in 60 years, causing beef prices to rise an incredible 60% from 2007 to 2012. Over this five-year period, the IMF food price index rose 42%.
The stress on the economy was intense. The mandate became untenable until the Environmental Protection Agency announced in August 2013 that it was weighing freezing the annual ethanol blend mandate at 14 billion gallons (it ultimately followed through). This caused the bubble to burst in a spectacular fashion. The new blend level was rightly viewed as a cut in future demand, and corn prices collapsed in subsequent months.
The country has endured a startling amount of economic disruption for what is clearly an inferior source of energy. Ethanol produces 34% less energy per volume than conventional gasoline, reducing cars' fuel economy. As for its effect on the environment, a 2010 Congressional Budget Office study found that corn-based ethanol subsidies are terribly inefficient, with the government spending an estimated $754 per metric ton of avoided emissions -- an astronomically high price tag compared with other policies. (The economics of climate change literature estimates the "social cost of carbon" at far lower levels, meaning the program is inefficient even on its own terms.)
Moreover, ethanol is too corrosive to be transported through pipelines, so trucks must transport it. Growing corn also requires more water than other crops -- and the policy gave farmers an incentive to plant only corn, which depleted the soil of nutrients. A 2008 study in Science found that converting natural environments for biofuel production can produce hundreds of times more carbon emissions than the biofuels themselves would save. No wonder ethanol mandates are losing support among environmentalists.
One of the professed goals of the ethanol mandate was to wean the U.S. from its reliance on foreign oil -- but the U.S. is already approaching energy independence because of offshore drilling programs unleashed by the Trump administration's deregulatory blitz. And if the ethanol mandate were really about encouraging biofuel consumption, why has Congress imposed tariffs that keep out cheap Brazilian sugarcane ethanol? The truth is that the program is motivated more by the demands of domestic corn-growers than by concern over oil dependence or climate change.
Revising the mandate will take significant courage and political will, but it's clearly the right thing to do. The ethanol lobby is extraordinarily powerful, recycling profits gained from this self-dealing policy right back into efforts to protect it. Iowa's Republican senators, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst -- otherwise solid conservatives -- are in thrall to this corporate welfare program and will fight to the death to keep it. But the time has come to modify the ethanol mandate before the costs to the economy and the environment grow steeper.

Full text: Debates over climate change are filled with dire estimates of its cost. This many trillions of dollars of damage, that large a share of gross domestic product destroyed, so-and-so many lives lost, etc. Where do such figures come from? Mostly from laughably bad economics.
This has nothing to do with the soundness of climate science. The games begin when economists get their hands on scientific projections and try to translate temperatures into human impacts. They conduct statistical analyses of the effects that small year-to-year temperature variations have on things like mortality and economic growth, and try to extrapolate to the effect of very large, slow shifts in underlying climate. This creates absurd estimates that ignore human society's capacity for adaptation. This is the latest iteration of the same mistake environmental catastrophists seem insistent on making in every generation.
The best illustration lies deep in a 2015 paper published in Nature by professors from Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley. They found that warm countries tended to experience lower economic growth in abnormally warm years, while cold countries experienced higher growth in such years. Applying that relationship to a much warmer world of the future, they concluded that unmitigated climate change would likely reduce global GDP by more than 20% from what it otherwise would reach by century's end.
That is roughly an order of magnitude higher than prior estimates, and it has received widespread media attention. But it is as preposterous as it is stunning.

Iceland supposedly will achieve annual per capita income of $1.5 million by 2100, more than double that of any other country except Finland ($860,000). Mongolia, which currently ranks 118th in per capita income, is supposed to rise to seventh, at which point the average Mongolian will earn four times as much as the average American.

Full text: HOUSTON -- The heads of some of the world's largest oil companies pushed back on Tuesday against predictions that demand for petroleum could erode in coming decades due to the rise of renewable energy and electric vehicles.
Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, told the CERAWeek conference in Houston that such forecasts overstate the economic costs of shifting to greener sources of energy and underestimate the continued dominance of fossil fuels.
"I'm not losing any sleep over peak oil demand or stranded resources," Mr. Nasser said. He warned instead that more investment is needed in the oil sector to ensure there is enough supply to meet future demand.
Bob Dudley, CEO of BP PLC, said that while the company could foresee a potential peak in oil demand and a transition to a diverse mix of fuels, a recent study showed that demand would remain robust even under a scenario in which the sale of new internal-combustion vehicles was banned by 2040.
"The pace of decline is likely to be very slow," Mr. Dudley said. "Think plateau."
Mr. Dudley also said carbon emissions would continue to rise in such a scenario, underscoring the need to focus on ways to reduce emissions across all sources.
"A race to renewables will not solve the challenge that we all have," he said. We need to be agnostic about new fuels."
The comments on the future of oil demand are the latest in a spirited debate over what the next few decades may hold for the oil sector, with some major companies predicting that efforts to curb global warming could mean oil consumption stops growing before the end of the next decade.
Investors are increasingly calling on oil-and-gas companies to show they have a plan to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, even staging a rare revolt at Exxon Mobil Corp.'s annual meeting last year over the issues.
Companies will likely have to disclose more about the potential impact of climate change and regulations tied to limiting emissions on their businesses in the next five to 10 years, ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance said Tuesday.
"The disclosure is getting more difficult," he said, noting that he, along with other executives, received a letter from BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink this year, which pushed companies to articulate a "social purpose."
"More of that's going to have to come," Mr. Lance said.
Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of France's Total SA, sounded a slightly different note at the conference on Monday, describing a future in which his company becomes a bigger player in natural gas and electricity as the world moves to lower-carbon energy sources. "Maybe we will become, I am sure, a gas-and-oil company," instead of an oil-and-gas company, Mr. Pouyanne said.
Mr. Nasser said that the internal combustion engine still has 99% of the market and that adopting electric vehicles won't address climate change unless the electricity needed to power the cars is produced more cleanly, which he believes renewables won't do economically for years to come.

Full text: The Pyeongchang Winter Olympics are the kind of Games that Olympic leaders are trying to leave behind.
These Games, which open Friday, spurred $10 billion in construction of facilities in a remote area far from the European and North American hubs of winter sports. Ticket sales lagged as tensions with the host country's increasingly restive nuclear-armed neighbor, North Korea, scared off some visitors.
Now, North Korea will participate in the Games thanks to a controversial last-minute agreement between Seoul and Pyongyang -- a deal that has irritated some South Koreans who think attention for their years of planning has now been swiped by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In the U.S., an exodus of younger Olympics viewers and a lack of recognizable stars threaten to extend a yearslong decline in TV ratings and strain NBC's $1.3 billion investment in media rights.
"All of these coming together in one Olympics Games could be quite challenging for the Olympic movement within the United States," says Heather Dichter, associate professor of business and an Olympics scholar at De Montfort University in Leicester, England.
The International Olympic Committee is a few years into a plan that aims to make the Olympic Games more sustainable, affordable and accessible. But since these Games were awarded before that push, they will resemble the status quo: a skyline of pricey new facilities at the end of a long journey for most athletes and fans -- plus a still-unfolding exercise in political triage.
North Korea is sending 22 athletes to compete in five events in the Games. The South Korean women's hockey team will incorporate North Korean players, and athletes from North and South will march in the Opening Ceremony under a unified flag.
Though some see the agreement as placating a hostile government, others see participation of North Korean athletes as a sign of hope -- or insurance against disruptive actions during the Olympics.
About 10,000 miles and a half-day on the clock away -- Pyeongchang is 14 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern time -- American viewers will greet a largely new Olympics cast of characters. Most medal contenders -- including snowboarder Chloe Kim and figure skater Nathan Chen -- are largely unknown to casual U.S. viewers. The NHL's decision not to send its players to the Olympics means men's hockey games will look less like all-star matchups and more like the Great Lakes Invitational. But there will be some familiar names. Snowboarder Shaun White and skier Lindsey Vonn are contenders in their events, skier Mikaela Shiffrin is a rising star and a deep U.S. team has a chance to win the medal count.
Even NBC's lineup has been overhauled. Longtime prime-time host Bob Costas has moved on, and Matt Lauer exited after a report of inappropriate workplace behavior at the 2014 Olympics. Mike Tirico, a daytime host for the 2016 Olympics, takes over the lead role in prime time. NBC also wooed back Katie Couric to host the opening ceremony, her first since the 2004 Summer Games.
The Pyeongchang Olympics' $12.6 billion tab so far is close (by Olympic standards) to its $11.8 projected budget and far below the Sochi Games' reported $51 billion price tag. Christophe Dubi, IOC Executive Director for the Olympic Games, praised organizers' years of work and called Pyeongchang "a superb new destination."
Yet prospects to keep the facilities in regular use after the Games are slim, given that they sit in a lightly populated area not widely known for winter sports. A few years ago, Pyeongchang organizers declined the option of co-hosting some Olympic events, such as bobsled and other sliding events at an existing facility in Japan.
"At the time they were not open to change and they decided to continue with building a number of venues," Dubi says, noting that leadership in South Korea's government and in the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee have since changed.
Pyeongchang Olympics spokesman Lim Song-jae says when the IOC reached out about alternative venues in early 2015, work on Pyeongchang's sliding center already was under way. Final price tag: more than $100 million.
Pyeongchang organizers say they support the IOC's reforms and are using six existing venues for these Olympics. They said the Games' budget includes spending on infrastructure that will benefit the region for years, including a high-speed railway.
Another reform was limiting Winter Olympics to about 100 events and 2,900 total athletes, says Kit McConnell, IOC sports director. Emphasis is on "about": Pyeongchang will have 102 events and 2,925 athletes.
Pyeongchang has one major advantage over recent Winter Games sites: cold weather. The average daily temperature in its mountains during the weeks of the Olympics over the past 10 years has been about 23 degrees Fahrenheit. That's much more snow-friendly than coastal Sochi or Vancouver.
In the longer-term, global climate change will limit the number of locations where Winter Olympics can take place, according to analysis by researchers led by the University of Waterloo in Ontario. If global emissions of greenhouse gases aren't dramatically reduced, only eight of the 21 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics would be cold enough to reliably host them again, researchers say.
The Paralympics are at greater risk because they're typically held the month after the Olympics, in March. Future Paralympics might have to be moved to a separate location or run concurrently with the Olympics, says Dr. Daniel Scott, university research chair in climate and society at the University of Waterloo.
The Winter Games' biggest obstacle might be public sentiment. Innsbruck, Austria, was preparing a bid for the 2026 Olympics that seemed to align perfectly with the IOC's goals. The area had hosted the Olympics twice before and had nearly all the facilities needed. Austrian voters rejected the idea in a referendum. Current 2026 Olympics candidates include Calgary, Stockholm, Sapporo, Japan, and Sion, Switzerland, Dubi says.
For its challenges, Pyeongchang appears to have all of its relevant hardware in place.

Full text: One of President Donald Trump's top environmental nominees is withdrawing after a year of criticism for being skeptical about climate change and for calling global warming a "kind of paganism."
Kathleen Hartnett White, Mr. Trump's choice to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality, asked to withdraw this weekend. She cited a nomination process that had dragged on for more than a year.
Once considered a top contender to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Ms. Hartnett White ended up encountering tough opposition from Democrats in the Senate for an oversight role ensuring federal agencies are meeting environmental obligations. Critics viewed her environmental positions as extreme, even for an administration with several nominees who have questioned humans' influence on climate change or previously worked at fossil-fuel companies or lobbied for them.
Ms. Hartnett White is a fellow at the free-market think tank Texas Public Policy Foundation and was previously chairman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Her work at the foundation rejected the idea of carbon as a pollutant that worsens global warming and instead celebrated the fossil-fuel industry for pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, saying that helps plants grow.
At a congressional hearing last year, she said she was "uncertain" climate change was real before then saying it was real but that it isn't clear how much of it is caused by human activity.
The federal government's "Climate Change Special Report" issued last year said there is growing evidence that human activities are responsible for climate change and extreme weather events and that currently "there are no alternative explanations."
In recent weeks, Ms. Hartnett White's nomination appeared to be casting a larger shadow. After EPA administrator Scott Pruitt testified last week in front of the Senate environment committee, its top Democrat, Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, told Mr. Pruitt that Democrats on the committee wouldn't be likely to help EPA nominees get approvals while Ms. Hartnett White's nomination was still under consideration.

Full text: Global temperatures simmered at near-record levels in 2017, even as the world cooled slightly with the waning of a powerful El Nino event that had driven recent warming to levels unprecedented in modern times, federal climate experts said Thursday.
In an annual report, scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which independently track the rise and fall of world temperatures for the federal government, ranked last year as among the three warmest since systematic record-keeping began in 1880.
NASA researchers ranked 2017 as the second-warmest year since 1880, while NOAA scientists ranked it as the third-warmest. Both analyses show that the five warmest years on record all occurred since 2010.
"Despite colder-than-average temperatures in any one part of the world, temperatures over the planet as a whole continue the rapid warming trend we've seen over the last 40 years," said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, which conducted the space agency's analysis.
By NASA's calculation, globally averaged temperatures in 2017 were 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.90 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1951 to 1980 mean, second only to global temperatures in 2016. In the NOAA analysis, the average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.51 degrees F (0.84 degrees C) above the 20th century norm.
The agency teams essentially cross-check other's findings, using different collections of readings from thousands of weather stations and different mathematical methods.
Their calculations are in line with other independent assessments of the year's global warming trend. Preliminary reports by the Japan Meteorological Agency and the World Meteorological Organization, as well as satellite-temperature data maintained by researchers at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, all suggest that 2017 was the second- or third-warmest on record.
"There are, of course, year-to-year and decade-to-decade natural fluctuations brought about by variability in the sun, volcanic eruptions and natural oscillations such as El Nino," said atmosphere scientist Kerry Emanuel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who studies climate change's effects on hurricanes. "But the long-term trend is unmistakable."
Roger Pielke Sr. at the Cooperative Institute for Research In Environmental Sciences in Boulder, Colo., said that the basic methodology used in the rankings is "flawed" because it relies solely on surface temperatures and doesn't take into consideration other measures, such as deep ocean heat, that affect global climate.
All told, 17 of the 18 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000. The trend has been driven in large part by land-use changes, including cutting down forests and paving over natural surfaces, and rising emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and methane from livestock production.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt plans to use his second year on the job to accelerate efforts to remake the agency, saying he wants to speed its permitting processes and transform a culture he says is bureaucratic.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Pruitt outlined the changes he is looking to make in year two: repealing and rewriting Obama-era rules for power-plant emissions, speeding up the EPA's permit review process, implementing weekly performance assessments across the agency, and fostering a public debate about climate change.
Mr. Pruitt has long questioned the scientific consensus that human activities are a significant factor in rising global temperatures and severe weather, and pose a potential existential threat to life on Earth in decades to come.
Discussing his plans for the year, Mr. Pruitt emphasized the importance of moving quickly. "There's tremendous opportunity to show really significant results to the American people in a really short time frame," Mr. Pruitt said.
In his first year on the job, the former Oklahoma attorney general swiftly repealed several of former President Barack Obama's signature policies and encouraged President Donald Trump to pursue a withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Mr. Trump announced his intention to exit from the agreement in June.
Mr. Pruitt has memorialized the moment in his office with a framed photo of the two of them in the Rose Garden and the president's autograph on Mr. Pruitt's prepared remarks, "Scott -- Great Job!"
Going forward, Mr. Pruitt wants to use metrics to measure the weekly performance of every EPA office and wants final permit decisions completed within six months. He already has a multicolored pyramid diagram outlining his plan to streamline the agency's bureaucracy and organizational workflow.
"That's the thing that's been so striking to me as I've come into this position . . . is just the lack of focus and lack of energy and lack of commitment to actually get results," said Mr. Pruitt, speaking during a 30-minute interview in his wood-paneled office this week. "We have permits that literally are sitting on a shelf, and just sitting there because there's just no attention, no leadership, no direction. It's that simple."
Mr. Pruitt said he inherited an agency that employs hundreds of scientists and nevertheless contracts out some of its research.
"Everything the agency does is to protect public health and the public from future risks," said Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator during the Obama administration. "You don't stop smoking because it kills you when you smoke the cigarette; it's because it kills you later. It's the same argument with climate change. You take action today to protect health today and in the future."
Ms. McCarthy, who now teaches at the Harvard School of Public Health, said Mr. Pruitt's statement that the effects of climate change won't be felt for decades "rings extremely hollow" after a year in which the federal government spent $306 billion responding to extreme weather events. "Anyone suggesting that climate change isn't happening or damaging us today is not keeping their eyes open," she said.
The EPA chief also said in the interview that he believes the agency exceeded its legal mandate under Mr. Obama in creating new rules for power plants in the name of slowing the pace of climate change. "This agency for years has speculated about harm that may be happening 100 years from now as opposed to what's right in their own backyard," Mr. Pruitt said.
In 2018, he said he plans to focus on cleaning up toxic sites in the Superfund program and with what he calls "the war on lead."
"I really believe that we can eradicate lead from our drinking supply within a decade. We just have to get serious about it," Mr. Pruitt said. "We haven't been focused and urgent about the things that matter and can impact people's health today, and we need to do that."
Asked if his urgency has anything to do with future plans to leave, Mr. Pruitt played down a recent report by Politico suggesting he is angling to succeed Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but he didn't fully rule anything out. "I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoy what I'm doing," he said. "What does it say in Scripture? 'Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.' And that's what I'm doing."
---
Staffers Exit Amid
Mounting Criticism
Some of Scott Pruitt's policies, and his criticism of the Environmental Protection Agency as bureaucratic and hidebound, have turned off career employees, including many scientists.
With about 700 staffers departing last year, the agency's work force is about 4.1% smaller than it was at the end of 2016, putting it among executive departments and agencies with the biggest declines, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management.
"At the same time [Mr. Pruitt] is making these comments, he's basically doing everything he can to gut the agency of quality personnel," said John O'Grady, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents EPA workers.
"They are basically going to break government and then somehow declare victory," Mr. O'Grady said.
Mr. O'Grady pointed to Mr. Pruitt's sometimes antagonistic position toward agency scientists, saying it will be difficult for the EPA to finish research, write policies and grant permits more quickly if the staff and resources keep shrinking. The Trump administration has threatened budget cuts, and the departures have brought staff to about 14,000 workers, the lowest point in more than 30 years.

Full text: In "Climate-Change Policies Can Be Punishing for the Poor" (op-ed, Jan. 5), Bjorn Lomborg is dead-on to be concerned about how carbon policies would affect the "energy poor." So I find it puzzling that he chose to ignore carbon policies designed to address precisely this issue. Alert readers of this newspaper may recall recent op-eds from James Baker, George Shultz, Hank Paulson and others of the Republican "Climate Leadership Council" featuring a revenue-neutral carbon tax. This simple plan would return a monthly dividend check to every American household of all net proceeds from taxes implemented on carbon where it first enters the economy. Multiple econometric studies have concluded that the poorest 50%-60% of American households -- not just the "energy poor" -- would come out financially ahead with this plan.
Conservatives err in the belief that carbon policies are the exclusive province of the left. The irony is that the most effective solutions to global climate change emanate from practitioners on the right.

Full text: Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday his administration had filed a lawsuit against five major oil companies and was pushing New York City pension funds to divest from fossil fuel, both part of an effort to fight climate change.
"This is a tragedy that was wrought by the fossil-fuel companies," Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference. "We are going after those who have profited. And what a horrible, disgusting way to profit."
The pension fund divestment requires approval from the trustees of the city's five major pension funds. Some funds may choose to implement the proposal while others may not. The $189 billion pension funds hold about $5 billion in securities from fossil-fuel companies, officials said.
The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, asks for billions of dollars to protect the city from climate change. San Francisco and Oakland, Calif., filed similar suits in September against the same five companies.
The city filed the suit against oil companies BP PLC, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC.
A Shell spokesman said the company believes "climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts."
A Chevron spokesman called the lawsuit "factually and legally meritless." An Exxon Mobil spokesman said the company "welcomes any well-meaning and good faith attempt to address the risks of climate change," but that lawsuits such as this one aren't such efforts.
A ConocoPhillips spokesman said the company doesn't comment on pending litigation. BP declined to comment.

Full text: Some big investors and banks are reviewing their bets on an oil-and-gas industry now wrestling with uncertain oil demand, government regulation and disruptive technology like electric vehicles.
The biggest decision will come in Norway, where the government says it will decide this year whether to wind down investments by its $1 trillion sovereign-wealth fund in the oil-and-gas sector. Its assets include multibillion-dollar stakes in Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Chevron Corp. and BP PLC.
Other investors, including French insurance giant AXA Group and Dutch bank ING Groep NV, are pulling back from parts of the industry that contribute most to climate change, like Canada's oil sands. In a world where the heaviest-polluting industries could be penalized, some investors say the financial risks of such investments could outweigh the rewards. For instance, Canada is introducing a carbon tax this year to limit greenhouse-gas emissions from oil sands.
The moves are distinct from calls by environmentalists and so-called ethical investors for divestment from the oil industry, although those sentiments have been taken up by large, mainstream financial institutions more often since the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change. The World Bank said last month it will stop financing oil and gas exploration and drilling by 2019, in support of the Paris goals. French bank BNP Paribas says it will no longer finance some oil projects seen as environmentally damaging.
Renewable energy, once hampered by high costs, has become cheap enough to compete with coal and gas in some instances. The U.K., France, China and India have signaled they plan to eventually ban sales of vehicles with traditional combustion engines.
Norwegian officials say the current debate is entirely pragmatic. The country may be overexposed to a sector undergoing turbulent change by having both a large national oil company, Statoil ASA, and billion-dollar-plus holdings in other oil companies.
"This is really a question of risk diversification," Yngve Slyngstad, chief executive of Norges Bank Investment Management said in an interview. NBIM manages the country's investment fund, which receives Statoil's profits and other energy-focused revenue in Norway for investment elsewhere.
Mr. Slyngstad said the transition from dependency on fossil fuels to alternatives would take several decades. But he said investments in traditional oil companies should come with a "high-risk premium," considering "all the uncertainty around the energy transition."
The Norwegian concerns have "put those industries on alert," said Matt Christensen, global head of responsible investment at AXA's asset-management arm. "The risks which climate change presents are becoming more understood as existential in nature."
To be sure, wholesale divestment from the oil-and-gas sector remains rare. The sheer size of oil giants make it difficult for fund managers to exclude them outright.
BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said Norwegian officials had been "pretty clear with me" that their concerns weren't about climate but about diversification. "I can't argue with that really," he said.
Norway's oil fund owns over 2% of BP's stock, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Any Norwegian oil divestment is likely to be carefully managed and take place over a number of years so as not to disrupt markets.
U.S. investors appear committed to the oil industry but have begun pressuring it to change. Last year, a task force, commissioned by the G-20 and including major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BlackRock Inc., published guidelines pushing for better disclosure of the impact of climate change. Across the U.S., utilities and oil-and-gas companies faced shareholder revolts as investors clamored for more information about how they view climate risk.
"We think we can have more influence from inside the tent," said Rob Main, who sits on the investment stewardship team of Vanguard Group, which holds $4.9 trillion under management. Last summer, it voted against the boards at Exxon and Occidental Petroleum, demanding more disclosure of business risks related to global warming.

Full text: California has become the poster child for how not to deal with climate change ("California's Political Fires," Review & Outlook, Dec. 23). The state's mismanagement has resulted in a net transfer of water from land to sea, and on average the temperature ranges will expand along with even less frequent rainfall. Californians can drive their electric cars, subsidize their wind turbines and pay carbon taxes, but it will not change the climate one iota. Until California attempts to preserve and manage the biological systems it is destroying, it will continue to be a climate change disaster.

California politicians are at it again. Fires in highly populated areas, stuffed with the tinder of dry brush and untended forests, are burning. Yet people still move there and build expensive homes. What is Gov. Jerry Brown's solution? To grandstand about "climate change" rather than take concrete measures to ameliorate the problem. He needs to put an end to tree hugging, pseudo-environmentalism and the crushing taxpayer burden for bullet trains.
Reducing pollution is a worthy cause that will take time and technological innovation. China and India have already begun reducing pollution because it's bad for business. In the meantime, the moralizers in Sacramento are further burdening their citizens with higher taxes and empty rhetoric.

Full text: CLIMATE CHANGE
Trump Says East
Could Use Warming
President Donald Trump says the East Coast "could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming" as bitterly cold temperatures are expected to freeze swaths of the country this holiday weekend.
Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday, "In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year's Eve on record." He added: "Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!"
The president didn't acknowledge the difference between the weather and the climate.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about climate-change science, calling global warming a "hoax" created by the Chinese to damage American industry.
The U.N.'s weather agency has said that 2017 was on track to become the hottest year on record aside from those years affected by the El Nino phenomenon, which can contribute to higher temperatures.

DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
Mattis Breaks
Tradition of Visits
For only the second time since 9/11, America's defense secretary didn't visit U.S. troops in a war zone during December, breaking a longstanding tradition of personally and publicly thanking service members in combat who are away from family during the holidays.
Pentagon boss Jim Mattis, who spent more than four decades in the Marine Corps and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, made a five-day trip through the Middle East in early December. He stopped in Kuwait and Pakistan -- countries adjacent to Iraq and Afghanistan -- but didn't cross the borders to see troops at war in either country.
Asked recently why he wasn't going to Iraq or Afghanistan, Mr. Mattis said he didn't want to discuss his travel. "I carry out my duties to the best of my ability," said Mr. Mattis, who visited Iraq and Afghanistan earlier this year.

SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGED
Singer: Lewandowski
Must Apologize
Singer Joy Villa says she wants an apology from Corey Lewandowski for hitting her twice on her buttocks during a Washington gathering last fall. And she is defending herself against a video that shows her slapping another man's buttocks at a separate event.
Ms. Villa is a Trump supporter and potential congressional candidate. Mr. Lewandowski was Trump's campaign manager until being fired in June 2016.
Ms. Villa told ABC's "Good Morning America" that she has apologized to the man who she hit: "When he said, 'Take it easy,' I stopped." She said, "We have to say 'I'm sorry.' "
Mr. Lewandowski has told Fox Business that due process was under way and would "determine a person's innocence."

Full text: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will push for state pensions to be divested from fossil-fuel companies, but the official who controls the investment funds says the best way to address climate change is by leveraging shareholder power.
The governor said he is creating a plan for divesting the New York State Common Retirement Fund from fossil-fuel investments as part of his 2018 agenda. Mr. Cuomo said he plans to detail this and other initiatives in his Jan. 3 State of the State speech.
The state pension fund is the third largest in the nation, with a value of about $200 billion. Some $3.68 billion is invested in the world's top 200 fossil-fuel companies, according to the most recent estimate. The fund covers about 1 million current and retired public employees.
The fossil-fuel divestment movement has been gaining steam as a way to address climate change by withdrawing support from the oil, gas and coal industries that are seen as driving global warming.
Mr. Cuomo's proposal calls for an end to all new investment in companies with significant fossil fuel-related activities and greater investment in "the clean tech economy."
New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer also said he would seek fossil-fuel divestment for the city's $191 billion pension fund.
State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who is responsible for pension-fund investment decisions, said he has no immediate plans to divest but welcomes the chance to work with the governor. Mr. DiNapoli said he has committed $5 billion of the fund's money to green investing, which he announced two years ago at a United Nations climate change conference in Paris.
Mr. DiNapoli previously has said the pension fund can wield greater power over big oil and gas companies by staying invested. "We've shown that shareholders have the power to compel major corporations, like Exxon Mobil, to address climate change," he said in response to the governor's announcement.

Full text: ISLA VISTA, Calif. -- For her recent hike around an idyllic seaside lagoon, Mika Leslie wore shorts, a cotton T-shirt and a microfiber respirator mask.
A massive cloud of smoke smothered the early-afternoon sun, as the largest wildfire in state history raged about 15 miles away.
"The smoke has been so crazy, the moon is red, the sun is red, and everything is in an orange glow because smoke is just covering everything," said Ms. Leslie, a freshman at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
California's costliest wildfire season on record has sent air quality plummeting in highly populated urban areas and pumped massive quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air, experts say. That has presented a challenge for public-health officials and regulators who seek to limit air pollution in California -- where even using fireplaces, wood stoves and outdoor fire pits is illegal on certain "spare the air" days.
In Southern California, the Thomas Fire has been burning through Ventura and Santa Barbara counties for three weeks. It's the largest wildfire in California's history.
Just two months earlier, blazes ripped through Northern California's wine country. During those October wildfires, air quality in San Francisco was comparable to that in Beijing, officials said. This month, air quality in some Santa Barbara and Ventura county communities hit record-high hazardous levels, making it unsafe for anyone to be outside.
On Thursday, Santa Barbara County declared a public-health emergency due to the air quality.
Anywhere between 20 to 50 people a day have been checking into county clinics and hospitals with symptoms related to the poor air quality since the fires began, said Dr. Charity Dean, public-health officer for Santa Barbara County.
Patients have been prescribed inhalers, pills and other medications to deal with the effects of the smoke. Meanwhile, people walking around with particle-filtering respirator masks have also become a common sight, with the county having distributed more than 300,000 such masks free of charge.
Ms. Leslie, the UCSB freshman, said she got her respirator mask from fellow ultimate Frisbee teammates after practice was canceled due to the record-poor air quality.
Her roommate came down with a suspected case of bronchitis, she said. She has seen ash fall from the sky, covering the seat of her bike when she leaves it parked outside her dorm, she said.
Health problems from wildfire toxins can include heart failure, lung disease, respiratory infections, asthma, bronchitis, hypertension and other issues, according to a presentation last year by the Environmental Protection Agency.

State Prides Itself
On Climate Issues
The public-health and environmental threats from the California fires are a challenge for a state that considers itself a global leader on climate change and has strict air-quality management policies.
The fires "are putting a lot of carbon pollution into the environment, in the air, and that will offset a lot of hard-won reductions," Gov. Jerry Brown said recently while visiting Ventura County.
Under Mr. Brown, California has laid out the aggressive goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. This year, the state also approved legislation that reduces air toxics in communities disproportionately hit by pollution.
This month, the California Air Resources Board, which oversees the state's air quality and climate-change programs, approved its annual plan to reduce emissions in the state, adding measures to reduce emission and pollution from forests and natural lands.
Particulate matter, carbon, ozone, volatile organic compounds, trace gases, air toxics and mercury can all threaten the public during wildfires, according to a 2016 presentation by the Environmental Protection Agency, which described larger and more frequent wildfires as a global public-health problem.
The presentation said nearly a third of the U.S. population was at risk of wildfire toxins.

Full text: BHP Billiton Ltd., the world's largest Western mining company, is threatening to leave the World Coal Association and U.S. Chamber of Commerce over disagreements on climate policy, the latest commodity firm to react to pressure on global warming.
The British-Australian company on Tuesday said it disagreed with the association's call for Australia to abandon its clean-energy targets and promote the use of lower-emission coal.
BHP itself has cut back on coal production in recent years, but remains among the world's biggest coal producers.
The company said Tuesday it differed from the Chamber of Commerce's characterization of the Paris climate agreement as ineffectual and the business group's opposition to taxing carbon emissions.
"We believe the Paris Agreement provides a solid long-term foundation for further progress in the global response to climate change," BHP said. The company pledged earlier this year to review its memberships in industry associations that hold public stances on climate and energy policy.
BHP's announcement comes as the world's biggest energy companies are trying to present themselves as part of the solution for governments and consumers demanding more environmentally friendly energy.
A consortium of 10 big oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC and Saudi Arabia's national energy firm, formed the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative to collaborate on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Exxon Mobil Corp. last month joined Shell and six other major oil companies in moving to reduce pollution from natural-gas production.
Other big mining companies like Rio Tinto PLC and Anglo American PLC have said they support the Paris agreement's global commitments and goals. Glencore PLC has said it recognizes its responsibility to address climate change as a factor that will affect its business.
In response to BHP's announcement, the World Coal Association expressed disappointment and said BHP's review didn't accurately reflect its views. The London-based association is a global lobbyist for coal producers, with its members -- including Anglo American and Glencore -- accounting for 20% of the world's coal production.
"The WCA has always supported a balanced approach that integrates climate and energy policy, working toward a low-emission future for coal. We hope to be able to continue working with BHP on this basis in the future," said the association's chairman, Mick Buffier.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it looked forward to discussing the issues with BHP.
"The chamber believes that the climate is changing, and that man is contributing to these changes," the group said in an email. "We also believe that technology and innovation, rather than unachievable federal mandates, offer the best approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change."
The chamber has warned that U.S. commitments under the Paris agreement could raise energy prices for Americans. President Donald Trump has said he would end the American commitments made at the Paris agreement if he couldn't renegotiate terms.
BHP said its position on leaving the World Coal Association was preliminary and it invited the group to respond by March 31 before it makes a final decision on membership. Similarly, it intends to talk with the Chamber of Commerce, while "considering" its continued membership in the Washington-based group.
BHP said it also identified differences with the Minerals Council of Australia, but has decided to remain a member of the body. However, the company said it would request that the council refrain from policy activity in areas where their views diverge and that it would review its membership if that doesn't happen.
The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a nonprofit group that advises on ethical investments, offered tempered praise for BHP's announcement.
Executive Director Brynn O'Brien criticized the company for staying in the Minerals Council of Australia but called its overall message "an emphatic market signal that the era of aggressive anti-climate lobbying is no longer acceptable."

Full text: LONDON -- Exxon Mobil Corp. has joined with seven other big energy companies to reduce pollution from natural gas production, an effort by the industry to present itself as part of the solution as governments and consumers demand more environmentally friendly energy.
Big oil companies like Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have increasingly touted natural gas as a core tool to combat climate change, since it produces fewer greenhouse- gas emissions than coal, the fuel it often replaces in electricity production.
The rare trans-Atlantic alignment was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, ahead of the companies' announcement Wednesday. The collaboration by companies including Exxon, Shell, BP PLC and Total SA, shows the oil and gas sector is proactively trying to address burgeoning concerns about natural-gas emissions to ensure that its big bet on the fossil fuel pays off.
Major energy companies have made big investments in gas in recent years and are steadily increasing their production volumes. They argue that it will prove a vital source of energy stability even as renewables increase their market share.
But methane, the main component in natural gas, is also a potent greenhouse gas and the issue of fugitive emissions that occur when it leaks into the atmosphere is starting to draw negative attention.
Exxon and its partners said they have signed up to a set of guiding principles, committing to drive down methane emissions from their assets, encourage better performance from their peers, improve transparency and data accuracy on the matter and advocate for better regulation.
"The commitment was made as part of wider efforts by the global energy industry to ensure that natural gas continues to play a critical role in helping meet future energy," the companies said in a joint statement. "Its role in the transition to a low-carbon future will be influenced by the extent to which methane emissions are reduced."
A recent International Energy Agency study found around 76 million tons of methane are emitted every year from global oil and gas operations.
Exxon's decision to join the group leaves Chevron Corp. as the only major U.S. oil company that has yet to join the initiative. Both of the U.S. oil companies have lagged behind their European peers on the issue of climate and Exxon hasn't participated in previous similar efforts to build an industry voice on such subjects.
Still, under pressure from investors over the past year, both of the U.S. companies have undergone an evolution in the way they address climate change publicly.

Full text: Roger Pielke Jr. is wrong when he writes in "A Litigious Climate Threatens Scientific Norms" (op-ed, Nov. 16) that climate scientist Michael Mann's defamation lawsuit against the National Review Online and the Competitive Enterprise Institute is "weakening the norms that make science robust." Mr. Pielke characterizes Prof. Mann's lawsuit as an improper attempt to "settle" a scientific debate through legal action, which Mr. Pielke claims deviates from Robert Merton's scientific norms. As one of the lawyers representing Mr. Mann, I can say confidently that nothing could be further from the truth.
Mr. Mann's lawsuit doesn't squelch scientific debate as his case isn't about science but rather the latest installment in a smear campaign to destroy his reputation through verifiably false and malicious assertions of fact about his professional conduct. The D.C. Court of Appeals affirmed Mr. Mann's right to proceed holding that "defamatory statements that are personal attacks on an individual's honesty and integrity . . . if false, do not enjoy constitutional protection and may be actionable." Nor do Merton's scientific norms prevent scientists, like all free people, from defending their good name through the courts if necessary. Mr. Pielke's invitation to muzzle scientists confronting ad hominem fallacies under the guise of "scientific debate" would strike a grievous blow at the institution of science by chilling free inquiry and thought, the bedrock of a vibrant scientific community. This notion is as true today as it was in 1937 Nazi Germany, which Merton wrote about in his "Science and the Social Order." Were Merton alive today he would reject Mr. Pielke's claim that science is stronger when scientists must turn the other cheek to attacks on their character.
Peter J. Fontaine
Philadelphia
---
Maybe Prof. Pielke is wrong. Maybe the scientific community should actually encourage the use of lawsuits to settle scientific debates, especially ones like climate change that have been politicized.
It is surprising that his article doesn't mention the infamous Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925, when a prevailing political view (fundamentalism) argued its case against the teaching of an alternative science (evolution). Weeks before the trial, the State of Tennessee had passed the Butler Act, which banned the teaching of evolution as anti-religion.
The trial focused the debate between competing theories. It was the first court proceeding to be carried live on radio. It pitted the most prominent advocates directly against one another. And it drew the lines between the two sides starkly and compellingly.
In the end, the public won. Now another scientific debate is preoccupying our national conversation. Perhaps it is time for another "monkey trial," this time between global warming and its deniers. Sometimes science is served best when it ventures beyond its norms.

Full text: Regarding Roger Pielke Jr.'s "A Litigious Climate Threatens Scientific Norms" (op-ed, Nov. 16): As a meteorologist specializing in numerical weather prediction (the computer models that make your daily weather forecasts), I, too, have "worked alongside climate researchers" since the 1990s.
Whereas Mr. Pielke finds climate scientists, in his excellent commentary on the dangers of taking scientific disagreements to the courts, "not particularly political," my observation is that many are very political and of these nearly all are left to hard-left of center.
Climate doesn't exist in the same way as weather. It is an abstraction subject to no specific physical law, and as a human idea climate can and is readily politicized to the point of becoming a matter of faith or belief.
If rain runoff can be taxed in Maryland, is it any wonder that the science of climate change wouldn't be litigated in the judiciary?

Full text: As tensions mount between President Donald Trump and his fiercest critics in Silicon Valley, Michael Kratsios has the thorny task of playing peacemaker.
Mr. Kratsios, one of the White House's top technology advisers, is developing a high-tech policy agenda that he says will spur innovation in emerging technologies such as drones and artificial intelligence.
"We are really working on issues that policy makers have never tackled before," Mr. Kratsios, the U.S. deputy chief technology officer, told The Wall Street Journal in his first major interview since his appointment in March. "It's just a question of putting smart people around a table and trying to come up with an innovative approach to regulating" new technologies, he said.
To do that, he will need to work closely with the science and tech communities -- some of the staunchest critics of Mr. Trump's policies. Leading scientists and tech executives have abandoned White House advisory councils and complained that the president's policies in areas like climate change and immigration threaten to reverse years of economic and social progress.
It may help that Mr. Kratsios, 31 years old, hails from the world of technology, having spent seven years as an executive at venture-capital firms founded by Silicon Valley luminary Peter Thiel. A former college intern for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), Mr. Kratsios said he hoped to eventually pursue a career in public service.
That opportunity came sooner than expected when Mr. Trump won the presidency last November, and Mr. Thiel -- one of the tech industry's most prominent supporters of the Republican -- brought Mr. Kratsios with him to New York to work on Mr. Trump's transition team.
Mr. Kratsios now oversees the tech team at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a department that helps the president shape a range of policies, from rural broadband access to space travel.
Tech leaders say they are engaging with Mr. Kratsios's office cautiously. Brad Smith, Microsoft Corp.'s president and chief legal officer and one of the most outspoken critics of President Trump's policies, said he is "committed to working constructively with OSTP and the administration more broadly on issues where we have common ground." In September, he appeared alongside Ivanka Trump in Virginia to help announce the administration's plans to bring more coding instruction to U.S. schools.
The Trump administration drew opposition from Silicon Valley when it took steps to dismantle the International Entrepreneur Rule, an immigration policy that President Barack Obama's tech advisers at the OSTP created to help foreign-born entrepreneurs stay in the U.S. to build startups. A group representing top venture-capital investors has sued the administration, claiming it took illegal steps to prevent the rule from being enacted.
Mr. Kratsios declined to comment on the International Entrepreneur Rule, but said he supports a merit-based immigration system "that encourages the world's best and brightest to come to the U.S. and build great technology companies."

Vacancies Abound
At Science Office
The White House has yet to nominate a director for the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a Senate-confirmed position. Michael Kratsios, who will report to the director as deputy, declined to reveal any candidate names or the timing of a nomination.
The vacancy of that and several other key OSTP positions, as well as a sluggish pace of hiring, has led to speculation in the science and tech communities that science is a low priority for the administration.
The office currently employs about 45 people, Mr. Kratsios said. He plans to grow the office to about 60 employees -- less than half the size of the office at its peak under the Obama administration. Mr. Kratsios said he thinks he can make more efficient use of fewer people, as the OSTP tends to rely heavily on the expertise of other federal agencies.
The nomination of an OSTP director, in particular, will be closely watched for its implications on U.S. climate-change policy.
A government report earlier this month drew a direct line between human activity and the quickening pace of climate change, a finding at odds with Mr. Trump's moves to reverse policies meant to combat climate change.
"The climate is changing, and I don't think anyone is disputing that," said Mr. Kratsios, who added that he aims to promote technology to reduce emissions.

Full text: It's unfortunate that Steven E. Koonin chose to wait until months after an extensive public review process to critique the Climate Science Special Report (CSSR), which he attacks in "A Deceptive New Report on Climate" (op-ed, Nov. 3).
Had he suggested further explanation of decadal variability in global mean sea-level rise during the review process, it might have been added by the authors. They might have noted that the rate of global sea-level rise today is likely faster than during its previous high in the 1930s-40s, also a period of relatively rapid temperature increase. Further, they might have noted the robust acceleration in sea level since 1900 that has been revealed by multiple analyses.
As a scientist and author on the Climate Science Special Report, I stand by its conclusions: The rate of global sea-level rise since 1900 has been faster than during any comparable period in at least 2,800 years. It has led to about seven to eight inches of global sea-level rise, about three inches of which have occurred since 1993. Human activities have contributed substantially to this high rate, which is a major contributor to the accelerating increase in tidal flooding in over two dozen Atlantic and Gulf Coast cities. One to four more inches of rise will likely occur over this century, depending in part on carbon-dioxide emissions, though levels as high as eight feet cannot be ruled out. The points that Mr. Koonin raises are minor comments about framing; the underlying scientific evidence is correct.

I am the former executive officer of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and National Research Council (1994-2011) and former Science and Technology Adviser to the U.S. Secretary of State (2011-14).
The quickest way to politicize scientific knowledge, what is known and not known, is to treat it as no different from other aspects of a contentious public-policy debate. Mr. Koonin's op-ed provides a good example. His so-called red team/blue team proposal for climate science would create two teams to debate scientific uncertainties and their significance. The teams would include nonscientists and scientists outside the relevant disciplines. This effort in effect becomes a political process with value judgments and no guarantee of an unbiased scientific assessment by the most highly qualified experts.
I commend the Trump administration for not trying to suppress the scientific judgments in the Climate Science Special Report, which are counter to the views of President Trump, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and others in the administration. If the Trump administration really wanted to know the current state of scientific knowledge related to climate change, all it has to do is read the reports of the National Academies as well as the CSSR.

The problem with analyzing data points in weather is that in aggregate they are not strictly ergodic (subject to mathematically predictable outcomes) but rather are emergent phenomena and therefore intrinsically unpredictable.
The middle ground in a healthy debate on climate change is to employ cost-effective measures to protect air and water safety first (e.g., Los Angeles and Flint, Mich.). Antagonists in the debate on how to respond to future environmental threats too often adopt a religious fervor that only confuses the public. Scientists should know better even if politicians don't.

Full text: A new U.S. government report drew a direct line between human activity and the quickening pace of climate change, saying the future emissions of greenhouse gasses will determine how warm the earth will get and how quickly sea levels will rise.
"The last three years have been the warmest years on record for the globe," according to the National Climate Assessment. "Many lines of evidence demonstrate that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century."
The report was produced by the Global Change Research Program, which is mandated by federal law to produce a comprehensive climate assessment. The report was crafted by scientists from 13 federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Energy Department, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The findings are based on scientific, peer-reviewed research, plus publicly available data sets and assessments of previous reports written by federal agencies, according to the report.
The report's statement that cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions could mitigate the expected rise in global temperatures comes as the Trump administration has rolled back efforts to limit emissions. President Donald Trump moved to pull the country from the Paris climate accord, the global push to slow carbon emissions, saying it stepped on U.S. sovereignty and constrained American industry.
Among its findings, the report also notes that the global average sea level has risen by about 7 to 8 inches since 1900, but nearly half of that increase has happened in the past 25 years or so. That is already affecting cities in the U.S. along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, where tidal flooding is becoming more commonplace, according to the report.
Looking ahead, the report says sea levels are expected to rise by at least several inches in the next 15 years and by 1 to 4 feet by 2100.
Average surface air temperature has increased by about 1.8 degrees F over the past 115 years, with recent years serving "record-breaking, climate-related extremes," according to the report. Heavy rains, heat waves, and forest fires are becoming more frequent, the report said.
Scientists have also observed changes in ocean temperatures, plus melting glaciers and diminishing snow cover and sea ice. On Wednesday, NASA published maps showing that two to four times as many of Greenland's coastal glaciers are at risk of accelerated melting as previously thought.
The change in climate will also affect human health and productivity, according to the report and other studies.
President Trump was an outspoken skeptic of climate change before he entered politics, calling it an "expensive hoax" and a concept invented by the Chinese. Since entering the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has largely avoided stating his position on the science.

Full text: PARIS -- French lender BNP Paribas SA said it would no longer finance shale and oil-sands projects, in one of the clearest signs yet the banking industry is re-evaluating its relationship with the oil sector amid mounting pressure from investors and governments over environmental issues.
France's largest listed bank said Wednesday that it would stop working with companies whose main business is the exploration, production, distribution or marketing of oil and gas from shale or oil sands.
"These measures will lead us to stop financing a significant number of players that don't further the transition toward an economy that emits less greenhouse gas," BNP Paribas Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafe wrote in a post on LinkedIn published Wednesday.
BNP Paribas is one of the first banks to eschew parts of the oil sector. Many governments are taking steps to curb emissions and investors have been increasing pressure on companies over their environmental footprints.
"Shareholders want to invest in companies that have a sustainable business model and are resilient in the event of new climate laws and regulation," said BNP Paribas's global head of corporate social responsibility, Laurence Pessez.
Earlier this year, a panel of top financial institutions and companies led by Michael Bloomberg published a series of guidelines pushing for companies to disclose more about the impact of climate change on their businesses.
"I think personally the writing is on the wall over the medium term for the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels," said Mark Lewis, a member of the panel. It is backed by the Financial Stability Board, a body that makes recommendations to the Group of 20 nations about financial regulation and policy.
"The banks will adapt like all other companies to changing economics and changing investor preference," Mr. Lewis added.
Exxon Mobil Corp. faced a shareholder revolt this spring as investors ignored management recommendations and voted in favor of a resolution calling for more information on how climate change and regulation could affect the company.
Still, there is little sign that the oil industry is facing difficulty raising money.
The shale oil sector has boomed over the last three years, despite a steep drop in oil prices. Most shale developments are in the U.S. where the Trump administration has rolled back tougher environmental regulation. U.S. companies also have access to a deep pool of investors and banks.
BNP Paribas has already made moves to reduce its financing of coal mines and coal-fired power plants and expand its investment in renewable energy.
Earlier this year, BNP Paribas said it wouldn't finance coal companies that aren't seeking to diversify their energy sources.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Some of the biggest U.S. power companies said they are pushing ahead with investments in renewable and gas-fired electricity and are including climate change as a part of their corporate strategy, regardless of the Trump administration's plans to roll back Obama-era environmental rules.
President Donald Trump has pledged to boost the energy industry by cutting regulation, and on Tuesday his administration took one of its biggest steps yet toward that goal. The head of the Environmental Protection Agency signed a proposal to repeal the first federal limits on carbon emissions at power plants, which would vacate the Obama administration's cornerstone plan to slow global warming.
Some sizable power companies, such as American Electric Power Co., NRG Energy Inc. and Southern Co., said Tuesday the move will have only a marginal effect on their planning. Cheap fuel, improving technology and consumer demand are creating a market for cleaner energy that is largely unaffected by what is happening in Washington.
But the move has symbolic and long-term implications. The Obama-era rules drew fire from Republicans and their allies in business who saw them as a prime example of government overreach.
The Trump administration argues that the Obama rules weren't allowed under the Clean Air Act -- an issue that will likely be argued in court for years. Environmentalists see the rules as crucial to accelerating a shift from carbon-based fuels to renewable-power sources.
Power-plant emissions are one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, and President Barack Obama's administration targeted them with limits outlined by the EPA's Clean Power Plan in 2015. The limits were the chief way for the country to comply with the Paris accords, a pact among international governments to slow global warming. Mr. Trump has now signaled his intent to reverse the U.S. position on both.
But a generational shift in the energy industry was happening long before that tug of war in federal government. Power plants cut their carbon dioxide by 25% between 2005 and 2016, a trend that is likely to continue, according to the Edison Electric Institute, an industry group.
Cheap natural gas from the shale-drilling boom and more-efficient power plants have run coal-burning rivals out of business. Advancements in wind and solar power, with help from subsidies, have cut emissions, too. And confronted with the risks of climate change and how governments might deal with it, power companies now expect the cost of carbon emissions to rise and plan on ways to reduce them.
"This will not change our planning process," a spokesman at Southern Co. said of the EPA's move on Tuesday.

Full text: The Trump administration is formally withdrawing federal limits on carbon emissions at power plants, triggering the next stage of what is likely to be a yearslong fight over the government's centerpiece regulation for slowing climate change.
The move pushes forward on a central pledge of President Donald Trump: a rollback of Obama-era environmental rules he has criticized for harming businesses and coal miners in particular. And it pushes the federal government further away from any effort to combat global warming, following Mr. Trump's June announcement that he intends to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said in Kentucky that he would sign a proposal Tuesday to reverse the rules. The announcement, made at an event organized by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) in the coal-mining town of Hazard, Ky., confirmed what many had expected for weeks.
"Repealing this Obama-era rule would close a chapter of regulatory overreach that set standards without regard to the steep costs or availability of technology necessary to meet them," Hal Quinn, chief executive of the National Mining Association, said in a statement applauding the decision.
Power-plant emissions are one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, and President Barack Obama's administration targeted them with limits outlined by the EPA's Clean Power Plan in 2015. The Obama limits became central to the country's ability to reduce emissions under the Paris accord.
But Mr. Trump, who has called global warming a "hoax," ordered a review of the Clean Power Plan in March. The EPA's review called the plan a legal overreach, and both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt have said it is burdensome to U.S. companies, and an unfair punishment for the fossil-fuel businesses to the benefit of wind- and solar-power producers.
"The past administration was unapologetic," Mr. Pruitt said during Monday's announcement. "They were using every bit of power, every bit of authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers in how we generate electricity in this country. And that's wrong."
The EPA's assessment under Mr. Pruitt calls the plan an unlawful expansion of the agency's authority under the Clean Air Act by holding power generators responsible for limiting emissions through control systems that work from outside of their sites, according to documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal last week.
Eliminating that requirement would be in line with what many industry officials wanted.
The American Petroleum Institute, the Washington lobbying group for U.S. oil and gas producers, called the Clean Power Plan flawed and said emissions were improving even without it.
"Market forces and technological innovation have driven the increased use of natural gas which has brought great benefits to American consumers, workers, and the environment," Jack Gerard, the group's chief executive, said in a statement.
Utility industry officials were reserving comment ahead of Mr. Pruitt's formal signing of the withdrawal Tuesday.
Mr. Pruitt's decision was met with swift opposition from both states and environmental groups. New York's attorney general said he would sue to stop the repeal and his California counterpart said he "will do everything in my power to defend the Clean Power Plan."
Environmental groups made similar promises and many experts have said they expect the Trump administration's actions to lead to years of rule-making procedure and litigation.
"The fight against this dangerous decision is only just beginning," the Sierra Club said in a statement. "Trump can't reverse our clean energy and climate progress with the stroke of a pen, and we'll fight him and Scott Pruitt at the state and local level across America."

Full text: States in a coalition adhering to the initial U.S. commitment to the Paris climate accord are on track to meet their environmental targets, despite the federal government planning to pull out the global pact, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday.
Earlier this year, President Donald Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris agreement in its current form, under which the U.S. pledged to reduce carbon emissions to combat climate change, along with other countries around the globe.
Mr. Cuomo subsequently co-founded the U.S. Climate Alliance with fellow Democratic governors Jerry Brown of California and Jay Inslee of Washington, who said they would stick with the agreement's carbon-reduction protocols.
Mr. Cuomo was joined on Wednesday at his Manhattan office by Messrs. Brown and Inslee, as well as former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, where they promoted the Climate Alliance and announced that North Carolina was now part of the 14-member group.
Mr. Trump, a Republican, has left the door open for renegotiating and staying in the global accord, but Mr. Cuomo, a potential 2020 presidential hopeful, said it wasn't worthwhile if the standards were less stringent.
"There's no reason to go backwards because we've proven we can meet these goals," Mr. Cuomo said.
Mr. Kerry said he hoped monetary aid the U.S. had pledged to developing countries as a part of the Paris accord could be replaced by private funds. That element of the accord hasn't been replicated by the state-level pact.

Full text: UNITED NATIONS -- The White House reiterated on Monday that the Trump administration's stance on the Paris climate accord hasn't changed, following signals over the weekend that the U.S. was exploring ways to remain in the 2015 pact.
"We are withdrawing from the Paris Agreement unless we can re-engage on terms more favorable to the United States. This position was made very clear," a senior White House official said after top Trump economic aide Gary Cohn hosted a closed-door meeting with about a dozen international climate-action representatives.
Monday's breakfast meeting in New York came on the heels of a ministerial gathering Saturday in Montreal, where, according to several participants, the U.S. broached revising its greenhouse-gas emissions targets instead of scrapping the deal.
Mr. Cohn, who is leading the White House's efforts on the climate pact, joins other top White House officials who in recent days expressed an openness to renew cooperation under the accord. But he hasn't laid out what modifications of the Paris accord would satisfy U.S. demands, according to officials familiar with the discussions.
"There was some confusion over the weekend and I think we removed all the confusion," Mr. Cohn said after his meeting. He didn't provide details beyond saying the meeting was "very constructive."
Canada, China and the European Union, which organized the Montreal gathering, have been leading an effort to bolster the Paris accord since Mr. Trump said in June that the U.S. would withdraw from the pact, citing sovereignty and economic concerns.
The president had, however, left an open door to renegotiate the agreement or broker an "entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States."
International heavyweights led by China and the EU have made clear that they won't engage in renegotiations of the Paris agreement. That leaves Mr. Trump with two options.
He could submit a written request at the end of a three-year no-exit period in November 2019, pulling the U.S. out after one year. Alternatively, he could revise U.S. commitments to reduce its nonbinding carbon-emission targets within the Paris accord.
According to an official familiar with the climate talks of recent days, Mr. Cohn told the participants that the "U.S. could remain in the Paris Agreement under the right conditions, but these are not there yet."

Full text: President Donald Trump's top economic adviser is expected to outline the administration's proposals to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions while restating that its stance on the Paris climate accord has not changed, White House officials said, following signals over the weekend that the U.S. was exploring ways to remain in the 2015 pact.
White House economic chief Gary Cohn's planned breakfast discussion on energy and climate matters in New York follows a similar meeting led by Canada, China and the European Union in Montreal on Saturday, when U.S. officials broached revising Washington's goals under the Paris accord to avoid pulling out of it, according to officials at the event.
Mr. Cohn, who is leading the White House's stance toward the 197-party accord, is set to discuss how the U.S. can continue to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions without sacrificing its re-emergence as a leading energy producer, according to a White House official. The initiative to hold an informal meeting in New York materialized shortly before the Montreal event, according to an invitation letter from Mr. Cohn, and it was interpreted by some U.S. partners as a harbinger of a policy shift.
Trump administration officials on Sunday confirmed the president remained open to revising U.S. commitments under the Paris accord rather than quitting the pact.
The White House has said such a position isn't a shift: Mr. Trump said in June that the U.S. would withdraw from the pact "but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or an. . .entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States."
But Mr. Trump has repeatedly boasted of withdrawing from what he has called a "job-killing" deal and hasn't emphasized revising the country's participation in the pact.
Asked Sunday by ABC News whether the U.S. could remain in the Paris pact, national security adviser H.R. McMaster said: "If there's an agreement that benefits the American people, certainly."
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told CBS News: "The president is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged."
Remarks by the top U.S. national-security official and diplomat reflected the message offered by the U.S. delegation, led by White House senior adviser Everett Eissenstat, to representatives from 34 governments in Montreal Saturday, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
Mr. Trump's envoy, who is deputy director of the National Economic Council, the White House office led by Mr. Cohn, said the U.S. couldn't carry forward with targets set by the Obama administration. Mr. Eissenstat said the White House continued its review of those commitments, the person said. In the meantime, the U.S. said it would participate in climate talks, remain active and be constructive, the person said.
Participants in Montreal said Mr. Eissenstat's remarks fueled optimism among proponents of the Paris deal. Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, officials from China, the EU and Canada have tried to convince his administration that fighting climate change could also prove an economic boon.
Businesses mostly declined to discuss the administration's position, while indicating it wouldn't affect clean-energy investments.
"Until we know more about the administration's thoughts and plans, FirstEnergy doesn't have anything to add," a spokeswoman for the Ohio-based electricity company said. Since the president's June announcement, companies have showed few signs of changing long-term strategies in the capital-intensive industries with decade-long planning horizons.
Many firms are shifting to less carbon-intensive fuels and renewable energy to satisfy customer preferences, and because these fuels have become less expensive and more competitive. Most also operate in multiple countries, including in jurisdictions still pursuing ambitious climate regulations.
"Reducing emissions cost effectively remains an important part of our strategy," said Neil Nissan, a spokesman for North Carolina power company Duke Energy, which plans to cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2030.
America's international partners will be looking for clarification during Mr. Cohn's briefing in New York, as world leaders arrive in the city for the United Nations General Assembly.
The Paris deal, brokered under a U.N. framework, is on the agenda as countries seek to meet their commitment to limit the global temperature increases to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. The U.S. wants to use the annual U.N. gathering to present its "softer vision" on the sidelines, according to one official who participated in the Montreal event.
Mr. Cohn is planning to exchange views on the path ahead, a White House official said, underlining that the U.S. was focused on reducing emissions by pursuing clean energy and other technological improvements. Mr. Cohn would point to areas where the U.S. had made such strides without sacrificing economic growth or energy security, the official said.
The U.S. delegation joined the Montreal discussions on climate change and clean energy, which spurred optimism about American engagement, one participant said. At the meeting, Mr. Eissenstat appeared to juggle the Trump administration's policy priorities on the Paris agreement, according to participants in the Montreal meeting.
"I was in the meeting, and effectively, the negotiator didn't close the door to remaining in the agreement, and in addition ruled out looking for a new agreement," Chilean Environment Minister Marcelo Mena said late Saturday in a tweet from Montreal.
Rep. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.), who has urged Mr. Trump to renegotiate U.S. commitments under the Paris accord, said Sunday that the White House told him the president's "position hasn't changed -- he still plans to withdraw unless we find more suitable terms."

Next Steps Unclear
On Climate Deal
President Donald Trump said in June that the U.S. would exit the Paris climate accord, while leaving open the possibility of renegotiating the deal or crafting an "entirely new transaction." In recent days, American officials said the U.S. could remain in the climate accord if it could revise its commitments. Here is a closer look at the Paris agreement and the process of withdrawing from it.
Technically, Mr. Trump can't pull the U.S. out of the agreement for several years.
Mr. Trump's June announcement was only the beginning of a multiyear process for extricating the U.S. from the deal. According to the agreement, countries can exit only three years after the effective date of the deal. That was Nov. 4, 2016. Once November 2019 comes, Mr. Trump could request to exit from the accord, and after that, the U.S. could be out as early as November 2020.
The level of U.S. commitment is nonbinding.
The Obama administration agreed to aim to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by the year 2025. Mr. Trump could ease that goal, which is voluntary, and make it less ambitious.
Renegotiation could be difficult.
Mr. Trump has said the U.S. could seek a new deal or try to reopen negotiations on the Paris agreement. But experts say such a process would be difficult, because nearly all nations agreed on the pact in 2015, and leading economies have said they would continue with the original deal if the U.S. leaves.
The administration has sent mixed signals.
Trump advisers told a group of climate officials in Montreal on Saturday the U.S. could remain engaged in the Paris accord. In June, Mr. Trump said the U.S. would seek to renegotiate on "terms that are fair." But Mr. Trump has boasted of withdrawing the U.S., making no mention of revising U.S. participation.
A future administration could rejoin the agreement.
Environmental groups say the Paris agreement was designed to be durable and withstand shifts in climate politics.

Full text: President Donald Trump will arrive at his first United Nations General Assembly next week looking to rally world leaders to contain the nuclear ambitions of North Korea, increase pressure on Iran and combat Islamic State.
His speech, scheduled for Tuesday, comes as the U.S. seeks to maintain pressure on North Korea after its most recent missile launch Friday.
Mr. Trump, who has described the U.N. as an "underperformer" and criticized what he believes to be its anti-Israel bias, has held up the Security Council's recent 15-0 vote to increase sanctions on North Korea as a major win.
"Very big financial impact!" he tweeted last month.
But he also has questioned whether sanctions will be enough to deter the country's leader, Kim Jong Un. The latest missile test could also fray the relationship at the U.N. between the U.S., China and Russia; the U.S. has said it wants China to do more in restraining North Korea, and China and Russia have criticized U.S. rhetoric.
U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who said she has reviewed a draft of Mr. Trump's speech, said she expects the president to be well received. "He slaps the right people, hugs the right people and comes out with the U.S. being very strong at the end," she said.
The 2015 Iranian nuclear deal is also expected to be a subject for the general assembly meeting next week, said H.R. McMaster, national security adviser. Mr. Trump has threatened to end the deal, though the U.S. recently declared Tehran in compliance.
Other world leaders who signed on -- the U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia -- have little interest in returning to the negotiating table.
Mr. Trump has already proposed deep cuts to the U.N.'s $5.4 billion annual budget.
Mr. Trump will meet for the first time with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday at an event hosted by Mr. Trump on reforming the U.N.
One focus of the General Assembly will be U.N. efforts to demonstrate a renewed global commitment to combating climate change, largely in response to Mr. Trump's announcement in June that he plans to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Paris Climate Accord.
The U.S. administration will be absent from two major events centered on climate change next week, according to U.N. officials.
Gen. McMaster said Friday that Mr. Trump's speech will "emphasize the need for states to promote peace and prosperity while upholding sovereignty and accountability as indispensable foundations of international order."
Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a series of talks with world leaders during the rest of the week, though three of the most important world leaders won't be attending: Germany's Angela Merkel, China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin.

Full text: CLIMATE CHANGE
White House Faces
Deadline on Report
The Trump administration faces a deadline at the end of next week on whether to approve a scientific report that verifies climate change and attributes it to humans, a position that contradicts some of the rhetoric the president used during his 2016 campaign.
The White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy is supposed to decide by Aug. 18 whether to approve or recommend changes to the "Climate Change Special Report," the research on climate science that feeds its National Climate Assessment.
The scientific draft has been through several versions, one publicly available since late last year. The New York Times reported about the latest draft on Tuesday.

SEPT. 11 ATTACKS
Court Bars Judge
From Hearing Case
A federal appeals court barred a military-commissions appeals judge from hearing a key case on the Sept. 11 terror attacks, finding that his comments to the news media suggested he was biased against the defendants.
In a seven-page opinion Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit also threw out a pro-government ruling in which the judge, Scott Silliman of the Court of Military Commission Review, took part in July.
The D.C. Circuit decision is the latest setback for the government's 16-year effort, begun soon after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, to create a system separate from the federal courts and courts-martial that can prosecute suspected terrorists without affording them constitutional rights.
Judge Silliman said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the decision. David Nevin, an attorney for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of the defendants and the alleged mastermind behind the Sept. 11 attacks, declined to comment. The Justice and Defense departments also had no comment.

EDUCATION
DeVos Discusses
Black Colleges
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos distanced herself on Wednesday from her comment earlier this year about the nation's historically black colleges and universities being pioneers of school choice, saying that in the past "there were no choices" for African-Americans in higher education.
"When I talked about it being a pioneer in choice it was because I acknowledge that racism was rampant and there were no choices," Ms. DeVos said in an interview. "These HBCUs provided choices for black students that they didn't have."

Full text: Dear Dan,
We try to set boundaries on phone and computer use by our teenagers, who are supposed to stop using their devices by 9 p.m.â[euro]¯But my husband stays on his phone long after that, researching vacations or kitchen appliances -- which, to my mind, is a clear double standard. Am I right?
-- Tina
I'm with you: Setting a bad personal example isn't a great way to encourage good behavior in your teens. I would pressure your husband to be a better role model. Or you could just turn off the Wi-Fi router after 9 p.m., which would make it difficult to go online (at least without a strong cellular connection). It is hard to resist temptation when giving in is so easy -- in this case, when the internet is just a click away. By creating roadblocks, even small ones like turning a router back on, we can create a natural pause for reflection that should encourage better decisions.
The only downside is that, with all the free time your husband will now have, he might want to spend it with you. Are you ready for this?
Dear Dan,
How can some people see global warming as a huge crisis facing humanity while others dismiss it as a big red herring? Why do Republicans and Democrats reach such different conclusions reading the same data? Can ideologies really lead to such strong biases in the way that we look at the world?
-- Rachel
Ideology can easily color our views, even on scientific data. In much the same way that Israelis and Palestinians can see the same clash and place the blame entirely differently, so too can political ideology taint almost everything we experience. And, of course, people with different ideologies don't read the same information: We largely pick the information outlets that support our initial beliefs, making it even easier to become convinced that we are correct.
This sort of biased interpretation of data isn't the end of it, though. As Troy Campbell and Aaron Kay showed in a 2014 paper in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, "an aversion to the solutions associated with the problem" can color our view of the problem itself.
When the researchers exposed participants to solutions to global warming based on more government regulation, those who supported free-market ideologies were much less likely to acknowledge the hazards of climate change. On the other hand, when the researchers proposed solutions based on less government regulation and more autonomy for private enterprise, these same participants were much more likely to see the dangers of global warming.
That suggests one way forward: Don't just shove more data in people's faces and ask them why they won't face up to reality, but work on solutions that align with a wide variety of ideologies.
Dear Dan,
I fly a lot for work, and my annoyance with air travel is rising all the time. These days, I get upset the night before a flight just from knowing I have to head for the airport the next day. What can I do to reduce my distaste for flying?
-- David
Learn more about the physics of flying and the complexity of the operational side of managing a large airline. We are quick to take things for granted. We get wondrous new technologies such as Google and quickly stop being impressed; we get clean, running water in our homes and stop being amazed. By reminding yourself every time you get to an airport about the marvels of flight and the difficulty of running a big transportation company, you will focus on the full experience -- and enjoy it much more.

Full text: In "Climate Change Isn't the End of the World" (op-ed, July 31), David Henderson and John Cochrane argue that climate-change policy should follow careful economic analysis. Yet, their suggested form of analysis outside their narrow model. Already counted in the hundreds of thousands a year are deaths associated with crop failures and food scarcity, heat waves and forced relocation. The several-year East African drought may be a harbinger of what's to come. Malaria, Zika and dengue among other diseases spread as a warmer climate extends the range mosquitoes travel.
The authors' analysis neglects environmental damage and ecosystem disruption that enters a spiraling feedback loop. Even if you do not believe that humans have a responsibility to stewards of the earth, certainly the damage to systems that support human life should be factored into the equation.

War, disease and chaos are exactly the stresses to which unchecked climate change will lead. Environmental degradation caused by climate change will drive food shortages, disease, migrations and wars. Even Defense Secretary James Mattis stated in his congressional testimony that "climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today."

To assert that carbon dioxide "hurts nobody's health" is ignorant. Humans exhale carbon dioxide as a waste product. C02 is linked to myriad deleterious health ailments including respiratory conditions. As a greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide also traps heat in the atmosphere, which contributes to the rising sea level and disrupts weather patterns.

Billions of years of evolution have created a perfectly balanced ecosystem that sustains life as we know it. Extracting and burning fossil fuel, along with deforestation, disrupts that critical balance.
The authors note that pollution and declining wildlife habitats are problems, but they fail to connect these to climate change. The policies that cause climate change also cause pollution and loss of habitats. Fracking emits volatile organic compounds. Pipelines carrying fuel and fracking chemicals leak into waterways and aquifers, and pipeline compressors emit toxins into the air. Habitats are being lost everyday to fossil-fuel drilling. Focusing only on the economics of climate change is fundamentally flawed.

Examining data over the past 21 centuries we see that sometimes we have experienced more-than-average warming and sometimes more-than-average cooling. That fact makes me suspect that eliminating activities that generate CO2 will not do away with climate change.
There is a lot of uncertainty regarding the benefits of fighting climate change, but there is more certainty about the costs. Proponents of the Paris agreement estimate that full compliance would reduce the global temperature by 0.17 degrees Celsius by 2100, but that's hardly worth the cost. There is no use being Don Quixotes fighting windmills.

Full text: SAN FRANCISCO -- California Gov. Jerry Brown scored a major win for his climate-change agenda when the Legislature approved an extension of the state's cap-and-trade program.
Mr. Brown had struggled to get Democrats on board, with some more business-friendly members concerned about the program's effect on jobs and some environmentalists objecting that it gives too much to industry. Under the program, California businesses pay for the carbon dioxide they emit while reducing the emissions over time. The state's goal is to cut emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.
In the end, some Republican members -- enticed by measures such as a tax break for manufacturers and a fee waiver for rural residents -- joined Democrats Monday to extend the program from 2020 through 2030. One Republican backed the measure in the Senate's 28-12 vote, and seven Republicans supported it in the Assembly's 55-22 vote. The GOP votes in the Assembly were critical to reach the two-thirds majority required for new tax measures.
"Tonight, California stood tall, and once again boldly confronted the existential threat of our time," Mr. Brown said shortly after the vote. "Republicans and Democrats set aside their differences, came together and took courageous action. That's what good government looks like."
Some Republicans sharply criticized the program, though, saying it will drive up gas prices and utility bills for California consumers.
"Mark my words, today is the start of the next great California recession," said Sen. Ted Gaines, a Republican representing 11 rural counties in the state's northeast. "I can't support this bill. I am going to protect California's poor and the working class, not double their fuel costs."
Monday's two-thirds margin should insulate the program from further legal challenges like the one brought earlier by the California Chamber of Commerce. It sued, arguing cap and trade is an illegal tax on businesses, but the program was upheld by a state appeals court in April, and the California Supreme Court last month declined to hear an appeal.
After the loss, the Chamber backed cap and trade as a better option than more-onerous regulations. Last week, it endorsed the governor's plan.
The legislative victory is a boost for Mr. Brown, who has played the role of global-warming crusader abroad but has struggled to enact pieces of his climate agenda back home. In pushing the program last Thursday, the Democratic governor warned of an apocalyptic future if climate change continues.
California began using a cap-and-trade program to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in 2013. The state imposes a limit on the CO2 that industry is allowed to release and then auctions or gives away permits for those emissions. Businesses are free to sell permits they don't need, allowing market forces to distribute and price these allowances.
Money from the quarterly auctions, so far totaling $4.9 billion, will also go toward a state fund used for projects that include one of Mr. Brown's priorities: a high-speed rail train from Los Angeles to San Francisco.
State Sen. Tom Berryhill, of Twain Harte, Calif., the lone Republican in the state Senate to support the cap-and-trade measure, said the protections for small-business owners and rural Californians -- and his belief that the program is preferable to more-direct regulation -- won his vote. "Cap and trade fills a void created by onerous policies, a void that would otherwise be filled by regulations written by out-of-touch, unaccountable bureaucrats," Mr. Berryhill said.

Full text: SAN FRANCISCO -- California Gov. Jerry Brown may have seized the role as a global-warming crusader abroad, but back home he is struggling to unite fellow Democrats and environmentalists around a key piece of his climate-change agenda.
Mr. Brown wants the state Legislature to extend California's cap-and-trade program, which requires businesses here to pay for their carbon-dioxide emissions while also reducing those emissions over time. The extension would be from 2020 through 2030.
Facing a key test on his home turf after pledging to defy Republican President Donald Trump on climate change, Mr. Brown gave a full-throated endorsement of the program Thursday.
Turning to the audience of a packed Sacramento committee room and shouting, the 79-year-old governor warned of a potentially apocalyptic future if climate change continued unabated, with vector-borne diseases, mass migrations, forest fires and a "Southern California burning up."
"That's real guys -- that is what the scientists of the world are saying, so I am not here about some cockamamie legacy that people talk about," Mr. Brown said. "This isn't for me -- I am going to be dead! It is for you!"
The program -- a key aspect the state hopes to use to reduce CO2 emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 -- has facedquestionsas business groups have criticized it as an unconstitutional tax on industry. An attempt to extend the program last month failed because of a lack of Democratic support.
The California Chamber of Commerce and the Pacific Legal Foundation had sued the state, saying the program was an illegal tax on businesses. A state appeals court rejected their arguments in April, and the California Supreme Court left that decision in place last month.
The state's Chamber of Commerce now supports a cap-and-trade program as an alternative to more direct regulations. The chamber endorsed the governor's plan on Thursday, saying it "will provide the least costly path to achieving our climate goals."
Mr. Brown wants to insulate the program from future legal challenges by achieving a two-thirds vote of approval in the Legislature -- the threshold for all new taxes in the state. But he is struggling to get Democrats on board, with some more business-friendly members concerned about the effects on jobs.
Environmentalists are also raising objections.
Amy Vanderwarker, co-director of the California Environmental Justice Alliance, which advocates for environmental policies aimed at low-income and minority communities, said she opposed the plan.
"We feel like the proposal put forward is actually a step backward for California climate policy, with way too many loopholes for industry that actually make it harder to achieve our 2030 targets," she said.

Establishing a Price
Helps Cut Emissions
Determining a price for greenhouse gas emissions has been a goal of certain economists for years as a means of curbing those emissions, which most scientists believe contribute to global warming.
The argument is that by putting a price on emissions, industry can factor those costs into production and search for greener alternatives.
There are various methods for pricing emissions of carbon dioxide, but the most widely discussed are a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade system.
In 2013, California began using a cap-and-trade program to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Under cap and trade, the state imposes a limit on the amount of CO2 that can be released by industry and then issues a finite number of permits for emissions. Those permits are auctioned or given away.
Businesses under nearly every industry are covered, including refineries, food processors, manufacturers and utilities.
Businesses are free to sell excess permits that they don't need, allowing market forces to distribute and price these allowances. Futures and options to buy California's carbon allowances can be traded on the Intercontinental Exchange.

Full text: Scientists reported Wednesday that a 1 trillion-ton iceberg nearly the size of the state of Delaware broke off the Antarctic Peninsula, changing the continent's landscape in one of the largest such "calving" events in recent history.
Experts say the new iceberg -- at 2,240 square miles, or 12% of the total ice shelf from which it came -- won't lead to rising sea levels because the same amount of mass was already submerged in the water.
But they worry about what it means for the floating ice shelf from which it came, called Larsen C, and whether the calving might herald a growing vulnerability to the warmer temperatures associated with climate change.
"Antarctica has lost area by a huge amount," said Martin O'Leary, a scientist at Swansea University in the U.K. who is part of a European project focused on studying Western Antarctica.
Two ice shelves, Larsen A and Larsen B, have previously collapsed. Larsen C could be next, according to scientists. In 2000, a larger chunk splintered off the Ross Ice Shelf on the Western edge of Antarctica to the south of the Larsens.
It is unclear whether climate change contributed to the rift that developed recently in Larsen C and the eventual calving of the new iceberg.
"People are pretty hesitant to say this is for sure related to climate change," said Kelly Brunt, a glaciologist at the University of Maryland and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
While it is "way outside" the average size of other observed calving events, scientists haven't observed telltale signs of warming-induced changes, like melt ponds, she said.
Still, there is concern. If "there's less of it, smaller [environmental] changes can have larger effects," Dr. O'Leary said. "Big ice shelves tend to be more stable."
Collapse of an entire ice shelf generally can be more problematic for sea levels because the shelves help prevent ice from the continent's interior creeping toward the edge and into the sea, scientists say.
Dr. Brunt said the glaciers held back by Larsen C originate from a mountain range and are relatively small. So in this case, she said, the potential effects on sea-level rise from ice accelerating toward the ocean would be "nothing to lose sleep over" should Larsen C collapse.
Other scientists are less sanguine. "In the next decades, we will likely see more icebergs from Larsen C and eventually it will reach a point of no return, break up in a domino effect and unleash massive discharge of land ice into the ocean," said Eric Rignot, a scientist at the University of California, Irvine.

World News: Trump Breaks With Global Leaders --- President clashes with counterparts over trade and climate at the G-20 summit

Full text: HAMBURG -- President Donald Trump faced off with world leaders over trade policy on Friday, positioning the U.S. as the most vocal critic of the international economic order and leaving it largely isolated.
The Group of 20 summit, long a platform to tackle common problems for leaders presiding over 80% of the world economy, split in two at its outset, with Mr. Trump adopting defiant opening positions toward the rest of a group largely united on the issues of trade and climate change.
Mr. Trump told the G-20 leaders in the closed-door meeting that they were "largely responsible" for the U.S.'s trade deficit, according to an official. China alone is responsible for about two-thirds of the U.S. trade deficit. European Union leaders bluntly warned the president that they would retaliate against protectionist measures from Washington.
"The vast majority pointed out that we need free, but also fair, trade," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, seeking to reconcile the two positions. The U.S. has emphasized "fair" trade in contrast to past official language focusing on open markets.
"The discussions on this are very difficult," Ms. Merkel said.
Disagreements deepened a G-20 schism that officials had flagged before the two-day gathering. Mr. Trump's critical stance toward international initiatives largely isolated the U.S., while the remaining 19 pushed for more cooperation, according to people at the discussions.
The first day of the two-day summit paved the way for what is likely to be a bland joint communique that papers over deep rifts on two core issues of the meeting -- trade and climate change -- and testament to the American retreat from the global consensus since Mr. Trump's election.
With the global economic recovery slowly taking hold, some G-20 members urged the group to also tackle international crises from migration to the inequality wrought by globalization.
The unusual level of international tensions surrounding this year's gathering -- and the attendance of polarizing leaders, from Russia's Vladimir Putin to Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- were mirrored in the streets of Hamburg, where violent protesters set cars on fire and clashed with police for a second day as Ms. Merkel greeted arriving heads of state.
Before his arrival at the G-20 summit, Mr. Trump told a cheering crowd Thursday in Poland that the West must fight existential threats and uphold its values. His address signaled a shift from May, when Mr. Trump withheld an unequivocal commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's defense during the alliance's summit.
"We've been waiting for a long time to hear these words from President Trump, but the real question is whether it was a one-time incident or a new policy," European Council President Donald Tusk said Friday as the gathering began.
Initial signs weren't encouraging to some of the summit participants.
For Mr. Trump, fair trade means erasing the U.S. trade deficit with G-20 countries, and that position "drastically differed from all others," Russian Economic Development Minister Maxim Oreshkin said.
The White House has pledged to unilaterally rebalance what it brands as unfair bilateral terms of trade, in contrast with the rest of the G-20 countries that advocate for global platforms to resolve imbalances.
"The right course is a lack of protectionism; we have to ensure that we move together resolutely," European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said, citing the EU and Japan's landmark trade agreement on Thursday as an example of the way forward.

Full text: BERLIN -- A meeting of world leaders in Germany next week emerged as a source of tension between allies on Thursday as Chancellor Angela Merkel sought to block the Turkish president from giving a speech in Germany and European leaders ratcheted up their criticism of President Donald Trump.
Ms. Merkel and her government delivered broadsides against both Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had wanted to give a speech on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg next week, and Mr. Trump's positions on climate and trade policy.
Speaking to the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, Ms. Merkel criticized the U.S. for abandoning the Paris climate accord and warned of difficult talks.
"We want to and must master this existential challenge, and we cannot and will not wait until every last person in the world has been successfully convinced of the scientific findings about climate change," Ms. Merkel said. "Those who believe they can solve the problems of this world with isolationism and protectionism are making a huge error."
Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Trump will join Ms. Merkel and other leaders of 20 large economies at the two-day annual summit that starts on July 7. While much of the anticipation in the U.S. has focused on Mr. Trump's likely first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, European leaders hope to use the summit to present Mr. Trump with a united front backing the Paris climate accord and opposing new trade barriers.
"The G-20 summit takes place in especially challenging conditions this year," Ms. Merkel said. "The world is in turbulence. It has become less united."
Ms. Merkel is not only girding for difficult talks with Mr. Trump, but also preparing for potentially violent protests. Mr. Erdogan, in particular, is a divisive figure in Germany's large Turkish diaspora.
Ms. Merkel's foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said Thursday the Turkish president had notified Germany of plans to deliver a speech to supporters on the sidelines of the summit. Such an appearance, Mr. Gabriel warned, was "not possible" and risked inciting conflict within Germany's large community of people of Turkish descent.
Ms. Merkel backed Mr. Gabriel's position, her spokesman said.
"The Turkish people who live in Germany are part of our society," Mr. Gabriel said while on a visit to Russia. "We do not want these people stirred up through conflicts in their home country."
Relations between Germany and Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally, have deteriorated since last summer's aborted coup in Turkey.
Tensions escalated this year after Turkey detained a prominent German-Turkish journalist, Turkish officials were barred from holding political rallies in Germany, Berlin granted asylum to Turkish military officers wanted in connection with the failed coup, and Turkey barred German lawmakers from visiting German troops stationed in Turkey.

Full text: LONDON -- A panel of top financial institutions and companies has launched guidelines to push for more disclosure about the impact of climate change, highlighting rising concern about the potential investment risks posed by global warming.
The task force, which was commissioned by a group of global regulators known as the Financial Stability Board and led by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said companies should disclose in financial filings how they are planning for risks and opportunities related to climate change. It also called for companies to develop specific metrics and targets to measure performance in that area.
The task force included executives from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Unilever PLC, miner BHP Billiton Ltd. and other large companies.
Climate-change risks are a concern for financial institutions and big companies, which fear both global warming itself and the regulatory threat from governments seeking to lessen its impact.
The recommendations have the support of over 100 companies, whose joint market capitalization totals more than $3.3 trillion, and financial firms responsible for more than $24 trillion in assets, the task force said. The report will be presented to the Group of 20 industrial and developing nations in July.
"Transparency is increasingly important to our consumers," said Graeme Pitkethly, chief financial officer at Unilever and a vice chairman on the task force. "They want to know the values of the companies they are buying from, particularly millennials."
Not everyone has welcomed the panel's work. A recent report by IHS Markit, funded by oil companies including BP PLC, Chevron Corp. and Total SA, warned that recommendations contained in an earlier draft of the report "could obscure material information and create a false sense of certainty around the financial implications of climate-related risks."
The report, which took over a year to complete, says all public companies should disclose more. However, the panel singled out the energy industry as one of four sectors most at risk from climate change that should consider providing more information to investors.
In May, Exxon Mobil Corp. faced a revolt when 62% of voting shareholders approved a resolution calling for more information on how climate change and regulation could affect the company. Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said the company would step back and reflect on how it could better express its position. Exxon declined to comment on the new report Wednesday.
Following a similar vote in 2016, Chevron published a report on its approach to managing climate risks in March this year. The company said it used a similar framework to the one recommended by Mr. Bloomberg's task force.

Pollution Used to Mean More Than Just CO2

Abstract: A regrettable outcome of the media-hogging climate-change debate is that the measure of pollution by nations has been reduced to carbon-dioxide emissions, a rather benign compound apart from its relationship to climate change.

Full text: A regrettable outcome of the media-hogging climate-change debate is that the measure of pollution by nations has been reduced to carbon-dioxide emissions, a rather benign compound apart from its relationship to climate change. In "The Charade of the Paris Treaty" (Review, June 17) Bjorn Lomborg succumbs to this myopic view when he states that President Trump "failed to acknowledge that global warming is real and wrongly claimed that China and India are the 'world's leading polluters.'" Mr. Trump is actually on to something if we were to broaden the definition of pollution, as we once did, to include polluting chemicals that contaminate water, air and the land, including habitats. Nations like China and India are among the most egregious polluters when this more liberal and comprehensive definition of pollution is applied.

The real problem with global accords on climate change isn't that they would make no meaningful difference but rather the lack of education for ourselves, others and future generations on the reality of climate change. The Paris treaty is the beginning of a modern global discussion on climate change, not the end. It sparked conversations at dinner tables about our individual environmental impacts as well as our collective global ambitions.
The points brought to light by Mr. Lomborg aren't incorrect but should be reserved for the next level of climate-change discussion. While the science of the Paris treaty may not satisfy the most ardent environmentalists, the treaty itself was a strong step in the right direction by the leading global carbon producer. I believe the Paris treaty and other global accords provide the platform and inspiration for technological advancements to emerge and revolutionize our perspective on energy.

Mr. Lomborg correctly notes that the first round of pledges will fall far short of the stated goal of 2 degrees Celsius, and cites the failed Kyoto Protocol as evidence for Paris's likely failure, but he misconstrues the long-term logic of the agreement, as well as the way in which Paris is importantly different from Kyoto. First, every five years pledges are reviewed and ratcheted up, aiming to foster trust, cooperation and peer pressure between parties and gradually build toward more ambitious targets. Also, Kyoto had binding emissions cuts, whereas Paris has voluntary commitments to allow flexibility to account for countries' political and economic feasibility constraints.
The global energy economy is an aircraft carrier, not a speedboat. The point of Paris is to create a sea change in how countries think about climate: to see it as deeply tied to their economic and geopolitical interests so that they begin to invest more in renewables and put a price on carbon. Mr. Lomborg ignores the geopolitical dimension of Paris. The Obama administration's most important strategic diplomatic achievement was to elevate climate to the same status as core issues in international cooperation, such as trade and security. In the new reality, if you're a bad actor on climate, countries can leverage this against you and make it harder for you to get what you want on a range of issues.

World News: Modi, Trump Seek to Redefine Relations --- Differences on trade, immigration and climate loom over Monday's discussions

Abstract: When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits the White House on Monday for his first meeting with President Donald Trump, a principle that has long underpinned relations will be at stake: that supporting the growth of a strong India is in America's national interest.

Full text: When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits the White House on Monday for his first meeting with President Donald Trump, a principle that has long underpinned relations will be at stake: that supporting the growth of a strong India is in America's national interest.
Mr. Trump will use the talks to "really expand his knowledge base about India and understand the importance of the Indian relationship," a senior White House official said. The Trump administration, the official said, will "roll out the red carpet" for Mr. Modi, setting an upbeat tone for the meeting.
But differences over immigration, trade and climate -- topics that animated Mr. Trump's "America First" slogan -- have the potential to strain relations that have been prone to rough patches. If Mr. Trump takes a more transactional stance than his predecessors, ties could hinge on India's ability to create American jobs or contribute more to maritime security.
Since the final years of Bill Clinton's presidency, U.S. leaders have chipped away at the history of distrust with India, which leaned toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War. President George W. Bush broke down barriers by championing a 2008 landmark nuclear agreement with New Delhi. President Barack Obama called the U.S.-India relationship "one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century" and strategic and defense cooperation between the countries grew under him, fueled by a shared wariness of China.
Mr. Trump, in a post-inauguration phone call with Mr. Modi in January, called India a "true friend," the White House said at the time. He sees India as a critical partner for stability in the Asia-Pacific region, which is being reshaped by China's rise, and for economic growth, the White House official said.
Indian officials said the meeting would be an opportunity for the leaders to get to know each other. Both have promised economic programs rooted in increasing manufacturing in their countries, and have ridden waves of nationalistic sentiment to shake up politics at home.
As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump assailed the skilled-worker visa program used by hundreds of thousands of Indians employed in the U.S. In office, he has ordered a review, saying the so-called H-1B visas should only be granted to the "most-skilled and the highest-paid" applicants to avoid crowding out American workers.
Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in March said H-1B visas help the U.S. economy's competitiveness and that India had conveyed its views on the subject to the Trump administration.
The White House official said there was no plan to discuss the visas during Mr. Modi's visit, but that issues relating to climate change may arise. Mr. Modi backs the Paris climate agreement from which Mr. Trump is withdrawing. This month, Mr. Trump said India made its participation in the deal contingent on receiving billions of dollars from developed nations, something New Delhi refuted.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last Wednesday that officials were working with Indian counterparts to address U.S. concerns about India's intellectual-property standards and barriers to foreign direct investment.
Monday's talks will have a particular focus on regional security and defense collaboration, Indian officials said. These were engines of growth under Mr. Obama as New Delhi emerged as a leading buyer of U.S. arms, and China began altering the balance of power in Asia. Although India remains opposed to a formal security alliance with the U.S., Mr. Modi, who built a personal rapport with Mr. Obama, embraced Washington more than Indian leaders before him.

Full text: EUROPEAN UNION
Divisions Hobble Bid
To Lead Climate Deal
EU governments clashed over joint efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, highlighting the challenges facing the bloc as it vies to lead the global fight against climate change.
Environment ministers from the EU's 28 members on Monday struggled to bridge divides on legislation to cut emissions. Some pushed for carbon subsidies to help plug national shortcomings, while others warned such measures would undermine the bloc's Paris Agreement commitments.
The EU's internal squabbles come less than three weeks after President Donald Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of the global accord to halt climate change, providing an opening for Brussels to become the Paris deal's principal advocate.
"More than ever, there is a need for a strong signal from the European Union that we are ready to lead the way," Miguel Arias Canete, European commissioner for climate action and energy, told the gathering of the bloc's environment ministers.

SOUTH KOREA
Seoul Powers Down
Nuclear-Plant Sector
South Korea said it would scrap plans to build new nuclear-power plants and halt operation of the country's oldest reactor, marking a shift for a nation that ranks among the most reliant on atomic energy.
President Moon Jae-in, the left-leaning leader elected last month, said Monday that he would permanently end operations at the Kori-1 reactor, which went online in 1978, at midnight on Sunday.
"The permanent shutdown of the Kori-1 nuclear reactor is the first step toward a nuclear-free state and a paradigm shift to a safer Korea," Mr. Moon said. "I will review nuclear-reactor policy in full measure and scrap all the existing plans to build new nuclear reactors and will not extend the lifespan of current ones."

PHILIPPINES
Southeast Asian
Sea Patrols Begin
Three Southeast Asian nations under threat from Islamic State-linked militants launched joint maritime patrols in an effort to stop a conflict in the southern Philippines from spreading to other parts of the region.
The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia plan to police the Sulu and Celebes seas, a vast area prone to piracy and kidnappings.
The conflict in the southern Philippines, now entering its fifth week, is raising concerns in Jakarta that militants could flee to neighboring Indonesian islands.
The joint patrols were first agreed to more than a year ago, but were delayed over disputes such as overlapping territorial claims, said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.

Full text:   BEIJING -- China is working to keep climate-change cooperation with the U.S. alive after President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, even if that means sidestepping the White House to seek closer ties with U.S. states.
Meetings in Beijing during the past week showed the competing agendas in U.S. energy politics and deep frustration inside China's government over Mr. Trump's decision to abandon what had been a rare platform for unity in the U.S.-China relationship.
China rolled out the red carpet for California Gov. Jerry Brown, a critic of Mr. Trump's decision who arrived in China the first weekend in June to take part in an international clean-energy forum and meet provincial officials. It was Mr. Brown that President Xi Jinping later welcomed to Beijing's Great Hall of the People; U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, also in town for the forum, was received by a vice premier.
Chinese officials expressed dismay with Mr. Trump's decision. "I am so deeply disappointed," said Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, during a gathering with Mr. Brown.
Since Mr. Trump's decision, a coalition of a dozen U.S. states, including California, have committed to uphold America's pledge to cut emissions 26% to 28% compared with 2005 levels.
For Beijing, working with U.S. states could burnish the image the country has sought to cultivate as an emerging global leader on climate issues. Some states can also share emissions-cutting expertise that leaders here are eager to acquire.
Mr. Xi sent perhaps the strongest signal that he hopes to see more local-level cooperation by meeting Mr. Brown.
Among the agreements Mr. Brown's office announced during the week included plans to coordinate emission-reduction programs with China's Ministry of Science and Technology and to set up a joint climate research institute between California and China's Tsinghua University.
China is encouraging "all relevant parties to implement the Paris agreement," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Friday when asked about Mr. Brown's visit.
Local U.S.-China cooperation has limits: National governments are needed to negotiate deals keeping world leaders marching in the same direction. Lacking a U.S. commitment, Mr. Xie, the Chinese climate envoy, used a gathering at Tsinghua University to urge U.S. and Chinese scientists and business leaders to step up cooperation.
Mr. Brown said he hopes more states and cities will join him in opposing Mr. Trump's stance. "With Trump saying no, it's up to states and localities to say yes -- and they're doing that," he said.
Mr. Perry said he supported the rights of states to choose their own paths. "My hat's off to Gov. Brown for the work that he does to promote California," he said in Beijing on Friday. He said he faced no pressure from those he met for the U.S. to change its mind about leaving the Paris deal.
Mr. Perry's arrival in China early in the week was preceded by the surprise announcement last Monday by the top U.S. diplomat in China, David Rank, that he was quitting to protest against Mr. Trump's climate position. Mr. Rank, who was charge d'affaires, had been expected to accompany Mr. Perry in meetings with Chinese officials.
Mr. Perry explained the administration's position on energy as an effort to balance economic growth with cleaning up the environment. He expressed support for fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas -- both of which are abundant in the U.S. and could be sold to China in greater quantities.
The Trump administration says the U.S. has done more to reduce emissions than other top emitters, including China, outside agreements under the Paris accord. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on the China-California talks. During the Obama administration, China and the U.S. looked to broad agreement on climate change as a chance to showcase joint purpose in an often fraught relationship.
China and other major emitters said they would follow through on their commitments despite Mr. Trump's decision.
How aggressively Beijing moves to cut emission levels after they peak by about 2030 -- as China has pledged to do -- may depend on whether the U.S. is also on board. Reaching the global goal of limiting the increase in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels would require significant cuts by China.
The dueling messages from Messrs. Perry and Brown contrasted with the united front Chinese officials present on major policy moves.
Zhou Dadi, vice president of the Beijing-backed Energy Research Institute, said China recognizes that the U.S. system allows states and cities to shape their own positions on the Paris commitments.
"In the United States, local governments can play a more important role," Mr. Zhou said, drawing a distinction with China's more centralized decision-making.

Full text:   BEIJING -- The top-ranking U.S. diplomat in Beijing resigned over President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, depleting already thinned-out State Department ranks and depriving Washington of one of its most experienced China hands.
David Rank, a 27-year veteran of the State Department, has been running the embassy in Beijing as charge d'affaires since January. He had been expected to continue in that role until Mr. Trump's pick for ambassador, former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, arrives.
Mr. Rank, who couldn't be reached to comment, announced his resignation at a town hall for embassy staff on Monday. He said his conscience prevented him from carrying out his duties after Mr. Trump's decision on the climate-change agreement, people who were at the meeting said.
U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry arrived in Beijing this week to attend an international gathering on clean energy and meet with Chinese officials. It would have been Mr. Rank's job to accompany Mr. Perry to those meetings and help explain the Trump administration's decision to exit from the Paris agreement.
U.S. divisions over energy policy played out against the backdrop of Mr. Perry's visit as another visitor, California Gov. Jerry Brown, was received at the Great Hall of the People by President Xi Jinping. The Chinese Foreign Ministry described Mr. Xi as telling Mr. Brown he valued local-level cooperation with the U.S. "It was very clear that he welcomes an increased role on the part of California" to fight climate change, Mr. Brown told reporters.
Mr. Perry wasn't expected to meet with Mr. Xi this week.
Mr. Rank's resignation comes as the Trump administration relies less on experienced career diplomats in its dealings with Asia. A diminished role for the State Department and its embassies has left foreign policy for the region in the hands of a few of the president's advisers, including Jared Kushner, his son-in-law.
Career foreign-service officers at the embassy in Beijing said they were largely kept out of the loop when U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited China in March.
Permanent candidates for scores of senior positions at the State Department, including that of assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, remain vacant.
"Dave Rank is the best America has to offer," said Scott Mulhauser, a former embassy chief of staff in Beijing. "There is a reason he's received ever-tougher postings from presidents and secretaries on all sides of the political spectrum."
Mr. Rank has been succeeded by economic counselor Jonathan Fritz, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy said.
Mr. Rank's departure was reported on Twitter by John Pomfret, a former Washington Post reporter who works for China news startup SupChina. Mr. Fritz couldn't be reached for comment.

Leaving Paris: Good Move or Terrible Error?

Abstract: In your editorial "Paris Climate Discord" (June 1) you imply that Germany is an example of a failed climate-change abatement program because its emission rate increased in the last two years while its electricity cost has risen greatly. Mounting pressure from generals because of the military threat of climate destabilization; frightening statistical analysis from re-insurers telling us that certain ZIP codes will be uninsurable; demands from shareholders that oil companies divulge the risks of climate change to the future viability of assets -- these are the unavoidable details that need to be hashed out like custody and compensation in a nasty divorce.

Full text:   Your editorial "Trump Bids Paris Adieu" (June 2) references our research to draw what we consider to be the exact wrong conclusion about the importance of the Paris agreement to addressing climate change. With full implementation of the nationally determined contributions that countries submitted in Paris, it is true that the world likely would still experience an unacceptable rise in global average temperature by 2100; but Paris is nevertheless a vital early step in a longer journey.
Full implementation of the agreement likely would reduce the temperature increase substantially, on the order of one degree Celsius compared with business as usual, according to several analyses. This may not sound like a lot, but consider that temperatures have risen about one degree since the preindustrial age, and in that time we've seen retreats of mountain glaciers and accelerated sea-level rise. The 10 warmest years since 1880 all occurred in the last 19 years.
More importantly, the Paris agreement provides a mechanism for countries to regularly revisit their contributions and ratchet up their ambitions over time. That the Paris agreement does not do enough today to address climate change is a reason to stick with it and strengthen it -- not abandon it. Paris provides an unprecedented framework for global cooperation on this serious threat. In our view, U.S. withdrawal from it is a grave mistake.

Affluent countries are wealthy enough to afford air conditioners as the planet warms. The "get rich enough to not care" view ignores that the environmental cost is borne by the poorest populations. Pulling out of the Paris agreement increases the environmental cost on those countries while hogging the supposed economic benefit. America First policies are flagrantly immoral in this context.

In your editorial "Paris Climate Discord" (June 1) you imply that Germany is an example of a failed climate-change abatement program because its emission rate increased in the last two years while its electricity cost has risen greatly. Yes, Germany's emissions were about 0.7% higher in 2016 than in 2014, but that's in the context of its dramatic 27.0% net-emission decrease between 1990 and 2016.

We're on track to meet the Paris climate deal target of a 26% drop in U.S. emissions between 2005 and 2025. U.S. emissions have already dropped 14.5% since 2005 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Most of the reduction in emissions is due to the increased use of natural gas. The private sector's development of fracking technology made this possible. Our emissions will continue to drop as technology and natural market forces seek to reduce input costs. The Paris climate deal is redundant.

Watching whether President Trump exits the Paris accord is like watching your parents decide whether they plan on separating: It matters, but it doesn't really change anything ("Trump Quits Global Climate Accord," page one, June 2). They are still your parents, and they still need to raise you. The decarbonization of the human economy is coming one way or the other. Mounting pressure from generals because of the military threat of climate destabilization; frightening statistical analysis from re-insurers telling us that certain ZIP codes will be uninsurable; demands from shareholders that oil companies divulge the risks of climate change to the future viability of assets -- these are the unavoidable details that need to be hashed out like custody and compensation in a nasty divorce.

The environmental denier is ceding America's leadership in the world. No more will other countries follow our lead, or even agree to cooperate with us, having seen that at any time our president can pull out, rescind and cancel our agreed-upon responsibilities. We are losing the competition to lead the next technological revolution, that of sustainable energy production. China now leads in solar, Denmark in wind and the Netherlands in tides. America leads in turning backward and inward. As our planet's temperature increases, we will suffer more destruction from hurricanes, floods, drought and fires. Instead of creating productive jobs by committing to sustainable energy, we will require jobs to clean up debris, fight fires, build seawalls and bury victims.

Full text:   President Donald Trump's aides on Sunday defended his decision to quit the Paris climate accord, but offered differing views on the president's beliefs about the environment.
Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, differed over whether the president believes climate change is man-made.
Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that climate change is "a hoax" and suggested it was "created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive."
Mr. Pruitt suggested in a series of television interviews Sunday that what the president believes specifically about climate change is irrelevant to his policy decision on the Paris accord.
"I think the whole question is an effort to get it off the point and the issue of whether Paris is good for this country or not," Mr. Pruitt said on ABC. "The president has indicated the climate changes."
Asked by ABC host George Stephanopoulos whether Mr. Trump still believes climate change is a hoax, Mr. Pruitt said he hadn't discussed it with the president.
"Our discussion, George, has been about the agreement, the efficacy of the agreement," Mr. Pruitt said. "That's what he spent the last several weeks focused upon, the merits and demerits of the Paris agreement. He put America first.He said that he's going to put jobs, and the environment first."
Ms. Haley, in a separate interview on CBS, went a step further than Mr. Pruitt, saying Mr. Trump "believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of that equation."
When asked by CBS host John Dickerson if Mr. Trump believes human activity causes climate change, Ms. Haley said, "I mean, John, I just gave you the answer. I mean, that's what he believes. And so that's as clear as I know to give it."
Advocates for the Paris climate accord criticized Mr. Trump's decision during their own appearances on the Sunday interview shows.
Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who helped negotiate the Paris accord, said Mr. Trump isn't familiar with the science underlying the agreement.
"The fact is that still his whole staff cannot tell you whether or not he believes that climate change is a hoax," Mr. Kerry said on NBC.
"If you truly understand the science, if you have done your due diligence and homework, there is no way that you cannot conclude that there's an urgency to doing something. And you would not pull out of Paris," Mr. Kerry said.
Former Vice President Al Gore, who met with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower and said he has since spoken with him about the environment by telephone, called Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement "reckless."
"It was indefensible," Mr. Gore said. "It undermines America's standing in the world."

Full text:   China and the European Union abandoned a plan to jointly declare their commitment to the Paris climate accord one day after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the global pact.
The plan to issue a joint declaration from a Brussels summit on Friday was derailed by EU-China trade disputes -- a reminder of the challenges of embracing China's efforts to carry the torch for globalist policies opposed by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump's rejection of the Paris accord gave China and the EU new common ground as each has faced fresh tensions with the U.S. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said at the summit that his country's partnership with the EU "is useful to counter the uncertainties in the world."
Following months of doubt about whether Mr. Trump would sustain President Barack Obama's commitment to the Paris accord, EU and Chinese officials had drafted the statement proclaiming their "highest political commitment" to the Paris accord and vowing cooperation.
China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, has said it would uphold its end of the Paris deal with or without a U.S. commitment. China is investing in clean-energy technologies -- even as it maintains state investment in polluting heavy industry.
The Brussels summit had been planned to focus on trade and foreign-policy issues but was overshadowed by Mr. Trump's decision on Thursday, which drew criticism from many nations committed to the Paris accord. European Council President Donald Tusk said both sides agreed the U.S. decision was "a big mistake."
Mr. Trump has given China other openings to exert greater global influence. In January, he withdrew the U.S. from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership that sought to deepen trade ties between the U.S. and China's neighbors, but excluded China itself. That left China in a position to depict itself as a free-trade champion and rally support for its own regional trade accord.
Chinese President Xi Jinping in January delivered a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he essentially laid claim to China's role as world leader on free trade.
However, in climate talks, a divide has persisted for years between developed nations and developing nations. The U.S. and Europe pushed the biggest developing nations, led by China and India, to accept some form of restraint on their emissions. Those nations have pushed back by arguing that much of the burden must be shouldered by wealthy nations, which over time have produced the bulk of emissions.
The Paris accord produced an uneasy truce between the two camps: Developing nations would work to limit their emissions, while wealthy nations would mobilize financing to help developing nations shift to renewable energy and build infrastructure to protect themselves from the effects of climate change.
Negotiations, however, are continuing over how to implement the accord.
Financial support by developed nations to poorer countries of up to $100 billion annually by 2020 was a major element of the Paris accord, and it remains unclear how the pact's champions will fill the gap after a U.S. withdrawal.
Major supporters of the climate deal like the EU and China are reviewing the issue, European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Canete said Friday after meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Brussels.
"It is possible that this creates the push to get better financing on climate change," an EU official said of Mr. Trump's decision. "Discussions started in Marrakesh in November, when Mr. Trump was elected and it became clear that he was not going to pursue the climate agreement."
"This fight around the division between developing and developed countries hasn't been put to rest," said a European diplomat involved in the talks.
In one dispute, wealthy nations are seeking strong transparency rules, to ensure China and other developing nations report emissions properly.
"It would definitely have been better with the U.S. at the table," the European diplomat said, "because the Chinese and other developing countries are not at the same place about what type of transparency regime should be in place."
While Friday's trade differences were unrelated to climate issues, they highlight the tensions China has sparked in another sphere by deploying what Europe and the U.S. have called unfair trade practices.
The European Commission president on Friday warned Mr. Li that failure to tackle these issues could fuel populist movements in the region that oppose globalization and free trade. China has said it is the EU and U.S. that are breaching World Trade Organization rules by slapping large duties on some Chinese steel exports.

Full text:   New York's attorney general alleged Friday that Exxon Mobil Corp. may have misled investors about how it accounts for the impact of climate-change regulations on its operations by using internal estimates that differed from its public statements.
Disclosing for the first time some of the specific evidence his office has collected in its long-running probe of the oil giant, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman claimed that he found documents and other information showing that Exxon's process for estimating future costs of greenhouse-gas regulations on its business "may be a sham."
He made the claims in a filing in New York state court seeking to compel Exxon to release additional documents and produce witnesses for the probe, which began in 2015. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also examining Exxon's accounting practices and climate-change disclosures.
An Exxon spokesman called the allegations "inaccurate and irresponsible" and said the company would respond in future court filings. Exxon's "external statements have accurately described its use of a proxy cost of carbon, and the documents produced to the attorney general make this fact unmistakably clear," spokesman Scott Silvestri said.
The company has said its accounting practices are legal. In the past year, Exxon also has repeatedly voiced its support for the Paris climate accord and backed a carbon tax.
At the center of the claims the New York state prosecutor made Friday is one of Exxon's central assurances to investors on climate-change risk: that since 2007, the company has included a "proxy cost of carbon" in its assessment of the viability of its oil and gas projects. That is an estimate of how much governments around the world might charge Exxon or other companies for the carbon dioxide they emit, through a carbon tax or other emissions fees.
Such assessments can have a material impact on how an energy company values its assets. With a higher estimated cost of carbon, certain projects could become unprofitable, potentially requiring an accounting write-down or recognition of losses on a company's books. But Mr. Schneiderman alleges that from 2010 to 2014, documents indicate the company used "secret, internal figures" that understated potential future costs from climate regulations, even while suggesting publicly that it used higher estimates.
The company said in a 2014 report that it applied a cost of $60 per ton of greenhouse-gas emissions in 2030 to its projects in developed countries. The state prosecutor filed documents Friday that appeared to show it actually used a price of $40 a ton internally. In 2010, an Exxon employee identified as a corporate greenhouse-gas manager said in an email that the $60 a ton figure used for Exxon's annual Energy Outlook was "more realistic," according to documents released with the filing.

Trump's Climate Shift: States Stick With Climate Pact Goals

Author: Lazo, Alejandro

Full text:   SAN FRANCISCO -- A day after President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, states and cities around the country said they would adhere to their own aggressive climate policies.
Twenty states and Washington, D.C., have adopted their own greenhouse gas emission targets, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, and some press beyond the U.S. commitment under the accord, which sought to reduce greenhouse emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.
California Gov. Jerry Brown is encouraging states to pursue their own climate standards, as well as developing his own international climate agenda and pushing tougher standards than the federal government had under the Obama administration.
Following the Thursday announcement, Mr. Brown, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee said they would form a new coalition of states committed to upholding the American side of the Paris treaty deal.
The governors called the coalition the United States Climate Alliance, which they said will "act as a forum to sustain and strengthen existing climate programs, promote the sharing of information and best practices, and implement new programs to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors of the economy."
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the United Nations secretary-general's special envoy for cities and climate change, said through an adviser on Friday that those three states, along with a coalition of at least 100 businesses and 30 cities would on Monday submit a letter of intent to the U.N. indicating the coalition would meet the U.S. goals through their own commitments.
Not all states were upset with Mr. Trump's decision.
In West Virginia, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the withdrawal would benefit the state's ailing coal industry. "West Virginians have suffered tremendous economic calamity as a result of the Obama administration's anti-coal agenda . . . ," the Republican senator said in a statement. "President Trump is standing with our West Virginia workers and businesses to keep jobs in our state."
The president said he left the agreement with the hope of boosting American industry and independence and called his decision a "reassertion of our sovereignty."
Twenty-nine states have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to sell a certain amount, or percentage, of renewable electricity, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"States have been doing this for a long time and long before there has been consideration at the federal level," said Glen Andersen, energy program director at the NCSL.
Other states are ramping up their renewable-energy generation because prices are competitive and such projects add jobs, said Rachel Cleetus, the lead economist and climate policy manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.
Texas, for instance, has become a leader in renewable-energy production, even without a legislative mandate. The state, which has a quarter of all the wind power in America, is getting 12.6% of its electricity from wind, according to the American Wind Energy Association.

Full text:   The Trump administration's withdrawal from the Paris agreement heralds a decisive change in U.S. climate policy, but many corporate leaders say it will have little immediate impact on their investments and strategies.
President Donald Trump said the U.S. will begin negotiations to either re-enter the accord or start a new deal on "terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers."
Some mining companies, including Murray Energy Corp., the country's largest privately held coal miner, hailed the decision, saying the climate rules would have threatened jobs and economic growth.
But a number of major corporations and chief executives expressed disappointment in the move, including Dow Chemical Co. and Microsoft Corp. as well as the heads of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.
"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in his first tweet ever.
Many large companies said they wouldn't change course, and their reasons are diverse. Companies are responding to customer and shareholder demands to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Many operate in states and countries that are putting in place climate rules and thus face pressures beyond the U.S. government.
Firms are buying natural gas and renewable electricity that emit less pollutants because they are becoming cheaper. And many are making long-term capital investments to reduce their carbon footprints with an eye toward future decades, not the current election cycle.
Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S. oil producer, has said it wants a consistent set of rules, and favors remaining in the Paris Agreement. "We need a framework like that to address the challenge of climate change and the risk of climate change," Chief Executive Darren Woods said at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday, where 62% of shareholders voted for a resolution to pressure Exxon to share more information about how climate change could affect its business.
General Electric Co. has spent billions to make technologies that reduce energy consumption a core part of its business. "Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement," GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said via Twitter. "Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government."
Ford Motor Co. said it was still committed to technology investments to make its vehicles emit less carbon dioxide, including shorter-term moves to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine, and longer-term plans to develop affordable fuel cells and enhanced batteries to create electric vehicles that can travel longer. Much of the auto industry is on a similar course.
Some companies support leaving the agreement because they see it as a way to jump-start industries weighed down by environmental regulations. Murray Energy's controlling owner, Robert Murray, has been a strong backer of Mr. Trump. "In following through on his promise, President Trump is supporting America's uncompromising values, saving coal jobs, and promoting low-cost, reliable electricity for Americans and the rest of the world," he said.
Peabody Energy Corp., a coal producer in St. Louis, supported the decision. "We believe that abiding by the accord, without significant changes, would have substantially impacted the U.S. economy, increased electricity costs and required the power sector to rely on less diverse and more intermittent energy."
Adam Green, an analyst for World Steel Dynamics, a steel-industry consulting firm, said Mr. Trump's decision won't immediately affect the industry, but "it lifts some of the veiled uncertainty" about the cost of complying with future regulations.
U.S. energy-related carbon emissions are at their lowest level since 1992, according to federal statistics. This is mostly because the U.S. electricity system has replaced a large amount of coal-fired power with natural gas and renewables.
American Electric Power Co., one of the largest utility companies in the U.S., has been shifting toward more gas, wind and solar because the moves are popular with customers and provide increasingly inexpensive power, said Chief Executive Nick Akins. He said it was a mistake for the U.S. to exit from the agreement.

Full text:   PARIS -- World leaders vowed to stick with the 2015 Paris accord without the U.S., amid concerns about the deal's long-term political support and the need to replace billions of dollars that Washington had pledged in climate-change finance.
A chorus of leaders Thursday criticized President Donald Trump's decision. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni spoke by phone after Mr. Trump's speech. The three leaders issued a statement saying the Paris accord is "irreversible."
In a statement, Japan's government called the U.S. move "regrettable," but its environment minister was more candid at a news conference. "It's as if they've turned their backs on the wisdom of humanity," Koichi Yamamoto told reporters.
Vows from Beijing, Paris and other capitals to defend the international agreement might keep it on track in the short term. But officials and analysts say the deal's long-term future is in danger.
"You can't pick up the slack of the world's second-largest emitter," said Paul Bodnar, who led the climate finance negotiations for the U.S. in Paris.
The U.S.'s willingness under the Obama administration to propose major emissions reductions and put money on the table helped solidify global consensus behind the deal. It also helped persuade politicians world-wide of the need to seek more ambitious cuts and channel more money into the fight against global warming, officials and experts say.
The U.S. joins war-torn Syria and Nicaragua as the only nations not participating in the deal.
A pillar of the deal called for wealthy nations to provide at least $100 billion a year in financing to developing countries. The goal was to shift the entire course of economic development in poorer nations, directing them to renewable energy before they become dependent on fossil fuels.
Governments acknowledged that rich nations need to mobilize significantly more than $100 billion each year to ensure that emissions in poor nations don't soar as their economies grow.

Full text:   President Donald Trump said Thursday he will withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord in an effort to boost the nation's industry and independence, making a dramatic shift in policy despite intense lobbying from business leaders and close allies.
"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris," Mr. Trump said, calling the decision a "reassertion of our sovereignty."
Mr. Trump said he would begin negotiations to either re-enter the Paris agreement under new terms or craft a new deal that he judges fair to the U.S. and its workers.
Several countries immediately rejected that idea. During a phone call Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron of France told Mr. Trump that the Paris agreement can't be changed, and he issued a joint statement with the leaders of Germany and Italy that the accord "cannot be renegotiated."
Mr. Trump, framing his decision mostly in economic and political terms, pointed to the agreement's lesser requirements for the world's other leading carbon emitters, China and India. He voiced his concern for protecting the environment and eschewed any reiteration of his past claims that climate change isn't real, but he said his decision is rooted in protecting the country's interests.
"This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage" over the U.S., the GOP president said.
Mr. Trump's action represents a 180-degree turn from the environmental agenda of his Democratic predecessor, former President Barack Obama, whose administration helped orchestrate the agreement, which pledged the U.S. to reduce carbon emissions. Mr. Trump's decision was cheered by some domestic industries, notably coal and oil-and-gas companies, including Murray Energy Corp., the country's largest privately held coal miner.
But some large U.S. corporations opposed the move, including Exxon Mobil Corp., General Electric Co. and Apple Inc., whose chief executives all publicly argued in favor of remaining in the pact. After Mr. Trump's announcement, Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co. CEO Robert Iger said they would withdraw from the president's advisory councils.
Some big companies said exiting the deal would have little immediate impact on their investments and strategies because they are facing customer and shareholder demands to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. They also operate in other countries, and in U.S. states, where climate rules remain a fact of life, so they continue to face government pressure.
The decision on the climate deal came after months of tense debates within a divided West Wing and intense speculation in the 48 hours leading up to the announcement.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson pressed the president to keep the U.S. in the Paris accord, as did Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and leaders at the Pentagon, who have long viewed combating climate change as a matter of national security.
Senior adviser Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt led the internal push to persuade Mr. Trump to follow through on his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris accord. Following the president's speech, Mr. Pruitt closed out the ceremony by praising Mr. Trump for his "unflinching commitment to put America first," and he characterized the withdrawal as a "historic restoration of American economic independence."
Lawmakers' reactions split largely along party lines, with many Republicans saying Mr. Trump's decision would unshackle domestic industry and create jobs.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Mr. Trump's decision dealt "another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs."
But many Democrats criticized the Paris exit, saying Mr. Trump was relinquishing leadership on an important issue.
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, said the decision to withdraw was a "devastating failure of historic proportions."
Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that despite Mr. Trump saying he represented the people of his city, most voters there supported Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. "I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future," he wrote.
Although the final decision remained in doubt right up until the president's emphatic statement Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump had drafted the resolution to withdraw from the Paris agreement two weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the internal deliberations that pitted Messrs. Bannon and Pruitt against much of Mr. Trump's economic and national-security advisers, as well as his own family.
But the president was resolute, telling his team that there were too many costs and that the U.S. would no longer be laughed at for participating in such deals, a person familiar with the matter said.
He said he wanted to deliver a campaign promise to "my people," meaning his base of voters, this person said. "He looked at this like it was a union deal -- slap them in the face, and then renegotiate," the person said.
Mr. Obama issued a statement Thursday standing by the Paris accord and the U.S. role in forging it.
Renegotiating the agreement or entering under new terms could be very difficult in practice, since nearly all nations agreed on the deal in 2015, and leading economies have said they would continue with the original deal if the U.S. leaves.
Other countries -- led by European nations -- place a much higher importance on cooperation to curb climate change, so Mr. Trump's move could reduce his flexibility in working with world leaders, especially if the withdrawal from the Paris agreement affects public attitude toward the U.S.
"It will undercut the trust that other countries have in the U.S. in entering into agreements -- trade agreements, agreements on security issues, you name it," said David Waskow, director of the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank.
Backing away from climate commitments could also shift some investments in potentially lucrative green-energy technology away from the U.S. and toward economic rivals, including China, which pledged massive investment in renewable energy through the pact.
"It is going to lead to major corporations and nations partnering with China," said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate official in the Clinton administration and lecturer at American University in Washington.
A Trump administration official said Thursday the president is sincere in supporting a possible renegotiation of the deal or a process for the U.S. to re-enter under different terms, which could include less ambitious emissions targets, but offered little additional clarity on what concessions might satisfy the administration and how it planned to engage the nearly 200 countries involved in a renegotiation.
The Paris accord allowed participating countries to determine their own set of emissions targets and plans to reach them with the broader goal of keeping average global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels. That level is considered by climate scientists to be the danger threshold, beyond which damage to the planet would become irreversible.
The U.S. had pledged to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. The U.S. is the world's second-largest emitter of carbon, behind China, which has reaffirmed its own commitment to meeting its targets under the Paris accord.

Full text:   President Donald Trump's decision to exit from the Paris climate accord is only the beginning of a multiyear process for extricating the U.S. from the deal, which was signed by most nations around the world. Here is how a withdrawal is likely to unfold, if Mr. Trump follows through on his plan:
According to the Paris pact, countries can only exit three years after the effective date of the deal. That was Nov. 4, 2016, 30 days after a sufficient number of countries ratified the deal reached in December 2015.
The Paris accord was reached as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, which took effect in 1994 and includes 197 countries, including the U.S. The convention was ratified by the Senate in 1992. If Mr. Trump had taken the "nuclear option" and withdrawn from the UNFCCC, he could have left the pact in a year.
Starting in November 2019, Mr. Trump could send a written request to exit from the accord. Backers of the deal built in a delay to allow a global shift in climate politics to dissuade governments from exiting. The U.S. president could also change his mind by late 2019, just as the 2020 presidential campaign heats up.
After the UNFCCC receives Mr. Trump's request, the U.S. would be out of the Paris agreement after one year, or as early as November 2020.
The real result of Mr. Trump's move would only be apparent in 2025, when the targets of the Paris agreement become effective. The nonbinding U.S. target was to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 26% to 28% below their 2005 levels.
Environmental groups say the Paris agreement was designed to be durable, and a future U.S. administration could get Washington back into the pact, assuming the U.S. stays in the underlying UNFCCC.

U.S. News: Trump Likely to End Climate Deal --- President weighs outright withdrawal or fewer emissions cuts; lobbying intensifies

Abstract: Mr. Trump has also heard from business leaders and senior aides who are urging him not to completely withdraw. Because the Paris agreement is nonbinding, Mr. Trump has the option of lowering the emissions targets for the U.S. without withdrawing completely, which could take three years under the original agreement.

Full text:   President Donald Trump said he would make an announcement Thursday on the Paris climate treaty, with three White House officials saying he is expected to withdraw from the accord, although they cautioned that the situation may yet change.
The president said on Twitter late Wednesday that he will announce his decision Thursday afternoon at the White House Rose Garden.
Under the accord, 190 countries committed to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions, in an effort to combat climate change. The agreement aims to keep average global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels.
Under the agreement, each country determines its own set of emissions targets and a plan to reach them.
The U.S. had pledged to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. The U.S. is the world's second-largest emitter of carbon, behind China, which has reaffirmed its own commitment to meeting its targets under the Paris accord.
According to several administration officials, Mr. Trump had been weighing how far to go in fulfilling a campaign promise that he would pull the U.S. from the accord.
Mr. Trump has also heard from business leaders and senior aides who are urging him not to completely withdraw.
Because the Paris agreement is nonbinding, Mr. Trump has the option of lowering the emissions targets for the U.S. without withdrawing completely, which could take three years under the original agreement.
The president met Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has advocated remaining in the deal. A day earlier, Mr. Trump met with a leading voice for complete withdrawal, Environmental Protection AgencyAdministrator Scott Pruitt.
Messrs. Pruitt and Trump have both expressed skepticism about the role of human activity as a leading factor in climate change.
Dozens of Fortune 500 companies have lobbied the administration to remain in the agreement, expressing their collective support in a public advertising campaign and privately in smaller meetings and phone calls with the president.
Large companies say the accord provides a predictable and practical framework for reducing emissions and can serve to boost competitiveness and job creation while minimizing business risks from climate change. One of Mr. Trump's closest business allies, Dow Chemical Co. Chief Executive Andrew Liveris, has been seeking an Oval Office meeting this week to make his case, a person familiar with the matter said.
Following reports Wednesday morning that a withdrawal might be imminent, Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook and Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk were among the business leaders placing calls to the White House in a last-minute effort to persuade the president to reconsider, say people familiar with the calls.
At last week's summit of the Group of Seven leading nations in Sicily, European leaders also focused their conversations with Mr. Trump on convincing him of the importance of U.S. leadership when it comes to combating climate change.

Leaders Defend
Global Agreement
World powers are locking arms to defend the 2015 Paris climate accord should President Donald Trump decide to pull the U.S. from the deal.
From Brussels to Beijing, leaders say they are ready to move ahead without Mr. Trump and implement the agreement. In some cases, nations have agreed to accelerate their adoption of the Paris deal.
The European Union and China are due Friday to sign a statement at a summit in Brussels that calls for "stepping up action" in the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, according to a draft of the document viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
"The EU and China underline their highest political commitment to the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement," the draft states. "They call on all parties to uphold the Paris Agreement."
The push to rally international support for the Paris deal reflects determination to prevent a decadelong diplomatic effort from unraveling without the involvement of the world's leading economy.It is also a sign of flexibility built into the deal that was needed to win backing from more than 190 nations: The agreement prescribes no target for emissions reductions, only that governments prepare plans to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
A U.S. withdrawal, however, risks fostering long-term ill will among America's negotiating partners, particularly in the developed world.

Full text:   DALLAS -- Exxon Mobil Corp. shareholders delivered a significant rebuke to the oil giant Wednesday, calling for the company to share more information about how climate change and regulations could affect its operations.
The climate proposal won the support of 62% of shareholders who cast ballots at Exxon's annual meeting, evidence that investors see climate change as a major risk that warrants greater transparency from oil-and-gas companies.
Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc., Exxon's two largest shareholders, supported the measure, people familiar with the votes said. The proposal pushes Exxon to conduct a climate "stress test" to measure how regulations to reduce greenhouse gases and new energy technologies could impact the value of its oil assets.
The Exxon vote came amid reports that President Donald Trump was leaning toward pulling out of the 2015 Paris accord to restrict carbon emissions and counter rising temperature. The president said on Twitter Wednesday morning that he would make his determination "over the next few days."
Exxon has stepped up its climate disclosures in recent years, stated its commitment to the Paris climate pact, named an environmental expert to its board and worked to cut emissions in its operations.
The company, which recommended shareholders vote against the proposal, met with about 25% of its shareholders prior to the meeting to discuss their concerns, which included climate vulnerabilities.
"We're confident in the commercial viability of our portfolio," Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Darren Woods said Wednesday. Mr. Woods said the company would "step back and reflect on the vote" and how it could better express its position.
"This is a turning point," said Anne Simpson, the investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, which supported the proposal. She said the vote "demonstrates that investors are seeking strong reporting and scenario analysis to better understand the risks and opportunities of climate change."
In 2014, Exxon produced a climate-related report saying that none of its assets were at risk of being stranded or left untapped due to climate change. The company has consistently said that energy demand will rise through 2040 as people around the world, particularly in emerging nations, join the middle class.
At the annual meeting, an estimated 68% of investors voted for the company's pay practices, a decline from about 90% in previous years. Proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services said the company's goals aren't specific enough and grants to executives lack performance criteria.
Both votes on Wednesday are nonbinding, and the tallies are preliminary.

Full text:   Regarding Cliff Forrest's "The 'Business Case' for Paris Is Bunk" (op-ed, May 30): I contributed to global warming by printing the Paris Agreement on climate change. It's only 25 pages of text but stuffed with loopholes big enough to drive a gas-guzzler through. It was obviously written by diplomats, not scientists. It's stunningly vague. It has only two specific goals: to "hold the increase in the average temperature to below 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels" and "achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century." Who picked these goals? Are they sufficient to save the planet and humanity? Are they technically possible? And why do this in the second half of the century? The way it reads, if we succeed by 2099, we win. Spoiler alert: We're all toast before then.
The agreement has no teeth. No goals for individual countries, no due dates in this century, no penalties. Lots of fuzzy empty words like aim, equity, context, enhancing, encouraged, strive, robust, promote, incentivize, facilitate, enable, sharing, strengthening, assisting and mobilizing. I guess we all should hold hands and sing "Kumbaya."
It's certain to have many countries pointing fingers at each other and squabbling about "fair share" and other baloney while the planet cooks.
The signers could make it tougher, set goals for each signer and say something about the science. But given the enormous costs of combating climate change and our world-wide addictions to oil and coal, it's unlikely that many of them will make big sacrifices. I wish our species were wiser.

The "American case" should be a fully underwritten evaluation of the pros and cons of the Paris agreement for the U.S. If Arthur Cecil Pigou were alive today, he would likely argue that climate change is the perfect and ultimate negative externality. Who is benefiting from the activity and who will be hurt by it? If science has it right, the costs to Florida, New Jersey, Southern California and other coastal states over the next 50-75 years will likely be in the trillions of dollars.
Like Mr. Forrest, I'm a stakeholder in the U.S. energy economy. While it may be true that near-term financial statements would support the notion of a bad business case for Paris, all of us need to be focused on the American case in the long run.

U.S. News: Trump Confronts Some New Challenges --- As his lawyer is drawn into Russia probe and a staffer exits, climate accord decision looms

Author: Bender, Michael C; Stokols, Eli

http://abc.cardiff.ac.uk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/u-s-news-trump-confronts-some-new-challenges-as/docview/1903759762/se-2?accountid=9883

Abstract: Legislative successes or an announcement on the Paris accord could provide Mr. Trump with some relief from daily headlines dominated by the expanding investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller and Congress into Russia's alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign and any links Moscow had to Trump aides.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump, returning from his first overseas trip, on Tuesday faced a new set of realities in Washington that have beset his White House.
He learned his personal attorney is now being drawn into the congressional probes of his team's ties to Russia, he announced the resignation of his communications chief and he interviewed new candidatesfor FBI director -- three weeks after he abruptlyfired the last one.
As Mr. Trump seeks to stabilizehis White House, he used a series of morning Twitter posts to call attention to policy issues. In one, he urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to hasten passage of health-care and tax legislation. And in the White House, he continued his deliberations about whether the U.S. should exit from a multination climate accord forged in Paris.
Legislative successes or an announcement on the Paris accord could provide Mr. Trump with some relief from daily headlines dominated by the expanding investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller and Congress into Russia's alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign and any links Moscow had to Trump aides.
That examination has now moved into the president's inner circle, as meetings between Russian officials and Mr. Trump's son-in-law and chief adviser, Jared Kushner, are under review.
Mr. Kushner's attorney has said that his client will cooperate with any probe and that he hasn't been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. During the transition period, Mr. Kushner met with the head of a state-run Russian bank that has faced U.S. sanctions. He also met with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Mr. Kushner also considered creating a direct line to talk to the Russians, according to a person familiar with his actions.
Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Flynn, also agreed Tuesday to turn over documents from his businesses to the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to a person familiar with his decision. Mr. Flynn was forced to resign early in the administration after lying to top White House officials about his conversations with Mr. Kislyak.
Congressional investigators on Tuesday also asked Mr. Trump's longtime attorney, Michael Cohen, to hand over documents and participate in a sit-down interview. The request signaled that the investigation on Capitol Hill is widening to include people in the inner circle of the president's business empire.
Mr. Cohen said in an interview that he would "respectfully decline" the requests from both the House and Senate intelligence panels.
Mr. Cohen, anattorney and executive in the Trump Organization, has been at the center of Mr. Trump's legal dealings, including involvement in negotiations for a Trump real-estate venture in Moscow that didn't materialize.
Earlier this year, a little-known Ukrainian lawmaker, Andriy Artemenko, said he tried to get his peace plan for Ukraine to the White House through Mr. Cohen and one of his relatives. Although Mr. Artemenko said he received confirmation that the plan reached the White House, Mr. Cohen said in an interview it wasn't delivered.
The probes on Capitol Hill are running parallel to the FBI investigation. The committees aim to write definitive reports about Russian interference in the election, while Mr. Mueller's investigation is focused on counterintelligence concerns and whether any laws were broken.
Mr. Trump has expressed his frustration with the coverage of the investigations, calling it "fake news." Russia has denied any interference.
For weeks, there have been rumors of a staff turnover. On Tuesday, Mike Dubke, the communications director, became the first to exit. He joined the administration about a month after the inauguration and has struggled to jell with the president, officials have said.
"The reasons for my departure are personal," Mr. Dubke wrote in an email to friends Tuesday.
A senior official said the White House is likely to fill the position internally.
The president also has discussed a lower-profile role for press secretary Sean Spicer, said people who have talked to Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump also met privately on Tuesday with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, one of the leading advocates for withdrawing the U.S. from the 190-nation Paris agreement aimed at slowing the pace of climate change.
"We all know nothing's settled until it's settled, and he usually goes with the last person who was in his ear," one person close to Mr. Pruitt said of Mr. Trump.
Several business leaders are attempting to set up meetings in an effort to sway Mr. Trump before he makes a decision.
Dow Chemical Co. Chief Executive Andrew Liveris, who Mr. Trump has tapped to lead a manufacturing council, is among those seeking an Oval Office meeting this week and hoping to persuade the president not to withdraw from the accord, said a person knowledgeable about the request.

Full text:   TAORMINA, Italy -- President Donald Trump has no plans to scale back sanctions on Russia, according to a top adviser, a stance that could soothe concerns that his administration would soften its stance toward Moscow.
Meanwhile, in talks with leaders of the Group of Seven countries, Mr. Trump left allies in the dark as to whether he will repudiate the 2015 Paris climate agreement, an issue that enjoys broad European support.
The developments came as discussions began in earnest on the first of the two-day G-7 summit. Tensions over trade, Russia and climate change hung over the start of the meetings, which offers leaders a major opportunity to confront the new U.S. administration on a range of divisive issues. The talks are scheduled to culminate in a final communique on Saturday.
"No doubt this will be the most challenging G-7 summit in years," European Council President Donald Tusk said at a news conference before the meeting.
According to Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump's top economic adviser who is traveling with the president, Mr. Trump has no intention of "lowering our sanctions on Russia."
"If anything we would probably look to get tougher on Russia," Mr. Cohn said. "The president wants to continue to keep the sanctions in place."
European leaders, however, remain unsettled by Mr. Trump's remarks earlier in the week, when during a visit to Brussels he criticized the Europeans for owing "massive amounts of money" to the budget of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He also declined to endorse explicitly NATO's common defense provision, disappointing some European diplomats.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump offered the G-7 leaders no reassurance regarding his stance on one of their top priorities: persuading the U.S. not to withdraw from the Paris climate-change agreement.
The 2015 deal calls for governments across the world to develop plans to limit their emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists have said are causing the earth to warm. Before the start of the summit, Mr. Cohn suggested that the U.S. could propose changes to its committed emissions levels.
At a meeting at the Vatican on Wednesday, Pope Francis encouraged the GOP president to stick with the climate agreement.
But during Friday afternoon's discussions, Mr. Trump gave little away.
"The environment is very, very important to me, Donald Trump. I care a lot about the environment," said the president, according to Mr. Cohn.
But Mr. Trump also raised concerns about the U.S. falling behind China and India in manufacturing and said he ran on a policy of reversing that trend. He said he had to consider how environmental restrictions might adversely affect creating more U.S. jobs.
The other six leaders argued in favor of the Paris accord.
"The arguments on this were exchanged very intensively," said Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said afterward.
The leaders asked Mr. Trump when he planned to make a decision. "I want to get to the right decision. So I'd rather take my time," Mr. Trump told them, according to Mr. Cohn.
The meeting in Taormina also has been an opportunity for Mr. Trump to soothe tensions with the United Kingdom, the U.S.'s closest European ally, over intelligence-sharing after British officials accused his administration of leaking sensitive information about the investigation into the Manchester attack this week. British Prime Minister Theresa May said Friday that Mr. Trump reassured her that "leaks were unacceptable" and said the U.S. and the U.K. have resumed sharing information.
All of the leaders signed an agreement Friday to share intelligence more effectively and to press internet providers and social-media companies to tackle terrorist content. They also pledged to cut off terrorist financing and share more information about foreign fighters returning from territories controlled by Islamic State and al Qaeda.
Separately, Mr. Trump sparked a small incident with remarks denouncing Germany's large trade surplus with the U.S. during a meeting with European Union leaders in Brussels. Mr. Trump said that Germany is "very bad" on trade issues, Mr. Cohn said.
German newsweekly Der Spiegel set off the outcry when it reported that Mr. Trump told European leaders that "Germany is bad, very bad," because of its large trade surplus with the U.S.
The leaders are expected to discuss rules for preventing unfair trade, a highly divisive subject among the G-7 countries. Germany's large trade surplus with the U.S. has been a persistent source of anger for Mr. Trump.
Mr. Cohn attempted to smooth the situation over. "He said, 'I don't have a problem with Germany. I have a problem with German trade,' " Mr. Cohn said.
In response, Ms. Merkel noted the German trade surplus with the U.S. was an expression of the high quality of German goods and should be seen in the context of multicountry supply chains within the EU single market.
Elsewhere, Mr. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed during a meeting before the start of the summit to adopt tougher sanctions on North Korea, directing aides to identify entities that support Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear programs, according to a White House statement.

Full text:   Two of the world's largest asset managers are considering a public rebuke to Exxon Mobil Corp. over climate change at the company's annual meeting next week, according to people familiar with the matter.
BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group are weighing a vote in favor of an investor proposal that would seek to pressure the oil giant to conduct a climate "stress test" to measure how regulations to reduce greenhouse gases and new energy technologies could affect the value of its oil assets, the people said.
Exxon has urged investors to vote against the resolution.
If the proposal passes at Exxon's annual meeting Wednesday, experts say it would be the strongest signal to date that investors are seeking greater disclosure of the threats that climate change could pose to businesses.
Passage also would highlight the emerging power of money managers with large passive investing businesses -- and their willingness to wield it.
Five years ago, many investors weren't as attuned to how climate change could affect the value of assets, but "now the evidence just slaps you in the face," said Timothy Smith, a director at Walden Asset Management, which has pressured money managers on climate issues and is backing the Exxon measure.
BlackRock is still considering whether to support the proposal.
"No decision has been made regarding our vote at Exxon's Annual Shareholder Meeting. Our deliberations continue and we look forward to continued engagement with the company," Zach Oleksiuk, head of Americas for BlackRock's investment stewardship group, said in a statement.
Vanguard also is strongly considering a vote for the proposal, the people said.
The asset managers could side with the company if Exxon offers certain concessions, including making further disclosures or agreeing to allow its nonemployee directors to meet with investors, the people said.
Such concessions in the past have led BlackRock to side with companies and vote against proposals related to climate-change disclosure.

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- President Donald Trump held his first meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and senior European Union leaders on Thursday here, the capital of a bloc whose future he has questioned and whose opponents he has feted.
The Brussels meetings bring together champions of two competing world visions and leaders who have used each other as foils to build domestic support. After the meetings, it was clear many critical differences remained.
"There are subjects we don't have the same reading of, but we were able to speak in a very direct way," Mr. Macron said after he and Mr. Trump had lunch together.
Before their lunch, the French and U.S. leaders engaged in a long handshake, which saw Mr. Macron keep a grip on Mr. Trump's hand as the latter apparently tried to pull away. Later, it was Mr. Trump's turn to take control, pulling Mr. Macron in close to him when the two shook hands at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization gathering.
Mr. Trump was a vocal supporter of Britain's decision in June 2016 to leave the EU, seeing in it the kind of antiestablishment, nationalist revival he was tapping into for his own presidential bid.
Shortly before taking office, he said the EU was largely a "vehicle for Germany." While he stayed officially neutral in the recent French presidential election, he hailed Mr. Macron's rival, nationalist leader Marine Le Pen, as the strongest on borders and security.
Europe's leaders have responded in kind. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker threatened to campaign for the independence of Ohio if Mr. Trump continued supporting the EU's breakup. Mr. Macron challenged the U.S. president's stance on immigration, trade and climate change during his campaign.
Yet officials on both sides said they were looking to bolster trust. Failure to do so could have repercussions across many issues, including the Paris climate accord, the Iranian nuclear deal and the fight against terrorism.
After the meeting with Mr. Trump, EU officials said the two sides had agreed to tighten coordination on trade issues, including responding to unfair practices by third countries, such as China.
And at his meeting with Mr. Macron, Mr. Trump denied backing Ms. Le Pen during the French election campaign, according to a French official present. At one moment, the U.S. president told Mr. Macron "you were my guy," the French official said.
Yet there was little effort to mask continued differences. European Council President Donald Tusk said while there was agreement on many questions, "some issues remain open, like climate and trade.
"And I am not 100% sure that we can say today -- we, meaning Mr. President Trump and myself -- that we have a common position, a common opinion about Russia," he said.
Mr. Juncker described the meeting with Mr. Trump as cordial and constructive. But he also seemed a little wary of the U.S. leader. Asked about his impressions of Mr. Trump, Mr. Juncker said, "I hope he hasn't sent a tweet about me yet."
Mr. Trump's lunch with Mr. Macron was "extremely frank and direct," the French leader said, covering a broad range of subjects including Thursday afternoon's NATO summit and the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations.
Mr. Macron pledged during the presidential campaign to ramp up France's military spending to reach the NATO target of 2% of economic output by 2025, a demand Mr. Trump called a bare minimum later on Thursday.
The future of the Paris climate agreement was another issue on which they locked horns.
Mr. Trump has previously threatened to jettison U.S. adherence to the deal. At lunch with Mr. Macron, he said the U.S. and France have "differences but not disagreement," French officials said.

Full text:   VATICAN CITY -- President Donald Trump and Pope Francis met for a fence-mending encounter that balanced talk of stark disagreements on issues such as migration with accord on other topics, including abortion.
Seated across from each other in the pope's private study on Wednesday, Mr. Trump and the pontiff spoke for 30 minutes, aided by an interpreter. Before leaving the Vatican, the president told the pope, "Thank you, thank you. I won't forget what you said."
During his talks later with Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy, he said his meeting with the pope was "fantastic."
"He is something," the president said of the pontiff, who during last year's presidential campaign criticized Mr. Trump's views on immigration and said the candidate's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border made him "not Christian."
In a short communique following the visit, the Vatican highlighted points on which Mr. Trump and the pope agree, including abortion and religious liberty, as well as their notable differences, including health care and immigration.
One longstanding point of contention the communique didn't mention was the environment. After their conversation, however, the pope gave Mr. Trump a copy of his encyclical on the environment, in which he argues that capitalism has contributed to the degradation of the environment at the particular expense of the poor. The president thanked him, saying he would read it.
Mr. Trump's visit capped a tour through countries that are home to the holiest sites for three of the world's leading religions: Islam, Judaism and Christianity. His trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel and Vatican City is intended to try to unify religious leaders around an effort to combat extremism.
On international affairs, the communique highlighted an "exchange of views" -- diplomatic parlance that typically suggests disagreement -- over the "promotion of peace in the world through political negotiation and interreligious dialogue, with particular reference to the situation in the Middle East and the protection of Christian communities."
The Vatican also highlighted a "joint commitment in favor of life, and freedom of worship and conscience" between the Holy See and Mr. Trump's administration. Those were apparent references to abortion and to the demand by U.S. Catholic leaders for a religious exemption to the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump has promised to provide. They were a significant concession to the White House because the pope hasn't made such issues a priority.
But that point of agreement was offset by a call for collaboration on "health care, education and assistance to immigrants." U.S. bishops have said Mr. Trump's plans to overhaul the health-care law must ensure no one loses coverage.
The White House is debating whether to withdraw from the international climate-change agreement to cap carbon emissions that world powers reached in Paris in 2015. Mr. Trump was sharply critical of the accord and opposed it as a candidate.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he didn't know if the president and the pope had discussed climate change, but that the subject had come up in the president's meeting later with Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, which Mr. Tillerson also attended.
The cardinal encouraged the president to remain in the Paris accord, and Mr. Trump replied that he hadn't made a final decision, Mr. Tillerson said.

Full text:   VATICAN CITY -- When President Donald Trump visits Pope Francis on Wednesday, at the halfway point of a trip the White House has cast as a pilgrimage of peace, the two leaders will have a chance to reset an acrimonious public relationship.
Yet the two men, famously divided on the pope's signature issues of migration and climate change, could struggle to find significant areas of agreement.
As of last week, representatives of the White House and the Vatican working on the agenda for the meeting had found few common policy priorities, according to someone familiar with the preparations.
Vatican meetings between pontiffs and heads of state are more stagecraft than hard-nosed politics. Wednesday's meeting carries extra weight given the public sparring match last year, when the pope said Mr. Trump's opposition to migration made him "not Christian," and Mr. Trump shot back that questioning his faith was "disgraceful."
"They have a little fence-mending to do. They got off to a bad start," said Jim Nicholson, ambassador to the Holy See under President George W. Bush.
"Everyone knows there are areas of disagreement," said Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington. "It's just important that they're getting together to say, 'What are some of the areas where we have common ground?'"
Mr. Trump stands to gain, amid the many controversies besetting him at home, from images of a friendly encounter with the enormously popular pope. The Vatican is sensitive to the White House's concerns and eager to avoid anything that could appear like a scolding, according to someone familiar with the preparations.
The pope himself has sought to play down the tensions. When asked about the coming meeting with Mr. Trump, he said that "we need to look for the doors that are at least slightly open, to enter and talk about the things we have in common, and to go on. Step by step."
On the eve of his departure, Mr. Trump said: "I look forward to speaking with the pope about how Christian teachings can help put the world on a path to justice, freedom, and peace."
Abortion, an issue uniting the Trump administration and American Catholic bishops, is a point of common ground, but isn't a priority for the pope.
Pope Francis has made a priority of addressing global warming, describing it as a real threat to life on the planet and calling for cutting fossil fuel use to stem it. The White House, to the contrary, is deciding whether the U.S. should withdraw in full from the Paris Agreement to cap emissions.
A main goal of Mr. Trump's foreign trip -- outreach to the Muslim world -- is in principle one that could appeal to Pope Francis, who has fervently promoted close relations with Islam.
Pope Francis and Mr. Trump have both voiced concern for besieged Christian minorities in the Middle East, but the Vatican's call to increase aid for displaced Christians and other minorities in the region clashes with the White House's aim to cut budgets.
With the two differing on migration, only narrow areas of that theme, such as combating human trafficking, are likely to bring them together.

Full text:   The world's largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years.
New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that's needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries' growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies.
While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It's tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge.
Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn't whether this immense turning point will happen -- it's when.
Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry.
Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., say peak demand isn't in sight.
But some big European producers predict that a peak could emerge as soon as 2025 or 2030, and they are overhauling their long-term investment plans to diversify away from crude oil. Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Norway's Statoil SA are placing bigger bets on natural gas and renewables, including wind and solar.
"Nobody knows" when demand will peak, says Spencer Dale, group chief economist for BP PLC, which issues a widely watched annual outlook. The company's base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s -- with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. "There are huge bands of uncertainty around that," Mr. Dale says.
The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand.
Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists.
Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies' shareholders.
The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about.
"We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand," says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. "It's because you have this threat of disruptive technology" such as electric vehicles, she says. "If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That's why it's so hard to forecast."
Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp. voted this month to ask the company to assess long-term impacts of climate change on its business. It was the first time such a proposal passed at a major U.S. oil-and-gas company. BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution
Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million.
During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry's ability to develop new supply.
Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage.
Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France's Total SA says he wouldn't be surprised if it happens by 2040.
But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world's need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 mpg, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use.
Chevron's outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world's energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia's national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050.
"The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old," says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, "there has been a backlash against the idea," especially by American companies.
For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Mr. Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. "There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles."
Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. "Our belief is peak demand isn't in sight," he told the audience.
To predict how demand is likely to grow -- or, eventually, shrink -- companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures.
Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn't come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars' demand for gasoline.
Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can't yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then?
Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest "X" factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos.
For decades, Americans' love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years.
Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can't crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows.
But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand.
Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA's main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency's prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040.
Mr. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction -- and he's doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles -- there's still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks.
"Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth," Mr. Birol says. "There's barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow."
Mr. Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector -- to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts -- is still expected to increase.
BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today -- but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand.
"EVs aren't a game changer," says Mr. Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company's CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.)
Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand -- or two million barrels a day -- to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn't expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world's fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables.
But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Waerness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason his company's peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP's. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Saetre said recently.
Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations.
Part of BP's forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people -- about a quarter of the world's population -- will move from low to middle incomes.
"When that happens, your demand for oil increases," says BP's Mr. Dale. "You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car."
To come up with Statoil's 2030 peak-demand forecast, Mr. Waerness, the company's chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world's population -- especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China.
"I'm not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai," Mr. Waerness says. "They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040."
Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. "When they get rich, they'll want to travel to exciting places."
Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad.
Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly.
"To us, it's real," says Statoil's Mr. Saetre. "The future has to be low carbon."

Abstract: Occidental, in its proxy, urged investors to vote against the proposal, saying it was already working to expand its disclosure of how climate-related issues are relevant to its risk management practices and to explicitly incorporate climate-related risks and opportunities into its scenario planning process.

Full text:   In a first at a major U.S. oil-and-gas company, shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp. voted to ask that the company assess the long-term impact of climate change on its business.
Occidental opposed the proposal, which calls for an annual report starting in 2018 that includes environment-related scenario planning. One of those evaluations would be assessing the risks the company could face under efforts to limit global warming to a temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius.
The company hasn't disclosed what percentage of votes the climate resolution received, but acknowledged the shareholder support for it. Occidental said it would release that percentage in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days.
"We look forward to continuing our shareholder engagement on the topic and providing additional disclosure about the company's assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities," said Eugene L. Batchelder, Occidental's chairman.
The proposal that passed Friday is nonbinding. Occidental is among a number of U.S. oil-and-gas producers under pressure from shareholders to address climate change and other environmental risks to their businesses. The company is a significant oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, and also has drilling operations outside the U.S. in places like Colombia, Oman and Qatar.
The Nathan Cummings Foundation, which led the proposal along with Wespath Investment Management, said the vote puts the oil-and-gas industry on notice that investors are looking more seriously at climate issues.
"It's hugely significant," said Laura S. Campos, director of corporate and political accountability at the Nathan Cummings Foundation.
Occidental, in its proxy, urged investors to vote against the proposal, saying it was already working to expand its disclosure of how climate-related issues are relevant to its risk management practices and to explicitly incorporate climate-related risks and opportunities into its scenario planning process.
BlackRock Inc., the world's largest money manager by assets, supported the climate resolution, an indication that financial management firms are beginning to think differently about energy investments. This is the first time BlackRock voted for a shareholder proposal on climate risk that company management opposed.

Full text:   President Donald Trump won't make a decision on whether to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change until after he meets with Group of Seven leaders this month, the White House's top spokesman said.
Mr. Trump will wait to make his decision because he "wants to make sure that he continues to meet with his team to create the best strategy for this country going forward," press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday.
White House officials had been expected to soon close an internal debate on whether the U.S. should withdraw or take more-measured steps, but a key meeting on the matter scheduled for Tuesday was postponed at the request of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who would have been unable to attend, an administration official said.
Mr. Trump's decision to wait until later this month to render an official verdict comes as a blow to advocates of withdrawing from the climate-change accord, since the G-7 summit in Italy will allow advocates of the agreement to press the president not to withdraw.
One G-7 leader, French President-elect Emmanuel Macron, urged Mr. Trump not to dismantle the accord in a phone callon Monday. European Union and other individual European governments, including the U.K., have sought to convince Mr. Trump that sticking with the Paris deal would better serve American interests, an EU official said.
During his campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to withdraw from the agreement completely. Two weeks after his election in November, he said he had an "open mind" about the pact among 190 countries.
Under the Paris Agreement, each participating country determines its own set of emissions targets and a plan to reach them. The U.S. had pledged to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025.
The European diplomatic push comes as thousands of government, environment and business representatives gathered this week in Germany for United Nations talks on guidelines to implement the landmark accord.
Europe's effort highlights a growing urgency to maintain participation by the U.S., the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China. To sway the U.S. president, the agreement's supporters have proposed that the U.S. could roll back emissions cuts without risking punishment under the accord, a senior European lawyer who helped draft the deal said.
"The Paris Agreement is sufficiently flexible to allow the U.S. to chart its own path," a senior EU negotiator said.
A spokeswoman at the U.S. mission to the EU didn't respond to a request to comment.

Full text:   President Donald Trump has told top aides he wants to decide the U.S. role in the Paris Agreement on climate change, and what course to take will be debated in two high-level meetings at the White House on Tuesday, according to multiple administration officials.
Two weeks after his electoral victory last November, Mr. Trump said he had "an open mind" about the agreement by 190 countries aimed at combating climate change, reversing his campaign pledge to withdraw completely. But after softening other campaign positions on China and NATO in recent weeks, the president may be looking to rebalance his approach on the world stage with a major move reaffirming his commitment to "America First" principles.
The faction for withdrawing completely is led by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, senior adviser Steve Bannon and White House counsel Don McGahn, several officials said. They are eager for the decision ahead of the G-7 and G-20 summits later this month in Italy and Germany, respectively, where world leaders are likely to pressure Mr. Trump to stay in the agreement.
France's president-elect, Emanuel Macron, urged Mr. Trump not to dismantle the Paris agreement during a congratulatory phone call Monday, his spokesman told CNN.
But others inside and close to the administration are urging more tempered steps, such as paring the U.S. carbon emission reduction targets.
In a recent Oval Office meeting, Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State in the Bush administration, also implored the president to avoid the diplomatic backlash that could result from fully withdrawing, according to two White House officials.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and the president's daughter Ivanka Trump are all pushing for a more measured response.
Mr. Pruitt and Ms. Trump are scheduled to meet at the White Houseon Tuesdayto discuss the agreement ahead of a second meeting of the principal's committee of the National Security Council that afternoon at which a formal recommendation may be presented.
Environmental groups, alarmed for weeks over the rising possibility that the administration may withdraw, have been preparing a response should that occur and simultaneously attempting to undercut the White House's legal rationale for pulling out.
Mr. McGahn has argued that remaining in the Paris Agreement could lead to litigation should the administration ratchet down its carbon emission reduction limits, according to administration officials. Mr. McGahn declined a request for comment.

Full text:   State Street Corp. launched its SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Free exchange-traded fund with much fanfare in December 2015, its debut timed to coincide with the Paris climate talks and its credibility burnished by support from the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the most prominent environmental lobbying groups in the U.S.
Despite the ETF's name, it owned stakes in, for example, Transocean Ltd., the offshore-drilling company implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; Southern Co., a utility that relies on coal and natural gas for 80% of its generating capacity; and Valero Energy Corp., a major gasoline refiner.
As demand for do-gooder investing increases, particularly among women and millennials, fund managers are retooling their lineups to include funds that appeal to a wider audience. These loosely defined strategies offer a feel-good tilt while still preserving broad market exposure, which muddies the difference between responsible funds and their plain-vanilla peers.
The lack of industrywide definitions makes reliable statistics hard to come by.
The Global Sustainable Investment Alliance estimates that assets pegged to environmental, social and governance strategies, or ESG, ballooned to a record $22.9 trillion at the start of 2016, making up 26% of professionally managed money world-wide.
Yet many asset managers disclose few details about how they use ESG criteria, according to a report from the alliance's U.S. organization. Some analysts include solar- and wind-energy funds. Others don't. Some funds adhere to "biblical" values that critics call homophobic. Some funds, like the State Street ETF, own stock in companies that are blacklisted by competitors.
"It's a very slippery space," said Elisabeth Kashner, head of ETFs for FactSet, a data and analytics firm. "There's no consensus on what's ultimately good or bad, nor is there consensus on how to measure it."
Last August, State Street changed the name to clarify the fund's strategy of avoiding firms with coal, gas and oil reserves such as Exxon Mobil Corp. It is now called the SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF.
"There is no ironclad, crystal-clear, broadly consensual, industry definition of how to invest, or not invest, in fossil fuels," said Chris McKnett, head of ESG investments at State Street, who said the change was made for the sake of "precision and clarity."
ESG investing traces its modern roots to the antiapartheid divestiture campaign of the 1980s, which prodded companies to withdraw from South Africa to protest the country's institutionalized racial segregation. After apartheid was dismantled, ethical investing focused on boycotting heavy polluters and human-rights violators. As concerns about climate change increased, investors began looking for ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their portfolios without sacrificing diversification and performance.
ESG became an increasingly popular solution. Instead of using market value to determine how much to allocate each company, like most traditional indexes, the strategies weight their investments based on how a company performs on ESG criteria.
Some funds go a step further, using financial criteria like revenue or dividends combined with ESG scores.
Since the start of 2016, the ETF industry has launched 26 new ESG funds, according to FactSet and XTF. Firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., State Street and OppenheimerFunds, have also published research touting the performance-enhancing benefits of ESG screening. Some fund managers believe that ESG screening can weed out companies with simmering scandals, said Sharon French, head of beta solutions for OppenheimerFunds.
She cited MSCI's July 2013 ESG downgrade of Volkswagen AG due to corporate-governance problems, more than two years before the Environmental Protection Agency announced its investigation into emissions cheating.
Such strategies preserve diversification, but can make for strange bedfellows. For example, the Columbia Sustainable Global Equity Income ETF includes Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum Corp. among its top 20 investments; and, at one point, the single largest holding of Oppenheimer's Global ESG Revenue ETF was Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a company excluded from other ESG strategies because of its history of labor problems, though that may change as the company improves its ESG performance. The fund liquidated its Wal-Mart stake in February after MSCI noted "significant concerns" related to labor unions and an ongoing bribery case against its Mexican subsidiary, Oppenheimer's Ms. French said.

Full text:   The Lovers (May 5)
Spouses who usually sleep with their backs turned to each other are shocked to wake face to face one morning and in mid-kiss. The long-married pair, Mary and Michael, played by Debra Winger and Tracy Letts, won't even dress when the other is in the room. Neglectful and unfaithful, they have become adept at managing their affairs -- Michael's mistress comes up as "WORK" on his cellphone -- but they find that secret relationships can get messy, too. Soon, they are exchanging playful texts and cheating on their lovers with each other.
-- Ellen Gamerman
The Big Sick (June 23)
Writers Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon based this comedy on their stranger-than-fiction courtship. The Pakistan-born Mr. Nanjiani, who plays Dinesh on HBO's "Silicon Valley," stars as Kumail, a stand-up comic whose Muslim parents expect him to enter an arranged marriage. Instead he falls for Emily, played by Zoe Kazan, after she heckles him at a show. In short order, Emily suffers a grave illness that lands her in a medically induced coma, leaving Kumail to navigate the crisis alone with her parents. Director Michael Showalter said though he and Mr. Nanjiani are old friends, he never knew about this experience until he read the script. "The things about the story that are not true are the less crazy parts," he said. Judd Apatow and Barry Mendel produced the film, which sparked a bidding war after its debut at Sundance.
-- Ellen Gamerman
Baby Driver (June 28)
In one way an old-fashioned heist movie about a criminal looking to run away with his girlfriend after one last job and in another a cutting-edge melding of music and movie, "Baby Driver" may be the most daring film of the summer. Ansel Elgort never removes his earbuds and the music he listens to provides the soundtrack of the picture and the tempo of his frenetic car chases. Co-starring Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey, it's yet another mixture of commercial tropes and alternative comedy from cult favorite director Edgar Wright ("Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot Fuzz").
-- Ben Fritz
The Beguiled (June 30)
Sofia Coppola's first film since "The Bling Ring" follows the civil war that breaks out when a wounded Union soldier (Colin Farrell) is taken in by a 19th-century girls' school in Virginia. Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning and longtime Coppola muse Kirsten Dunst star as the women whose insulated lives are riven by his arrival and the seduction he brings to the estate. Ms. Kidman, who starred in the spring hit "Big Little Lies" on HBO, appears to continue her streak of intense turns here. A recent "Beguiled" trailer features her blood-soaked and asking for a saw.
-- Erich Schwartzel
The House (June 30)
It's been 10 years since "Blades of Glory" brought Amy Poehler and Will Ferrell together on the big screen. Now the former "Saturday Night Live" cast members reunite for this comedy inspired by gangster movies, playing Scott and Kate Johansen, parents who realize they never started a college fund and now can't afford to pay for their daughter's dream school. Their bank account mystifies them. "It says right here we have $401,000," Scott tells their financial planner. "That says you have a 401k account," she replies. To make money, the couple opens an illicit casino in the suburban home of their best friend, played by a scene-stealing Jason Mantzoukas. "It's always fun to drive by houses in the suburbs and go, 'I wonder what goes on in there,'" said director Andrew Jay Cohen. "Ripping off the mask is always fun."
-- Ellen Gamerman
A Ghost Story (July 7)
Casey Affleck, fresh off his Oscar win for "Manchester by the Sea," stars in another meditative drama about family loss with "A Ghost Story," about a young husband who is killed in a car accident and returns from the afterlife to visit his wife (Rooney Mara). The movie, from "Moonlight" distributor A24, received solid reviews after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, with critics praising its artistry and tackling of big ideas through a small story.
-- Erich Schwartzel
Patti Cake$ (July 7)
The film is set in a New Jersey town that commuter trains speed through on their way to someplace better. White, overweight rapper Patricia "Killa P" Dombrowski, played to critical acclaim by newcomer Danielle Macdonald, would like to tear out of there, too. Stuck working in a karaoke bar where her mom gets drunk for free, making up dirty "limmies" (limericks) to entertain her wheelchair-bound grandma, she finds her salvation in an eternally optimistic rap partner and an outcast who calls himself the antichrist. The movie left the Sundance Film Festival this year with strong buzz and a distribution deal with Fox Searchlight.
-- Ellen Gamerman
Dunkirk (July 21)
Christopher Nolan is one of the only directors in Hollywood who can make an "event" out of movies without a superhero, robot or monster. "Dunkirk" is his boldest effort yet. It is a retelling of a World War II battle in which Allied forces, many of them British, tried to escape from the French coast. Shot entirely on large-format Imax film with scenes that put viewers in a plane, on a boat, or stranded at the edge of the beach, "Dunkirk" has been described by Mr. Nolan as the "ultimate suspense story."
-- Ben Fritz
An Inconvenient Sequel (July 28)
More than 10 years after his documentary on climate change won an Oscar, former Vice President Al Gore returns to the cinematic lectern with a sequel that further examines the consequences of global warming. The movie will debut with a wide theatrical release that is rare for a documentary. Mr. Gore already is using the film to speak out against President Donald Trump's climate policies.
-- Erich Schwartzel
Detroit (Aug. 4)
The film again pairs Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal, whose collaborations include "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty." This time the result is a historical thriller about the racially charged 1967 riot in Detroit that brought the state police and National Guard into the city. John Boyega -- Finn from "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" -- plays a security guard caught in the middle of the crisis. The trailer focuses on the police clash with civilians at the Algiers Motel, which resulted in the murders of three black men and the brutal beatings of several others. The film chronicling one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in the country's history over five days in July lands just after the 50th anniversary of the riot.
-- Ellen Gamerman
The Only Living Boy in New York (August 11)
Woody Allen won't be in theaters this summer but this film from Marc Webb, the "500 Days of Summer" director returning from his time making two "Spider-Man" sequels, feels like the closest thing to his work. Callum Turner stars as a young college graduate dealing with the revelation that his father is having an affair. In one scene, Jeff Bridges talks his young co-star into admitting he is attracted to his father's mistress, played by Kate Beckinsale, and admonishes him to "stop grounding yourself in what you think is moral."

Full text:   "Green bond" issuance is growing fast, part of the overall trend of do-good investments becoming more popular. And U.S. fund companies are looking to tap into investor demand for these bonds, which finance environmentally friendly projects from green infrastructure and real-estate development to energy-efficiency initiatives.
About $81 billion of green bonds were issued last year, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, a nonprofit that promotes the debt market as a way to raise money for projects related to climate change. It expects $150 billion of green bonds to be issued this year, compared with just $3 billion in 2012. These figures cover "labeled" green bonds, meaning they have been reviewed externally and meet certain definitions, including those of the Climate Bonds Initiative.
A range of private and government organizations have issued green bonds, from Apple Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp. to municipalities, New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the governments of France and Poland. They have proved popular with investors, with most of the issues oversubscribed, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative. "These are no longer niche investments," says Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research.
The growth of the market has sparked interest from fund companies, with the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund focused on green bonds -- the VanEck Vectors Green Bond ETF (GRNB) -- launched in March.
The ETF was launched to meet growing investor demand for environmentally focused products, says Edward Lopez, head of ETF product management at VanEck, an investment-management firm based in New York. The green-bond market has grown large enough in recent years to allow for an ETF to be listed, he says.
The fund tracks the S&P Green Bond Select Index, which was launched by S&P Dow Jones Indices last month to track the most liquid segment of the broader S&P Green Bond Index.
The S&P Green Bond Index had an annualized return of negative 0.81% over the five years through the end of March, compared with negative 0.39% for its parent index, the S&P Global Aggregate Developed ex-Collateralized Index, which tracks the performance of a broad range of investment-grade debt around the world.
The VanEck ETF was launched on the heels of the Mirova Global Green Bond fund (MGGYX), a mutual fund that launched in late February. Mirova, a subsidiary of Natixis Asset Management that focuses on sustainable investment, had already launched a green-bond fund in Europe, the Mirova Green Bond-Global fund.
"Both institutional plan sponsors and wealth-management advisers are hearing demands from their participants and clients for investments with positive impact," says Kenneth St. Amand, vice president and client portfolio manager at Mirova, explaining the impetus behind the Mirova funds.
The two new U.S.-listed funds join Calvert Green Bond fund (CGAFX), a $74 million mutual fund that was launched in October 2013 by Calvert Investments, one of the original sustainable-investing firms.
The Calvert fund takes a broad approach, investing both in labeled green bonds and in the bonds of companies it considers to be leaders on environmental issues. For example, the fund will buy any bond issued by Apple -- even if a bond doesn't finance an environmentally friendly project -- because of the tech giant's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, says Vishal Khanduja, the fund's portfolio manager.
However, the fund's makeup has changed over the years, Mr. Khanduja says. The percentage represented by green bonds has increased with the growth in their issuance, so that they now account for more than half of the fund's assets.
The U.S. is behind Europe in the listing of green-bond funds; there are several in Europe that aren't open to U.S. investors. That includes the Lyxor Green Bond UCITS ETF, launched in late February by Lyxor Asset Management, part of the Paris-based Societe Generale Group, which just beat VanEck's GRNB as the world's first green-bond ETF.
There are numerous Europe-based mutual funds focused on green bonds, including the Allianz Green Bond fund, the AXA WF Planet Bonds fund and NN Investment Partners' NN (L) Euro Green Bond fund. BlackRock Inc. launched a Europe-listed Green Bond Index fund in March, while State Street Corp.'s State Street Global Advisors operates the State Street Global Green Bond Index fund in Europe.
Europe has shown greater interest in the green-bond market than the U.S., in terms of both issuance and investor demand, says Chris McKnett, head of State Street Global Advisor's global environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investments business.
He points to several reasons, including the relatively early issuance of green bonds on the continent by organizations like the European Investment Bank in 2007 and the World Bank in 2008, which helped foster an investor base.
About 37% of the green bonds outstanding, by face value, are denominated in euros, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, the most for any currency. Mr. McKnett says that bodes well for the market's further development there, because potential issuers will be confident the market can support new supply.
Still, the number of U.S. dollar-denominated green bonds has grown quickly over the past year or so, and they now account for 36% of the global total. Mr. McKnett says State Street would consider launching a U.S. fund, "given the increasing level of awareness and burgeoning state of the market."
Brown Advisory, an investment-management company based in Baltimore, is aiming to launch a mutual fund focused on green bonds before the end of this year, says Thomas Graff, head of fixed income. The firm currently includes green bonds in a number of the accounts it manages for it clients. "I believe that more and more investors are going to be thinking about sustainability issues," Mr. Graff says.
One potential drawback of mutual funds and ETFs focused on green bonds is that they still have a relatively narrow universe to choose from, despite the recent growth of the market, says Jon Hale, head of sustainability research at fund tracker Morningstar Inc.
There are other funds that take a broader approach and therefore have a greater range of bonds to choose from, while retaining an ESG theme, Mr. Hale says. He points to the TIAA-CREF Social Choice Bond Fund (TSBRX), a $1.1 billion fund that invests primarily in intermediate-term investment-grade bonds that meet certain ESG criteria, in areas from affordable housing to renewable energy.
Still, the green-bond market looks set to continue growing, and the new mutual funds and ETFs are crucial in opening access to individual investors, as well as raising the profile of climate change as an issue, says Sean Kidney, chief executive of the Climate Bonds Initiative. "Once you own a green bond, you also start engaging with the whole issue," he says. "You start thinking 'There are solutions, I can do something.' "

Abstract: General Electric Co. CEO Jeffrey Immelt defended efforts to reduce emissions and fight climate change, after President Donald Trump reversed rules that pushed U.S. utilities to use cleaner-burning fuels. In a blog post to employees Wednesday, Mr. Immelt highlighted the administration's move and said climate change "should be addressed on a global basis through multinational agreements" such as the 2015 Paris Agreement. The U.S. hasn't withdrawn from that agreement, but the executive order on Tuesday fed concerns that the pact's targets will be hard to reach.

Full text:   General Electric Co. CEO Jeffrey Immelt defended efforts to reduce emissions and fight climate change, after President Donald Trump reversed rules that pushed U.S. utilities to use cleaner-burning fuels.
In a blog post to employees Wednesday, Mr. Immelt highlighted the administration's move and said climate change "should be addressed on a global basis through multinational agreements" such as the 2015 Paris Agreement. The U.S. hasn't withdrawn from that agreement, but the executive order on Tuesday fed concerns that the pact's targets will be hard to reach.
"We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted," Mr. Immelt wrote. "We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges."
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has voiced support for President Trump's new policy, saying fewer regulations would lower energy costs and spur economic growth. But many big U.S. corporations have pledged support for the Paris Agreement and efforts to reduce emissions.
"The science is clear and unambiguous: Climate change is real and human activity is a factor," closely held Mars Inc. said this week, adding it was "disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations."
On Tuesday, the world's biggest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, committed to get 100% of its global electricity from renewable sources by 2025. "Cutting back on fossil fuels is good for the environment and good for business," CEO Carlos Brito said.
Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Darren Woods, who took over from Rex Tillerson when he left to join the Trump administration, said earlier this year that "climate risks warrant action" and called the Paris deal "an effective framework" for dealing with rising emissions.
GE's Mr. Immelt has managed to avoid conflict with President Trump, who on occasion has lashed out at companies via Twitter. Mr. Immelt, who visited the White House in February, supports some administration initiatives, such as revising the tax code. At the same time, he has defended globalization amid nationalistic and protectionist trends in many countries. In his post, Mr. Immelt said firms have to "have their own 'foreign policy'" and "learn to adjust to political volatility all over the world."

Abstract: European officials issued rebukes and officials around Asia said they would continue their drive toward cleaner fuels after President Donald Trump laid the groundwork to reverse his predecessor's climate-change policies.

Full text:   European officials issued rebukes and officials around Asia said they would continue their drive toward cleaner fuels after President Donald Trump laid the groundwork to reverse his predecessor's climate-change policies.
Mr. Trump, citing the need to revive the U.S. coal industry and ease the regulatory burden, began on Tuesday to repeal the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan of stricter carbon-dioxide limits on utilities.
The change leaves an opening for China and other countries to seize leadership in the global effort to curb the rise in temperatures, as set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which went into force in November.
The U.S. move raised questions about what steps, if any, the Trump administration would take to comply with the Paris commitments.
"I think it's a disaster, not only for the U.S., but a global disaster," Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Union's executive branch, which helped broker the Paris agreement, said on Wednesday of Mr. Trump's move. He said the EU "has to advocate the need to stick to the agreement reached in Paris. I insist on talking to our American partners."
China, the biggest emitter of climate-changing gases, won't change its climate-change policies, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Wednesday. "We still advocate that all sides should move with the times, grasp opportunities, fulfill their promises and earnestly take positive action to jointly promote implementation of (the Paris) agreement."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump Tuesday took steps to begin unraveling the centerpiece of the Obama environmental agenda, signing an order to reverse rules aimed at pushing U.S. utilities to shift from coal plants to cleaner-burning fuels.
"My administration is putting an end to the war on coal," Mr. Trump said ahead of the official signing at the Environmental Protection Agency, repeating a campaign slogan he used to champion policies he said would bring back mining jobs.
He said he was paring back regulations that impeded job creation, while still ensuring clean air and water.
But while the moves are being billed as job savers, companies and energy experts said the order is unlikely to reverse the U.S. utility industry's shift to natural gas, solar and wind as leading sources of electricity.
The order begins a formal review of President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, which would have required utilities to reduce power plant carbon-dioxide emissions to 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. It also initiates a review of a regulation that would impose tougher emissions requirements on new plants.
It further pulls back 2016 guidance from the Council on Environmental Quality on climate change and official estimates of the social cost of carbon, methane and nitrous oxide and rescinds a temporary ban on new coal leases on federal lands, which Mr. Obama's Interior Department issued early last year.
The moves are all but certain to trigger legal and political pushback from environmentalists, and Democrats announced swift opposition on Tuesday. The actual repeal could take years as the litigation and rule-making process run their course. The White House on Monday night acknowledged it would likely take "some time."
"Ultimately, litigation will keep these agencies on course, but this order is a big waste of time and effort, done to appease a dirty industry and right-wing climate-denial fanatics," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat.
The White House action is part of a broad push across the government to rein in what Republicans and businesses say is a burdensome and costly regulatory environment created under the Democratic administration. It also gave the president an opportunity to move beyond the difficult collapse of health-care legislation in the House last week and hand a win to allies who have fervently opposed the power plant rules.
The move also raises questions about what steps, if any, the Trump administration might take to comply with a global pact to address climate change that roughly 200 nations agreed to in Paris in 2015.
The order Tuesday drew a rebuke from the European Union.
A senior White House official said Monday that the Trump administration hasn't reached a decision on how to proceed with the Paris agreement.
While companies and energy experts said Tuesday's move may extend the life of some aging coal-fired power plants, there are other factors at work.
Many energy companies face state requirements to increase renewable power generation and are under pressure from investors such as pension funds and university endowments to clean up their operations.
Cheap U.S. natural gas unlocked by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has prompted many companies to scrap older coal plants in favor of gas-fired plants, which require fewer workers to operate.
Companies are also taking advantage of tax credits for renewable power to build out solar and wind farms, which are becoming more cost-competitive with fossil-fuel generation thanks to economies of scale and advances in technology.
Nearly 700 institutions valued at more than $5 trillion have pledged to divest themselves from fossil-fuel companies, according to a December report by consulting firm Arabella Advisors.
And many utilities are already orienting themselves toward cleaner fuels.
Duke Energy Corp. said it planned to invest $11 billion in natural-gas and renewable power generation over the next 10 years, as the company aims to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions by 35% from 2005 levels, by 2026.
That represents a long-term company strategy and isn't likely to change, Duke Chief Executive Lynn Good said in a February interview.
Southern Co. plans to invest at least $1 billion a year over the next five years in new wind farms. It now uses natural gas to generate 47% of its power. Coal provides 31%, nuclear 15%, and hydropower, wind, solar and other renewable sources 7%.
"Going forward, we anticipate an increase in renewable generation capacity and declining utilization of coal," said Terrell McCollum, a spokesman for the Atlanta-based utility.
Still, the symbolism surrounding the action was important for Mr. Trump and loyal constituencies in the mining industry, where the power plant rules were viewed as a government betrayal for regions whose mines had long provided steady employment.
Shares of some coal companies jumped on news of the order. Peabody Energy Corp., which is exiting bankruptcy, rose 15.8% to $2.20. Arch Coal Inc. rose 1.85% to $69.

The moves are all but certain to trigger legal and political pushback from supporters of the Obama administration's policies on the climate, who include Democrats and environmentalists.
The official said it was likely that the review of the Clean Power Plan could take "some time" to run its course because of the federal rule-making process, and the prospect of litigation.

Full text:   George P. Shultz and James A. Baker ("We Thought We Would Hit Your Sweet Spot," Letters, March 10) offer a lengthy polemic in apparent bewilderment as to why their tax scheme to cure a postulated "threat of climate change" was not better received. Climate change caused by carbon dioxide is assumed by the authors to be a global malady in need of a cure -- their tax cure.
Scientists recognize that change is a normal attribute of climate on all geological time scales, yet a unique tax rate of $40 per ton of carbon (carbon dioxide) is claimed to cure "a potential threat of climate change." The authors assume that carbon dioxide is a prime driver of global climate but offer no proof. Dangerous anthropogenic climate change secondary to the burning of fossil fuels remains an unproved hypothesis, in spite of billions of dollars spent in the attempt. Years of claims of climate catastrophes that never come to realization and computer climate-modeling failures challenge the leading role given carbon dioxide in climate-change hypotheses.
The authors note that "energy producers support this notion" of a carbon tax. As any production costs or "carbon dioxide tax" are passed onto taxpayers and consumers, such producers have no reason to oppose it, and may well support it for public-relations reasons. Smoke-and-mirrors tax policies typically leave the taxpayer on the short end of the deal as those versed in government machinations well know. That is the real threat.

The trouble with the Shultz-Baker carbon tax proposal is that it is a purported solution to a nonexisting problem. There is no measurable evidence to back the hypothesis that man-made CO2 emissions will cause runaway global warming. At its very heart, that concept predicts that greenhouse warming will first show up circling the Earth in the troposphere over the equator. To the contrary, there is actual evidence based on 37 years of satellite measurements that no such warming has taken place. Without greenhouse warming in the troposphere, there is no basis for EPA regulation of CO2 emissions, and no need for a carbon tax or cap-and-trade tax. Remember, CO2 is not a pollutant under any definition.

Messrs. Shultz and Baker should Google "carbon dioxide." The first thing that comes up is "Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth" (Wikipedia). Contrary to the left's common mantra, it is not settled science on the extent of man's influence on global warming. To propose a tax on carbon dioxide, which they state in their letter, is to propose a tax on what humans exhale, which is also food for plants. There was a time when the Earth was much warmer and Greenland was green. And it is also a fact that the climate is always changing and more people on the Earth die from cold than from heat.

Taxing the successful producers who have earned their money and redistributing it as welfare payments to those who haven't is what's wrong with the carbon-tax proposal because it punishes the good and rewards the undeserving. I implore the American people and politicians to fight against this altruism that is undermining the American principle that money is private property that morally belongs to the person who earned it.

Abstract: Days before the Journal editorial was published, ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Darren Woods lauded a revenue-neutral carbon tax, saying it "would promote greater energy efficiency and the use of today's lower-carbon options, avoid further burdening the economy, and also provide incentives for markets to develop additional low-carbon energy solutions for the future." [...]energy efficiency, largely achieved by creatively responding to prices rather than to regulation, has already delivered more energy savings since the Arab oil crisis than every other new energy technology combined.

Full text:   It's hard to believe that the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal would oppose a conservative, free-market, revenue-neutral, limited-government, internationally competitive approach to the potential threat of climate change that would eliminate the heavy hand of government regulation by the EPA -- and is supported by many of America's major oil- and gas-producing companies. But that's exactly what the board did in its Feb. 25 editorial "The Carbon Tax Chimera."
The Journal, whose sage editorial writing we have admired over the decades, lists several problems with our proposal for a levy on carbon that would not grow government, but instead would be returned to all Americans in the form of a dividend of the revenues raised. Some of the Journal's concerns are speculative while others are just flat wrong. But more important, the editorial criticizes an approach supported by some of the very industries that would pay the proposed levy.
Days before the Journal editorial was published, ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Darren Woods lauded a revenue-neutral carbon tax, saying it "would promote greater energy efficiency and the use of today's lower-carbon options, avoid further burdening the economy, and also provide incentives for markets to develop additional low-carbon energy solutions for the future." The man Mr. Woods replaced as Exxon's head, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, voiced support for a carbon levy during his recent Senate confirmation hearing.
Neither Mr. Woods nor Mr. Tillerson have expressly backed our proposal. Nor have other oil companies. However, their overall vision for carbon control mirrors ours. And energy producers such as BP, Shell, Duke, PG&E, Exelon, BTE and Calpine also share an interest in a revenue-neutral carbon tax as a way to eliminate stifling regulations.
If energy producers support this notion, then why doesn't the Journal?
The newspaper's biggest concern seems to be that once enacted, revenues from the carbon tax will be diverted to other government programs and not returned to Americans in the form of a dividend. That won't happen if the enabling legislation provides criminal penalties for any bureaucrat who tried to do that.
The Journal also says there is no guarantee that the EPA and other regulations eliminated under this plan would not be reimposed by a future Congress. Of course, one cannot control what a future Congress might do. But the best hedge against this is the election of more Republicans to the White House and Congress.
Further, the Journal is wrong to assume that the revenue-neutral carbon levy would be regressive. An average family of four would get a $2,000 annual dividend, and a study indicates that the bottom 70% of Americans would get more money returned to them than they would spend in higher energy costs. Hardly regressive.
Yes, as the Journal suggests, revenues from a carbon levy could decrease as energy producers reduce their carbon output. But this is the first time either of us can remember when the Journal was opposed to a decrease in taxes.
Ours is a tax on carbon dioxide, not, as the Journal says, on fossil fuels. The regulatory state wants to prohibit fossil fuels. Our alternative lets the marketplace react to an incentive. Fossil-fuel use could even go up. For example, a carbon tax would reward the development of new technologies like carbon capture and sequester, which could keep fossil fuels alive and well for the foreseeable future. If fossil fuels can deliver energy most cheaply and cleanly, then by all means we should continue to use them. It's those people who prefer the current regulatory state with the government picking winners and losers that are a threat to fossil fuels. Actually, energy efficiency, largely achieved by creatively responding to prices rather than to regulation, has already delivered more energy savings since the Arab oil crisis than every other new energy technology combined.
The Journal questions the effectiveness of our proposed border adjustment, which would place a tariff on imports from countries that don't have equivalent carbon control in place, and would rebate to our exporters levies theretofore paid when exporting to a country without corresponding carbon control. If climate change is indeed a problem, it is a global problem, and the United States cannot try to address it alone. It needs assistance from other emitters, especially China and India.
The Journal also says that we promote a "stick in the eye" to Canada and Mexico. A carbon tax and a dividend, however, would put us in line with our North American neighbors. Mexico already has a modest carbon tax on some fuels and is removing consumer subsidies as part of their own energy reforms. Across Canada's four largest provinces, meanwhile, 85% of Canadians live under a rising carbon price. And one of them -- British Columbia -- returns some of those revenues back to its people through a simple dividend. The U.S. content of 40% of our imports from Mexico would already contain the impact of our carbon tax, as would 25% of our imports from Canada.
We would have thought that a conservative, free-market, revenue-neutral, limited-government, internationally competitive, carbon-control proposal would be right in The Wall Street Journal's sweet spot, unless of course the Journal does not agree that there is a potential threat of climate change.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- At the request of President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, language critical of a global climate deal was struck from an executive order that Mr. Trump is planning to sign soon, according to multiple people familiar with the move.
Mr. Trump is expected to sign within days at least two executive orders that will begin the process of trying to dismantle former President Barack Obama's climate and environmental regulations.
Mr. Kushner, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, and Ms. Trump, the president's eldest daughter, intervened to strike language about the climate deal from an earlier draft of the executive order, according to these people.
The executive order, which targets Mr. Obama's climate agenda, now includes no mention of the climate deal, which nearly 200 nations struck in Paris in 2015, in large part due to a strong push by the Mr. Obama's administration.
One White House official said both Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have been considered a moderating influence on the White House's position on climate change and environmental issues. The move is the latest sign of influence Mr. Trump's daughter and Mr. Kushner have in a White House that has seen internal divisions on a variety of issues, including foreign policy.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to cancel the climate deal and said it hurt U.S. companies. He has said once since the election that he would be open to remaining a part of the accord, though his top advisers have since maintained that Mr. Trump doesn't take seriously the issue of climate change.
Ms. Trump, in particular, has said that she wants to focus on addressing climate change during her father's administration.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt on Friday to be President Donald Trump's administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, a move that kicks off the president's push to roll back Obama-era climate and environmental regulations.
Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who was confirmed in a 52-46 vote, faced opposition from most Democrats, who said the nominee didn't sufficiently satisfy their concerns about his connections to fossil-fuel companies in Oklahoma.
One Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, voted to oppose his nomination. Mr. Pruitt won the backing of two Democrats from states with big fossil-fuel interests: Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.
As soon as next week, Mr. Trump's administration intends to issue directives scaling back high-profile EPA regulations, including a rule cutting carbon emissions from power plants and another bringing more bodies of water under federal jurisdiction, according to several people close to the administration. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on the directives.
Former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, mounted an ambitious effort to enact rules aimed at the environment, especially climate change, during his last years in office. The next few years are likely to see an all-out war over how much of that legacy will be preserved, including U.S. participation in a landmark climate-change accord.
Mr. Trump, a Republican, has said he doesn't think climate change is a real issue, and Mr. Pruitt has also questioned the scientific consensus that human activity is a major contributor to climate change.
The top concern raised by Senate Democrats is Mr. Pruitt's alleged lack of response to requests for some 3,000 emails between him and fossil-fuel companies, which Democrats say are likely to reveal he would have major conflicts of interest.
Thursday, a state judge in Oklahoma ordered the attorney general's office to release the emails by next Tuesday, prompting Democrats and environmentalists to say Mr. Pruitt's confirmation vote should be delayed. But the Senate by then had already cast a procedural vote to begin debate, and Republicans declined to delay a final vote.

Full text:   Holman Jenkins writes: "Two measurements separated by less than the margin of error are the same" ("Change Would Be Healthy at U.S. Climate Agencies," Business World, Feb. 4). This statement is fundamentally untrue and, were it to be accepted by policy makers, would have severely negative consequences for the evaluation of evidence. The concept of margin of error is meant to recognize that, while the point estimate (in this instance, temperature) should be viewed as the most accurate one, there exists a degree of uncertainty. To imply that this uncertainty completely negates the underlying assertion is equivalent to believing that one can't make a judgment without complete information. Saying two measurements are within the margin of error doesn't mean that the predicted relationship isn't true, but rather that scientists aren't "X" certain. This "X" is generally equal to 95%, though not always. But it is always significantly greater than 50%.
Mr. Jenkins is correct in saying that scientists should be more explicit in recognizing the degree of uncertainty in their measurements. But he in turn should recognize that, in a complex world, we must rely on probabilities as the basis of decision-making.

Statistics? Margin of error? Confidence intervals? Don't be absurd. None of these things matter at the altar of Climate Religion.
As a petrochemical industry engineer who cares deeply about climate change, I am keenly aware of this. Most people, however, aren't going to be upset over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration omitting basic statistics when they believe that climate Armageddon is nigh. But they miss the larger point.
From autonomous cars to the potential to genetically engineer your offspring or yourself, proper and fact-based scientific debate in the public sphere will be paramount in this century. If those debates are conducted in the same frenetic and emotional fashion that climate is being debated, we should all be concerned about how we might be branded or persecuted for our opinion. We owe it to future generations not just to make the right decisions on climate, but also to conduct our debate on the issue in a manner consistent with the scientific method we claim to cherish.

Full text:   George Shultz and James Baker III provide "A Conservative Answer to Climate Change" (op-ed, Feb. 8). Their plan offers so many economically efficient and effective alternatives to today's administrative-state patchwork of regulations that the conservative answer to climate change raises the question: What could possibly go wrong? In the real world of revenue-starved Washington, with political power bouncing between left and right based on a few million swing voters and close to zero trust in government, a carbon tax and dividend to be followed by deregulation is ripe for abuse. How much bureaucratic slippage will occur between collection and distribution? Is a guarantee of post-tax deregulation more rock solid than were the guarantees of long-term budget-deficit reduction after short-term federal spending increases?
From a purely economic standpoint, the Shultz-Baker proposal has a great deal to like. Politically, the plan might help bridge the enormous gap between conservatives and reasonable environmental activists on the left. Unfortunately, Americans cannot trust their representatives to stick with any plan for new taxes, tax rebates and deregulation for any period longer than a two-year election cycle. Democrats could retake the White House and Congress and double the carbon tax, convert the dividend-payment plan into an income-redistribution plan and restore any climate-change regulations weakened or abandoned after carbon-tax implementation.

The carbon tax proposed by Messrs. Shultz and Baker is still a net cost to the economy even if the tax is refunded to taxpayers. Replacing less expensive energy with more expensive energy will slow economic growth. It's better to rely on competitive market forces to develop energy sources that are less costly than fossil fuels.
We need more disinterested climate research, not more taxes.
Ed Kahl

A CO2 tax, unlike a cap-and-trade program, doesn't guarantee any level of CO2 reduction, only a flow of cash to the government. For a time the Obama administration attempted to "convolute" the successful SO2 cap-and-trade concept and turn it into a giant government ATM by mandating a government auction for all proposed CO2 allowances issued, and thus was born the phrase "cap and tax." There are better ways to address the carbon issue than though more government taxation.

An "increasing tax" on American businesses is a terrible idea. Australia tried a carbon tax and then repealed it after rising energy costs hurt consumers, devastated the coal industry, killed jobs and contributed to a sluggish economy.
President Trump has already made strides in his work to turn around the U.S. economy with actions that are actually conservative and pro-growth. He needs to reject any voices from the past that push for new taxes on the American people.

Full text:   The First Amendment sky is not falling as a result of the recent decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals permitting climatologist Michael Mann's case to proceed against the National Review Online, despite the claims of NRO's attorneys Michael A. Carvin and Anthony Dick in "A Libel Suit Threatens Catastrophe for the Climate of Public Debate" (op-ed, Feb. 6). In this litigation, Dr. Mann is challenging NRO's accusations that he engaged in scientific fraud when he published his "hockey stick" graph demonstrating the considerable rise in the earth's temperatures. Messrs. Carvin and Dick assert that this decision is catastrophic for public debate because their client was simply "questioning" Dr. Mann's work and "voicing one's opinion."
To the contrary, NRO's efforts to characterize its false accusations of fraud as some sort of contribution to public debate ignores the fundamental difference between genuine opinion and knowing or reckless falsehoods. Protected opinion has its limits; fake news doesn't qualify. This has been the law for decades, and in a delightfully ironic twist the court repeatedly cited a 1976 defamation case successfully pursued on this very ground by none other than William F. Buckley -- the founder of National Review. The Buckley decision drew the sharp distinction between protected opinion and knowing falsehoods. The Mann v. NRO decision does nothing different; the First Amendment remains alive and well and undisturbed.
Messrs. Carvin and Dick also tell us how their position is supported by certain "friend-of-the-court briefs," including one filed by an organization called the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. It should be pointed out to your readers that a member of this committee is News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal.

I favor freedom of the press, but I disagree vehemently with Messrs. Carvin and Dick. Certainly, any publication should be able to say that someone's scientific data is suspect or that, in the opinion of the writer, the data was manipulated incorrectly. To say, however, that Mr. Mann fraudulently presented material and to compare him to Jerry Sandusky, who exploited in the most heinous way, young men, cannot possibly be considered in the same category as challenging data or its interpretation.
Along with that, in my judgment, Mr. Mann's charges of "fraudulent denial of climate change" and "corporate payoffs for knowingly lying about the threat climate change posed to humanity" should also be attacked as slander (or libel).

Full text:   Academics, librarians and technology professionals are hosting "archive-a-thons" to copy public databases hosted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and other federal agencies, saying they are worried access to the data could be compromised under the Trump administration.
The goal is to ensure the climate, environmental and other data remain in the public domain, according to organizers of the events, which are taking place across the U.S. and in Canada.
"We don't feel like someone's going to flip a switch and turn off webpages," said Jerome Whitington, a faculty member in New York University's department of anthropology who is part of the archiving effort. "One of the easiest ways to attack that stuff is to defund that maintenance. . .We want to ensure that high-quality information is in the hands of people so they can use it."
While President Donald Trump has said nothing specific about cutting off access to data, his past statements about reducing funding to the EPA, during which he called it "the laughingstock of the world," and his administration's moves to clamp down on communications at some federal agencies, have raised concern among scientists about long-term access to data.
The administration's skepticism toward climate science has added to these concerns. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump's pick to run the EPA, said last month that the role of human activity on climate change is subject to continued debate, a statement that runs counter to the consensus of the scientific community.
"Everybody knows [Mr. Trump is] unconventional," said Rush Holt, chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a general scientific society, and a former Democratic congressman. "There's uncertainty about whether evidence has a privileged place in the administration."
White House spokeswoman Kelly Love declined to comment, and the EPA didn't provide a comment.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman Allard Beutel said the agency was "continuing to provide NASA data and information about our research and missions to the public as we previously have been doing."
Scott Smullen, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the agency hadn't received any directives from the Trump administration targeting the availability of NOAA databases. Archivists are also copying NOAA data.
Archiving events have been held in New York, Portland, Ore., and Ann Arbor, Mich., with others planned for California and Boston this month.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal agencies are scrambling to handle a transition between two diametrically different leaders, leading to confusion over what government websites can display and what employees are allowed to do with publicly funded work.
An Environmental Protection Agency spokesman denied media reports from this past week that President Donald Trump's administration was going to delete the EPA's website on climate change.
Meanwhile, incoming Trump officials at agencies including the Interior Department, Agriculture Department and the EPA have demanded a cessation of certain public communication, prompting outcries from some congressional Democrats and progressive interest groups.
Many experts say the new administration's moves aren't that different from past power transitions. What has changed, some say, is a rapid-fire social-media scene and a new president facing opposition not seen in decades.
"The technology across the board from 2008 has dramatically advanced," said Frank Maisano, a media strategist at Bracewell, a firm representing primarily fossil-fuel clients.
Mr. Maisano said there were concerns after the 2000 election when there was a shift from a Democrat to a Republican.
"People were worried about George Bush, but they weren't as worried as they are with Donald Trump," he said.
The moves to quiet public communication, which included taking down some web pages, such as the Whitehouse.gov page on climate change, fueled concern among scientists and others that the new administration is clamping down on hot-button issues related to science.
Mr. Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly expressed doubts about the scientific consensus that human activity is a major contributor to climate change.
Twitter activity has cropped up in recent days seeking to rebut the administration's actions, including unofficial accounts depicting opposition by EPA, National Park Service and Health and Human Services.
A transition official at the Interior Department said certain unauthorized messages sent out under the name of some national parks were removed or dealt with at the agency level, not at the direction of the White House.

CDC Climate-Change
Summit Postponed
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it recently postponed a gathering it had planned to hold next month on the effects of climate change on health.
The agency informed partner organizations and participants after Donald Trump was elected president but before he was inaugurated. The CDC took the step out of caution rather than responding to a directive from the incoming administration, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed late last year to cut off funding of international climate-change initiatives.
The Climate Change and Health Summit was organized to bring scientists and public-health practitioners together to discuss implementing climate-related health initiatives such as heat-wave-preparedness plans, predicting and monitoring the spread of infectious disease, emergency preparations for severe weather and other issues, said Howard Frumkin, a former director of the CDC Center for Environmental Health and a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington School of Public Health. Dr. Frumkin was among those who were invited to attend the conference.
The CDC made the decision itself to cancel the meeting, he said. "It's a truly important science-based health topic," he said. "If this heralds an era for timidity about controversial issues, then we all need to be worried."
Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, one of the partners in the summit, said "there were lots of discussions" with the CDC and other partners after the election about whether to go ahead with the summit, given the president-elect's stated views on climate change. "Everybody was concerned about how this would be perceived," he said.
The CDC said that it began notifying registered participants on Dec. 22 that it would "postpone" the meeting. But it gave no reasons for halting plans for the meeting, and was vague about rescheduling. "We are exploring options toreschedule the meeting while considering budget priorities for fiscal year 2017" as well as an American Public Health Association meeting on the same topic this year, the agency said.
News of the CDC's decision on the summit was reported Monday by E&E news, a publication for energy and environment professionals.

GEORGE H.W. BUSH
Ex-President Moves
Out of Intensive Care
Former President George H.W. Bush has been moved from intensive care at a Houston hospital, and his wife has been discharged, a family spokesman said Monday.
Mr. Bush, 92 years old, was admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital on Jan. 14 for shortness of breath. He was moved to intensive care Wednesday.
Dr. Amy Mynderse said that Mr. Bush has suffered from bacterial pneumonia and is making daily improvements. He was moved out of intensive care and onto a regular floor at the hospital on Monday, said family spokesman Jim McGrath.
Barbara Bush, his wife of 72 years, was discharged from the hospital Monday after being treated for bronchitis, Dr. Mynderse said.
Mr. Bush had a breathing tube removed Friday. On Monday, he was still using "minimal" supplemental oxygen, according to Dr. Mynderse.
Mr. Bush could be discharged Friday or over the weekend if his rate of improvement continues, Dr. Clint Doerr said.
Mr. Bush, the 41st president who served from 1989 to 1993, has a form of Parkinson's disease that requires him to use a motorized wheelchair.

WEATHER
Deadly Southeast
Storm Moves North
A storm that killed at least 19 people in the South this weekend barreled toward the mid-Atlantic and Northeast states Monday, with the year's first nor'easter promising to bring high winds, heavy rain and possible flooding up the coastline.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office said New York City and Long Island residents should prepare for the possibility of moderate coastal flooding Monday evening. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation will have utility vehicles and boats in the water ready to assist residents if needed.
In Massachusetts, that state's emergency management agency warned Monday that the storm will bring sleet, snow, high winds and possible flooding Monday afternoon into Tuesday.
The National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center said it received five tornado reports Sunday, one in Alabama and the rest in Georgia.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is looking to take action within days to reverse former President Barack Obama's climate agenda and show its commitment to promoting fossil-fuel infrastructure, according to people familiar with the plan.
The anticipated actions would come in addition to other commitments President Donald Trump has made to repeal a raft of environmental regulations issued by Mr. Obama during the past eight years, especially a high-profile measure cutting carbon emissions from power plants and a water-pollution rule.
Presidential directives ordering the Environmental Protection Agency, which issued both regulations, to begin work to repeal them are likely within days, although the actual repeal could take years.
The additional moves include actions to advance the Keystone XL oil pipeline and a push to remove greenhouse-gas emissions as an element of environmental reviews of new projects.
The Trump administration didn't respond to a request for comment.
Sources close to the White House cautioned that the precise timing and method of repealing the policy items haven't been set. Based on staff announcements to date, Mr. Trump doesn't have a policy adviser on energy issues at the White House.
The actions, taken collectively, suggest Mr. Trump is committed to following through on pledges to promote fossil fuels and virtually eliminate the U.S. government's focus on climate change. The efforts are certain to face pushback from environmental groups, congressional Democrats and Democratic state attorneys general.
The executive-branch steps Mr. Trump's aides are considering action toward approving the Keystone pipeline, which Mr. Obama rejected in November 2015. This could mean, in part, rescinding an executive order first issued by President Lyndon Johnson in 1968 that gives the State Department authority over cross-border oil pipelines such as Keystone. That would lay the groundwork to more quickly approve the project, though exactly when and how that would occur is unclear, according to people close to the administration.
A spokesman for TransCanada Corp., the developer of Keystone, said the company is fully committed to the project, which was first proposed almost a decade ago. "However, we are sensitive to the fact that the federal government is in a transitional period," the spokesman said in an email. "Out of respect for that process we're not in a position to discuss the project."
During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he would approve Keystone, but he also called for a piece of the profits. It isn't yet clear how that would be addressed in any approval, according to the people close to the administration.
The status of the Dakota Access pipeline, whose approval the Obama administration delayed in one of its 11th-hour actions, is less clear, according to people close to the White House, due in part to the violence that has occurred in protests over the pipeline's route in North Dakota. That project doesn't cross an international border and current law doesn't require presidential approval for the Dakota Access pipeline as it does for Keystone.
Environmental groups blasted the administration's energy plan.

For White House Focus
The new commander in chief has vowed to accelerate the fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, where U.S. troops since mid-2014 have backed an offensive by local forces to oust the group from its self-declared caliphate. President Donald Trump has said the campaign against Islamic State is his No. 1 priority.
Already, a U.S.-led coalition has conducted more than 16,000 airstrikes on Islamic State targets and retaken well over half the group's territory in Iraq, as well as a swath of the land it captured in Syria.
Beyond Islamic State, Mr. Trump comes into office as the Pentagon is preparing its defenses to counter Iran, North Korea, Russia and China, and has about 5,000 troops in Iraq and nearly 10,000 in Afghanistan.
Mr. Trump has already drawn a red line on North Korea. In a Jan. 2 tweet, he vowed to stop North Korea from developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S.
The future of U.S. defense policy toward Europe may depend on whether the new secretary of defense, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, can persuade Mr. Trump of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's value.
Mr. Trump has criticized NATO as being obsolete and beset by free-riding nations relying on the U.S.
So far, Mr. Trump's comments appear to presage warmer relations with Russia, which could affect policies in Europe and Syria, and colder relations with China. He has enraged Beijing by refusing to commit to the longstanding "One China" policy, by which the U.S. de-recognized Taiwan to establish formal diplomatic relations with China.

Conservative
Court Pick
Expected to
Come Soon
Within two weeks of taking office, President Donald Trump plans to announce a Supreme Court nomination, a move to restore a conservative majority on the divided bench that many Republicans feared was lost when Justice Antonin Scalia died in February.
In making his pick, Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he will follow the guidance of a conservative legal establishment that has directed the GOP approach to judicial appointments since the Reagan administration. Leaders of the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers network, helped Mr. Trump identify 21 potential Supreme Court nominees; he in turn won their confidence by promising to appoint one to the vacancy.
The list includes several state supreme court judges. But people close to the process say the front-runners remain names long familiar in Washington: conservative judges who have demonstrated their ideological bona fides through service on a federal appeals court -- yet remain young enough to serve on the high court for two or more decades.
Mr. Trump's nomination for the Supreme Court comes after Republicans stymied President Barack Obama's March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The blockade of the center-left jurist, whom the White House saw as a consensus candidate, infuriated Democrats, and new Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has vowed to oppose Trump nominees who are "out of the mainstream."
Mr. Trump's list begins with William Pryor of the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit and Diane Sykes of the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit. At a Republican debate hours after Justice Scalia's death, Mr. Trump named both as "fantastic people" who might fill his shoes.

Environmental Rules
Set to Be Early Targets
At the top of the new administration's energy and environmental agenda will be unraveling its predecessor's policies on everything from carbon emissions to water.
Much of the early action will focus on rolling back regulations. President Donald Trump has said he would withdraw President Barack Obama's signature policy to address climate change, a rule that cuts power-plant carbon emissions. The rule already has faced legal challenges and has been temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court.
The Trump administration, with the help of the Republican-controlled Congress, also will work toward repealing an Environmental Protection Agency rule bringing more bodies of water under federal jurisdiction. Also targeted for repeal: Interior Department rules that require tougher standards for coal mining near streams and that set new standards for emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and natural-gas wells on federal lands.
While the Trump administration can't unilaterally repeal most rules on its first day, it has several options. The EPA and other agencies can immediately start the process of withdrawing regulations, and they can relax compliance requirements over time. Meanwhile, Congress can pass measures nullifying rules that have been completed most recently.
Mr. Trump has said he would pull the U.S. out of the global climate agreement adopted in Paris in 2015. Mr. Trump's choice for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing he thought the U.S. was better served staying in the deal than withdrawing, but he said Mr. Trump would make any ultimate decision.

Health-Care Battle Revs Up
President Donald Trump has entered the White House grappling with a lightning rod in the thicket of U.S. domestic-policy issues -- health care.
The president's party has already begun working on the repeal -- and potential replacement -- of former President Barack Obama's signature health-care law, but the task of reworking a sweeping social program six years into its lifespan is proving messy.
Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have put forward various ideas to serve as alternatives to the major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions of Americans but also triggered criticism over rising premiums for some users and insurer withdrawals.
The GOP has yet to unify behind a single plan, and it remains unclear how much influence Mr. Trump and his administration will exert, and how much the president's team will leave to four congressional committees and other groups of lawmakers to hash out in Congress.
Ultimately, that decision comes down to several questions, including how much backlash Mr. Trump is willing to endure to remake health care along GOP lines and how closely Republicans can work with Democrats to pass alternative legislation. Democratic votes would be needed for some measures to get through the closely divided Senate.
A handful of centrist Senate Republicans, meanwhile, could also curb their party's ambitions to remake U.S. health policy. The GOP's margin of power in the upper chamber is a slender 52-48, leaving little room for defections.
The president has said he wants Congress to act quickly to undo the law and enact new legislation. He personally favors allowing people who buy insurance on their own to fully deduct premiums on their tax returns. He also supports enabling people in one state to buy coverage from an insurer in another.
On some health-care matters, however, Mr. Trump differs from conservative orthodoxy. He has repeatedly criticized drugmakers, signaling he would like to ease rising pharmaceutical prices by allowing consumers access to medications from overseas or giving the government a greater role in negotiating drug purchases for Medicare.
Shares of drugmakers fell sharply when Mr. Trump repeated such remarks at a Jan. 11 news conference. Health care represents almost one-fifth of the U.S. economy.

Nuclear Deal
With Iran
Now Faces
A Tough Test
The deal the U.S. and five other world powers reached with Iran to curtail the country's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief has been heavily criticized by President Donald Trump.
In a recent interview with the Times of London and Germany's Bild, Mr. Trump said the accord was "one of the worst deals ever made" and that he was unhappy with it -- though he declined to say whether he would scrap the agreement, as he had on the campaign trail. Mr. Trump's national-security appointments signaled in confirmation hearings that the new president wouldn't tear up the accord right away, if at all.
Retired Gen. James Mattis, Mr. Trump's nominee for defense secretary, said last week that the U.S. should closely monitor Iran's compliance with the accord rather than get rid of it altogether. Rex Tillerson, Mr. Trump's choice for secretary of state, said he would recommend that Mr. Trump do a full review of the nuclear deal.
The nuclear deal took effect in January 2016, after the world powers announced its completion in July 2015 and following staunch Republican opposition, as well as concerns from Gulf Arab allies and Israel.
President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials had voiced some optimism the deal might usher in an era of cooperation with Iran, but it has continued destabilizing behavior in the Mideast since the deal's implementation.

Immigration Revamp Likely
After campaigning for the White House promising hard-line immigration policies, President Donald Trump now has the opportunity to implement them. In some cases, he can act alone; other changes will require congressional approval.
The most immediate -- and politically fraught -- question regards a program that gives temporary work permits and safe harbor from deportation to about 750,000 young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Mr. Trump has promised to kill the program, but these so-called Dreamers are a sympathetic group. He recently promised to "work something out" but hasn't said what that might be.
Mr. Trump is also set to overhaul former President Barack Obama's system of immigration enforcement, which targeted illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes but reassured others that they probably wouldn't face deportation. Mr. Trump says he, too, would focus on criminals, though he has also said all 11 million undocumented immigrants would be subject to deportation. Stepped-up enforcement under his administration is expected.
Expect the new administration to pressure "sanctuary cities" -- jurisdictions across the country with policies limiting how much local officials assist in immigration enforcement efforts -- to cooperate with federal authorities. Federal agencies may be able to cut off some grant funding to these cities right away, though withholding other federal support would likely require legislation.
Mr. Trump built his campaign on a pledge to build an "impenetrable physical wall" on the U.S. border with Mexico. He said that he would begin work on "day one" and that Mexico would pay for it.
Republican lawmakers are considering appropriating money needed for increased border security in spending legislation that must pass by April. That could put the project on a fast track, though many say they envision additional fencing rather than a wall. At a recent news conference Mr. Trump insisted, "It's not a fence. It's a wall."
Mr. Trump also acknowledged that U.S. taxpayers would be paying the bill, but promised that Mexico would reimburse the U.S. later. Mexican leaders say they won't.
Conservative immigration activists are most eager for Congress to require all employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of potential employees.
Mr. Trump backs this idea, and it likely has sufficient support in the House. It is unclear whether Senate Republicans would be able to overcome a near-certain Democratic filibuster.

Trade Talk: Separating Bark
From Bite in Tariff Threats
In coming months, President Donald Trump will show how serious he was about deviating from Washington's free-trade orthodoxy and using the threat of tariffs to address what he calls the unfair trade practices of China, Mexico and other countries.
Mr. Trump and his key advisers have criticized the global trading system as unfair because the U.S. market is more open to freely traded goods and investment than some other economies.
"Free trade doesn't mean anything," Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 13. "It's not free if China sends its products here and we can't send our products there."
Mr. Trump has said that as soon as Day One of his administration he'd pull the U.S. out of the unratified Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade agreement that the Obama administration signed with 11 other nations around the Pacific, not including China. The U.S. should remind other countries that it can restrict $2.2 trillion in imports to right alleged wrongs coming from trading partners, he said.
Since his victory, Mr. Trump has played down earlier threats of imposing tariffs of 35% or more on goods made in China, Mexico or other countries and shipped to the U.S. In recent weeks Mr. Trump has focused on persuading U.S. companies to hire domestically instead of abroad.

Fight Over Tax Plan Looms,
Including With the GOP
The new administration has a chance to guide the biggest tax-policy changes since 1986 into law, but that is likely to require a complex, drawn-out, politically challenging fight.
Despite near-unanimous Republican agreement on cutting marginal tax rates, the party is conflicted over offsetting the revenue loss to the government. President Donald Trump is already clashing with members of his own party in Congress on a crucial piece of their plan, and other divisions loom when lawmakers wade further into details.
Tax policy is poised to occupy much of the 2017 agenda in Congress: House Republicans are writing their plan, and they see Mr. Trump's election as a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Mr. Trump will be looking to deliver on his promises of huge tax cuts.
The breadth of his ambitions could cause fractures. Mr. Trump campaigned on a multitrillion-dollar tax-cut plan. Even with aggressive economic growth assumptions, his campaign didn't assume the tax plan could pay for itself. Congressional Republicans say they are trying to make their plan roughly revenue-neutral by broadening the tax base.
To do that, House Republicans proposed several measures to broaden the U.S. tax base while they cut the top individual tax rate from 39.6% to 33%, the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% and the rate on business income reported on individual tax returns from 39.6% to 25%.

Full text:   Donald Trump's cabinet picks took a tough line Wednesday on Chinese trade practices and federal environmental regulations, reflecting the president-elect's antiestablishment agenda.
The president-elect's nominees in last week's confirmation hearings -- many chosen for national security posts -- took pains to show they could be independent from Mr. Trump on foreign-policy matters. This week, the designees facing senators represented the leading edge of Mr. Trump's push to reverse the domestic policies advanced by President Barack Obama's administration.
The would-be leaders of agencies overseeing the environment, health care, commerce and education represent Mr. Trump's plans to disrupt the status quo by battling the agencies they hope to lead. Mr. Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, testified that the agency made its own laws and ignored the role of states in environmental regulation.
"EPA is an administrative body. It is not a legislative body," he said.
Senate Democrats accused the Republican president-elect's nominees of putting special interests before the public welfare.
"This is a swamp cabinet full of bankers and billionaires," said U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the Senate's Democratic leader. "Many of them have hard-right views."
Last week's hearings, by contrast, were punctuated by sporadic Democratic praise for nominees who were, at times, out of step with some of Mr. Trump's positions. His chosen border security chief said a wall along the southern border wouldn't alone keep out illegal immigrants, while Mr. Trump's national security picks split with the president-elect on the threats posed by Russia and Iran and the military's use of torture.
Praise from Senate Democrats was scarcer this week, as the latest set of nominees on Capitol Hill were accused of seeking to bulldoze the bureaucracies they have been tapped to oversee. The tension underscored the main battle lines separating the two political parties.
"Trump was elected because voters saw him as an agent of change, and change is what they're going to get in these cabinet nominees," said Peter Wehner, who worked in the last three Republican administrations.
Many of the nominees drew praise from Republican senators, who see the new administration as bringing a long overdue course-correction in policy.
"Over the last eight years the Obama administration has advanced a radical environmental agenda," Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.) said.
Referring to Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Inhofe said, "Scott has proven himself to be an expert at balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship."
Some GOP senators took a more cautious tone during the confirmation hearing of Rep. Tom Price, a Georgia Republican nominated by Mr. Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Price has devoted significant time as a lawmaker to writing plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and he is expected to play a major role in representing the new administration in that effort.
Two Republicans, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine, used the confirmation hearing to say they were wary of repealing the law without a firm plan to replace it.
Mr. Price said he was committed to "bipartisan, team-driven policy-making" and didn't provide details on the incoming administration's vision for a new health-care law.
But he addressed the Republicans' intent to replace the current law when he said: "One of the important things that we need to convey to the American people is that no one is interested in pulling the rug out from anybody."
Democrats, who have little power to block the nominees, used the hearings to flesh out positions that they see as too conservative.
Mr. Pruitt, who as Oklahoma attorney general has repeatedly sued the EPA, drew a tart response from Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, when he said the climate was changing and human activity has an impact, but his opinion was "immaterial."
"Really?" said Mr. Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year. "You are going to be the head of the agency to protect the environment, and your personal feelings about whether climate change is caused by human activity and carbon emissions is immaterial?"
Mr. Obama sought to make climate change part of his legacy through tighter rules on coal plants and automobile emissions. Mr. Trump has criticized the federal government for excessive environmental regulation, a view shared by Mr. Pruitt.
The appropriate role of government was also debated in Mr. Price's confirmation hearing.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who like Mr. Sanders is a leader of the Democratic Party's liberal wing, pressed Mr. Price to heed Mr. Trump's pledge not to cut the Medicare or Medicaid programs. The congressman declined, saying it would depend on the quality of health-care coverage.
"You might want to print out President-elect Trump's statement and post that above your desk in your new office, because Americans will be watching," Ms. Warren said.
The mood was more cordial in Wednesday's hearings for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, tapped to be ambassador to the United Nations, and Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross.
"You have comported yourself quite well," Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, told Mr. Ross.
"Let me assure you that this hearing is a piece of cake compared to some of the other nominees that are going through the process."

White House Allots
$500 Million for Fund
The Obama administration on Tuesday said it was funneling $500 million to a global fund to address climate change.
Mr. Obama has pledged $3 billion to the fund, but until Tuesday, his administration had only committed $500 million, an initial tranche sent in March 2016. The additional $500 million comes from the State Department's fiscal-year 2016 budget, according to a spokesman for Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a senior Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee.
The global fund is part of a broader international effort to address climate change, including a 2015 deal agreed to by nearly 200 countries in Paris. Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said he would withdraw the U.S. from that deal, though since the election he has said he would have an open mind to staying in it. Mr. Trump's transition team didn't respond to a request for comment.

A former "Apprentice" contestant who has accused Donald Trump of making unwanted sexual advances is suing him for defamation, her lawyer said Tuesday, days before Mr. Trump is to be inaugurated as president.
Attorney Gloria Allred said the president-elect "debased and denigrated" Summer Zervos, a onetime participant in Mr. Trump's reality-television show, after she came forward with accusations against him. A representative for Mr. Trump didn't respond to a request for comment.
Ms. Zervos said in October that Mr. Trump touched and kissed her without her permission at a hotel in 2007. Ms. Allred said Mr. Trump spread lies about Ms. Zervos after those statements and has refused to retract them, leading to the defamation claim. She and Ms. Zervos said they will drop the lawsuit if he publicly retracts his statements.

University President
Napolitano in Hospital
University of California President Janet Napolitano has been hospitalized for side effects related to cancer treatment, the university system said Tuesday.
Ms. Napolitano was diagnosed with cancer in late August, the school said, and is nearly done with her treatment. A spokeswoman declined to specify which kind of cancer Ms. Napolitano has.
Ms. Napolitano served as secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama between 2009 and 2013. She was governor of Arizona for six years before that.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is entering a week of potentially tough scrutiny for his selections to reverse Barack Obama's environmental policies.
Democrats have signaled that among Trump officials they will fight the hardest is Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitt, whose confirmation hearing is Wednesday, has indicated he is skeptical that humans are responsible for climate change, and he has challenged an array of Obama environmental rules in court as Oklahoma's attorney general since 2010.
Rep. Ryan Zinke (R., Mont.), Mr. Trump's selection for interior secretary, faces lawmakers Tuesday, and the hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Mr. Trump's pick to head the Energy Department, is set for Thursday.
But Mr. Pruitt's hearing is shaping up as center stage for the battle. Mr. Pruitt has said he would focus on repealing regulations issued by Mr. Obama's EPA, including a centerpiece climate regulation cutting carbon emissions from power plants and another rule bringing more bodies of water under federal jurisdiction.
The Democrats' goal is to paint Mr. Trump's picks as out of step with Americans, scientists and the international community when it comes to climate change. They also hope to grill Mr. Pruitt on his ties to oil, natural gas and coal companies, in particular two political-action committees funded by energy companies that have supported Mr. Pruitt as Oklahoma attorney general.
"Mr. Pruitt has blurred the distinction between official and political actions, often at the behest of corporations he will regulate if confirmed to lead EPA," said a letter sent recently by Democratic members of the Senate environment committee to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.
A spokesman for Mr. Trump's transition team declined to comment on those concerns. A coalition of more than 20 conservative interest groups sent a letter last week urging senators to back the nominee.
In recent years, energy companies have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to two PACs linked to Mr. Pruitt: Liberty 2.0 and Oklahoma Strong Leadership PAC. In many cases, energy companies serving alongside Mr. Pruitt as parties to lawsuits filed against the EPA also contributed to his campaigns.
Both PACs are expected to cease operations this month. Liberty 2.0 initially said it would continue raising money even if Mr. Pruitt entered the Trump administration, but has since changed course. "The PAC's purpose is no longer relevant and its leadership doesn't want its existence to be a distraction," said Charlie Spies, counsel to both PACs.
Mr. Pruitt's supporters say the contributions don't represent a conflict of interest, but rather reflect his understanding that excessive regulation can choke businesses.

Full text:   Rex Tillerson was a 16-year-old janitor at Oklahoma State University earning $1 an hour when his conversations with students working late in labs put him on the path toward an engineering degree.
"I think God put me in that electrical engineering building because I'd be there late in the evenings," he told a group of students at Texas Tech University in 2015. "It's funny how things take you where you're supposed to be."
Mr. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil Corp.'s former chief executive officer, on Wednesday will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a hearing that could lead to his next chapter: serving as President-elect Donald Trump's secretary of state.
While lawmakers are expected to focus on the oil executive's business experience, particularly his work to expand Exxon's footprint in Russia and the company's record on climate change, the 64-year-old native of Texas has a broader range of experiences that have helped him cultivate allies -- both Republicans and Democrats -- who could ease his way to confirmation.
He brushed elbows with Democrats while serving on the board at Ford's Theatre in Washington; he made a friend of a Hillary Clinton supporter while serving on a jury in Texas; and he forged a close relationship with the man who would recommend him to Mr. Trump while serving on the Boy Scouts of America board.
"He's someone who understands 'big p politics' and 'little p politics,'" said lobbyist Heather Podesta, who served with him on the Ford's Theatre board, adding that she has advised concerned Democratic friends to "withhold judgment until you meet him."
Emily Roden, who backed Mrs. Clinton in last year's presidential campaign, got to know Mr. Tillerson in 2007 when they served on a jury in Denton County, Texas. She said he had a key role in helping convict a man accused of sexually assaulting a minor.
"The defense did a very good job of making the facts really muddy. . .he was excellent at thinking very clearly about the case," she said.
Mr. Tillerson's broader experience could help inform those people concerned about whether the contacts he has made while cutting business deals internationally will translate effectively to his new, proposed post.
"Business interests don't always align with diplomatic interests," said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. "Sometimes, the art of diplomacy is about nuance, shades of gray. It's not about the bottom line."
Mr. Tillerson was set to retire from Exxon in March and told friends he was planning to spend time on a ranch in Texas. His coming nomination to be secretary of state, at the suggestion of former Boy Scout president and Defense Secretary Bob Gates, surprised some of those who know him.
As a member of the Business Roundtable, a CEO advocacy group in Washington, Mr. Tillerson pushed for standardized education goals in math and English, which Mr. Trump opposes. At Exxon, he repositioned the company on the issue of global warming, a phenomenon the president-elect has been reluctant to acknowledge.
And as a board member of the Boy Scouts of America, he played a major role in ending the organization's ban on gay scouts in 2013. Mr. Tillerson struggled with the issue, said people involved in the discussions and who spoke with him about the gay ban.
"He thought on it, he read on it, he prayed on it for a long time" said John Hamre, Mr. Tillerson's friend and CEO of Center for Strategic and International Studies. "When he finally made his decision, he said, 'the only thing I could really do is do what was best for the boys.' He decided that meant to change the policy."
Randall Stephenson, the current Boy Scouts president and AT&T CEO, said Mr. Tillerson made sure "every voice was heard."
Gay-rights advocates say his record on the issue as Exxon CEO is more mixed, since the company was one of the last to extend benefits to the spouses of gay employees, doing so in 2013 after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act.
Still, after the Boy Scouts' ban was ended, Mr. Stephenson joked that Mr. Tillerson should next turn his attention to Middle East peace. "I told Rex, 'Maybe you ought to try to tackle the Palestinian-Israeli situation,'" Mr. Stephenson said. "I just said it in jest, but here we are."

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- California legislative leaders said they have hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. as an outside counsel to help in possible legal battles with the incoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump over such issues as climate change and immigration.
In a joint announcement, the state Senate's president pro tempore, Kevin de Leon, and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, both Democrats, said that "with the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for California in the uncertain times ahead."
Mr. Holder, who served as President Barack Obama's attorney general from 2009 to 2015, is now a partner at the law firm of Covington & Burling LLP in Washington and will head a team of lawyers representing the Legislature.
Mr. Holder and his team will be "advising us in our efforts to resist any attempts to roll back the progress California has made," the joint announcement said.
Mr. Holder, in a statement, said, "I am honored that the legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California's residents and policy priorities."
Since Mr. Trump's victory in November, top California leaders have been expressing concerns about the president-elect's possible policies in a range of areas, especially regarding immigration and the climate-change debate.
Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown and other state leaders have pushed policies to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gasses, which they argue contribute to a potentially catastrophic global warming. A spokesman for the governor didn't comment on Mr. Holder's hiring.
Mr. Trump, by contrast, has expressed skepticism about such climate-change worries, at one point calling the issue a hoax. Critics of the president-elect worry that he will try to roll back federal regulations on power-plant emissions and other environmental matters.
In a speech last month, Mr. Brown, who sees climate-change policies as part of his legacy, said,"We've got the scientists, we've got the lawyers and we're ready to fight."

Management: A Year of Uncertainty Looms --- Business leaders face daunting challenges in 2017 amid turbulence world-wide: How much can they trust projections?

Full text:   Here's a prediction for 2017: The job of chief executive will be as tough as ever.
Uncertainty has been a way of life for business leaders since the last financial crisis. But as U.S. President-elect Donald J. Trump moves into the White House powered by a largely unforeseen wave of global revolt against political elites, "2017 is going to be more volatile and more complex than previous years," predicted Michael D. Watkins, a professor of leadership and organizational change at IMD Business School in Switzerland.
The unprecedented turbulence is seen in deep political divisions in the U.S. and abroad, uncertainty over the strengthened U.S. dollar, the faster pace of technological change, mass immigration, terrorism and climate change.
In such a setting, chief executives often must decide how much they trust projections. AMN Healthcare Services Inc. CEO Susan Salka said she doesn't pay attention to public-policy predictions coming out of Washington these days. Demand for health services, she said, will grow regardless of whether the new Trump administration moves to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Ms. Salka said she has stepped up the pace at which she and her team at the medical staffing and recruiting firm make major strategic decisions. In the past 18 months, for instance, AMN expanded into executive search and acquired three search companies -- after hearing from clients whose high-level interim positions remained vacant for too long.
"This has quickly become an important service for us. . . . We are making more swift decisions and being comfortable with the fact that we may not get everything exactly right," she said.
John Crowley, CEO of Amicus Therapeutics Inc., is also trying to embrace the uncertainty, which he likens to drug discovery, where "almost everything we do doesn't work," he said. "Failure happens a lot."
The biotech company, which specializes in treatments for rare diseases, had its first drug approved by European regulators in May. In anticipation of the approval, the company had spent the previous 17 months launching offices in France, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Spain. It established European headquarters in the U.K. -- and then the Brexit vote took Amicus's leaders by surprise.
After conferring with consultants, Mr. Crowley ultimately decided not to change plans for marketing the drug, which treats Fabry disease, across Europe. But the CEO said he worries about changes in regulatory policy -- especially as it relates to the U.S. presidential campaign rhetoric around drug pricing. Like other corporate chiefs, he said he is apprehensive about an environment in which "a tweet can wipe out hundreds of millions in market cap."
The global rise of local populism, evident in the Brexit vote, is a concern for Kennametal Inc. chief Ronald DeFeo. The company makes cutting and drilling tools used in oil-and-gas exploration and other industries.
Mr. DeFeo, hired in February, said he revamped Kennametal's management structure partly to create "much stronger regional leaders" to better serve local markets.
"The face of what we market . . . has to be less about our global capability and more about our local abilities to meet their needs," he said. "We have to be more French in France, more German in Germany, more Chinese in China and more American in the United States."
E.V. "Rick" Goings, CEO of Tupperware Brands Corp. since 1997, said his employer tries to find opportunity in upheaval. For example, he wants Tupperware -- a business long known for its colorful food-storage containers -- to further sharpen its focus on making products that don't come from petroleum or other commodities tied to the U.S. dollar. The company, which pays dividends in dollars, has been hurt by the rise of that currency.
Some chiefs are hitting "pause" on big projects. Bloom Energy Inc., a maker of commercial electric-power generators, had planned to create "at least a thousand jobs" in 2017, mostly in project construction and manufacturing, said its CEO, KR Sridhar.
Unknowns about a Trump presidency prompted Mr. Sridhar to put the Sunnyvale, Calif., firm's job plans on hold until he learns more about the new administration's interpretation of existing energy regulations and formation of new policies.
Deferring plans is "a classic way to react" to an ambiguous environment, said Martin Reeves, senior partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group. "You'll see a lot of postponed commitments," in the coming year, he said. But he warns his executive clients that too much caution can lead to paralysis.
Other leaders are speeding up, making decisions on a shorter time frame.
ConnectOne Bancorp Inc., a community banking firm with 21 locations in New Jersey and New York City, raised $40 million in capital in mid-December. The stock offering came together much faster than usual, said CEO Frank Sorrentino, adding that strong economic projections for 2017 prompted the move. "We started thinking and talking about [the offering] 30 to 45 days ago."

Full text:   LONDON -- Companies should publish an assessment of losses they could suffer through climate change as part of their routine financial statements, according to a panel of financial and business executives chaired by Michael Bloomberg.
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, headed by the former New York City mayor, in a report Wednesday said greenhouse-gas emissions pose a serious risk to the global economy, and investors need better information to assess which firms are most vulnerable to shifting weather patterns and related threats.
"What gets measured better gets managed better," Mr. Bloomberg said in a letter to Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the Financial Stability Board, a group of global regulators that commissioned the report.
The call for greater transparency over climate-related risks is part of a wider push to prod companies to disclose more climate-related information -- a contentious effort which implies that such issues are material to a firm's performance.
It also comes amid heightened uncertainty over the future of efforts to cut carbon emissions following President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election in November. Mr. Trump has pledged to dismantle the Obama administration's climate agenda and chose a climate-change skeptic to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
The panel's recommendations, which include broad suggestions applicable to all companies' financial statements and specific proposals aimed at banks, insurers and the financial sector, will be presented to leaders of the Group of 20 leading economies in July.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump pushed ahead Tuesday with his controversial pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil Corp. chief Rex Tillerson, setting up a likely battle with senators -- including some Republicans -- who have raised questions about his closeness to Russian leaders.
Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, influential voices in the chamber on foreign-policy issues, want to use the confirmation process to explore Mr. Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr. Rubio went the furthest, saying Tuesday he had "serious concerns" about the nominee.
The worries from Republicans signaled Mr. Tillerson could face trouble getting confirmed in the Senate, where he could lose no more than two GOP votes if all Democrats oppose him.
Mr. Tillerson was officially unveiled as the president-elect's choice Tuesday morning after a long interview process that featured multiple candidates, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump called the executive's life story the "embodiment of the American dream" and suggested his business background would empower Mr. Tillerson to cut deals as America's top diplomat.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) praised Mr. Tillerson for his "forward-looking strategic planning, managing international partnerships and risk, and focused leadership around the world." He played down concerns over Mr. Tillerson's ties to Russia by saying he was confident he "will face each problem head on with American interests and security as his top priority."
Mr. Tillerson also has the support of former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former Defense Secretary Bob Gates and former national security adviser Stephen Hadley, the Trump team noted. The three are partners in an international consulting firm that has worked for Exxon.
The Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), who was himself a candidate for the State Department post, said Mr. Tillerson is "a very impressive individual and has an extraordinary working knowledge of the world."
Tom Pritzker, a billionaire Chicago businessman who serves with Mr. Tillerson on the board of the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, described Mr. Tillerson as a "brilliant choice."
"He will be totally focused on U.S. national interests," Mr. Pritzker said. "It's a mistake to confuse knowing Russia with being pro-Russia. Rex knows Russia, which means he's ahead on the learning curve."
Transition officials suggested some centrist Democrats might back Mr. Tillerson given his position on climate change, which he has said is a global problem that warrants action.
Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) a member of the Foreign Relations panel, expressed concerns over what he viewed as Mr. Tillerson's potential conflicts, but said he was "intrigued" by reports the nominee had supported a carbon tax. "I didn't expect that from an oil-and-gas executive," he said.
Mr. Coons added that he was skeptical that would shape the Trump administration's climate policy, given that Mr. Trump last week tapped climate skeptic Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
Exxon has embraced a carbon tax as the best policy to address climate change, and this year the company stepped up its lobbying of fellow U.S. oil-and-gas companies to back a carbon tax over no climate policy at all. The oil giant also backs a global deal struck in Paris last year to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
But Russia appears to be the main concern of senators of both parties. A number of Republicans have signaled they expect confirmation hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee to focus on questions about his relationship and business dealings in Russia, as well as his opposition to U.S. sanctions against Russia. He's also likely to draw similarly tough scrutiny from many Democrats in the Senate.
Under his leadership, Exxon signed a joint agreement with the state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft on a drilling project. Mr. Tillerson was later awarded the Russian Order of Friendship.
Republicans will control 52 seats in the Senate to 48 held by Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them. that means Mr. Tillerson can lose no more than two GOP votes in the Senate if all Democrats oppose him.
The Foreign Relations panel in the most recent session had 10 Republican and nine Democratic members. The panel's composition in the next Congress is still being worked out, but it is likely Mr. Tillerson would need to offset any GOP defections with support from Democrats to win a positive recommendation.
The panel's top Democrat, Ben Cardin of Maryland, said he was "deeply troubled by Mr. Tillerson's vocal opposition to U.S. sanctions on Russia following its illegal invasion, occupation and annexation of Crimea, Ukraine, and his close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin."
Mr. Rubio, a Florida Republican and Foreign Relations committee member, didn't say he would oppose Mr. Tillerson -- only that he would "do my part to ensure he receives a full and fair but also thorough hearing."
Mr. McCain of Arizona, the Republican 2008 presidential candidate, told NPR this week he too had concerns "about what kind of business we do with a butcher, a murderer and a thug, which is exactly what Vladimir Putin is."
Mr. Graham of South Carolina said while Mr. Tillerson was a "talented businessman," he expected "the U.S.-Russian relationship to be front and center in his confirmation process."
Only three cabinet nominees have been rejected in the 20th century and none this century. The last time was in 1989 when former Sen. John Tower, George H.W. Bush's nominee to be defense secretary, was rejected by a Democratic Senate.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump has tapped former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to lead the Energy Department, according to two transition officials, selecting a climate-change skeptic who led the nation's biggest energy-producing state for nearly 15 years.
If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Perry would add a conservative politician to Mr. Trump's cabinet. The Texan would lead a sprawling agency that safeguards the country's nuclear arsenal and directs federal research on energy technologies.
Mr. Perry has mounted two failed presidential campaigns, including as a rival to Mr. Trump in the last primaries, before dropping out early. He faced ridicule in 2011 after forgetting, during a debate, that the Energy Department was one of three federal agencies he promised to eliminate were he elected president.
Mr. Perry, who was governor of Texas for 14 years beginning in 2000, grew up in West Texas and had a long public life in state politics. Before becoming governor, he served as lieutenant governor, agriculture commissioner and spent three terms in the state Legislature.
Mr. Perry has been a reliable backer of GOP energy policies, supporting the Keystone XL pipeline and other priorities of the oil and natural gas industries. Perhaps more than other Republicans, though, he has also shown he backs renewable energy, in particular wind.
In 2005 as governor, Mr. Perry signed legislation that required Texas to sharply increase its dependence on renewable energy. Along with being the biggest producer of both oil and natural gas, Texas also produces the most wind energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.
Mr. Perry also embraces a common Republican line questioning the scientific consensus that human activity is contributing to climate change. In a debate during his recent presidential run, the former governor said that he doesn't think "the science is settled" on climate change, criticizing "the idea that we would put Americans' economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that is not settled yet."
Mr. Perry's position on climate change could face renewed scrutiny in light of a memo sent recently by Mr. Trump's transition team to Energy Department officials. Among other things, the memo asked which staffers have participated in meetings on climate change, raising concerns among some environmental groups that it foretells a shift in the department's funding and a hunt for staffers who worked on climate change.
The Energy Department, which has an annual budget of around $30 billion, was created under President Jimmy Carter following the 1973 oil crisis, but its highest-profile responsibility is overseeing the nation's nuclear arsenal. One of its agencies, the National Nuclear Security Administration, is tasked with maintaining a safe nuclear stockpile and reducing the threat of global nuclear proliferation.

Full text:   Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey won't have to be deposed in Dallas on Tuesday in a lawsuit by Exxon Mobil Corp. against her office after a federal judge reversed his earlier order.
The Monday cancellation by U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade represents the latest development in a potentially lengthy and costly legal fight touched off in June, when the oil company sued Ms. Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman for launching an allegedly illegal investigation into whether the company misled investors on climate change.
The attorneys general, both Democrats, have been exploring perceived discrepancies between Exxon's public statements on global warming and its internal research on climate change over several decades.
On Monday, Judge Kinkeade also ordered the parties to submit briefs regarding whether the court has authority to hear a case involving the two attorneys general.
The standoff between Exxon and the attorneys general has escalated in recent weeks, as prosecutors have fought the unusual order from the Texas federal judge requiring Ms. Healey and possibly Mr. Schneiderman to travel to Dallas to sit for questioning by Exxon's lawyers.
That directive came in addition to another legal rarity: Judge Kinkeade's authorization for Exxon to do more fact-finding, delivered in an opinion that raised questions about whether Ms. Healey's office was investigating Exxon in bad faith.
That step, said some legal observers, is what sets the case apart. Typically, the "bad faith standard" is reserved for a situation in which a judge observes "a level of personal aggrandizement," said James Tierney, program director of the National State Attorneys General Program and the former attorney general of Maine.
"The implications of this are really, really serious," said Mr. Tierney, a Democrat who has worked with attorneys general of both political parties, noting that he believes the effect is that it "chills all legitimate investigations."
A spokesman for Exxon declined to comment. In the past, Exxon has said it follows all financial rules and regulations.
Chloe Gotsis, a spokeswoman for Ms. Healey, called the company's tactics tantamount to an infringement of state prosecutorial jurisdiction.

Cairo Blast Targets
Security Forces
A bombing in Cairo killed six members of the security forces and wounded three others on Friday, Egypt's interior ministry said, in the deadliest attack on the country's military in the capital since May.
The bomb exploded between two police checkpoints on the main road leading to the pyramids at Giza, the ministry said, adding that an investigation was under way.
A group called Hasm, or "Decisiveness," claimed responsibility for the attack. The government suspects the organization is linked to the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood.

JAPAN
Fukushima Cost to
Reach $200 Billion
Japan said Friday that it expects the total cost of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident to reach about $200 billion, nearly double earlier projections, spurring plans for further restructuring of the plant's operator.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it estimated the cost of compensating communities affected by the accident in 2011 would reach 8 trillion yen ($70 billion), up from a previous estimate of 5 trillion yen, while decontamination costs were projected to rise to 6 trillion yen from 4 trillion yen. Meanwhile, a ministry-appointed expert panel said that removing radioactive debris would cost 8 trillion yen, quadruple the earlier projection.
In the accident, which followed a March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami, three of the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant suffered meltdowns. Some towns near the plant remain no-go zones because of radioactivity.

CANADA
Climate Pact Draws
Widespread Support
Canada's Liberal government and the bulk of provinces were set to endorse a pact late Friday to fight climate change, even as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tries to revive the energy sector with the recent approval of two pipeline projects.
The climate pact is expected to endorse a federal carbon-pricing scheme, unveiled in October, as well as plans to phase out coal-powered electricity.
It comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump signals Washington will move to lessen regulation in a bid to drum up more investment in U.S. resource development.
Mr. Trudeau has positioned the fight against climate change as one of his government's signature issues, with the Liberal government aiming to reduce carbon output by 30% below 2005 levels before 2030.

Full text:   Many big corporations continue to support efforts to reduce carbon emissions, vowing to stay the course despite the election of Donald Trump, who has promised to dismantle the Obama administration's climate agenda and chose a global-warming skeptic to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
From Houston to Silicon Valley, executives in the oil, power, retail, transportation and technology industries said their companies were locked into a lower-emissions trajectory driven in part by market forces such as cheaper prices for natural gas and wind power.
Expectations from investors, activists and customers are also factors, along with pressure from regulators in states and other countries, they added.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump called climate change a "hoax" and promised to abandon an international pact reached last year in Paris to reduce carbon emissions.
He also pledged to repeal the Clean Power Plan, an Obama administration rule that aims to cut carbon emissions from power plants 32% by 2030.
On Wednesday, the president-elect selected Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a critic of Obama administration regulations, as his EPA head.
Mr. Trump had promised in an interview since his election to "keep an open mind" on the climate issue and met Monday in New York with former Vice President Al Gore, a climate activist.
While many companies shared their positions with The Wall Street Journal on climate regulations before Mr. Pruitt's selection, several that were reached again afterward, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., said their stance remained unchanged. "Part of our plan to invest in renewables is to diversify our generation portfolio," said Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for utility American Electric Power Co. "All of those investments don't change with a change in administration. It's a long-term strategy."
While the question of how and whether to respond to warming global temperatures continues to be debated in politics, especially among Republicans, many big corporations appear to see the transition to less carbon-intensive energy as a foregone conclusion -- and ultimately good for business.
Companies world-wide committed a record $285 billion to clean-energy projects in 2015, according to a study by the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management.
Days after the Nov. 8 U.S. election, Exxon Mobil Corp. signaled its continued support for the Paris climate deal. Suzanne McCarron, Exxon's vice president of public and government affairs, said on Twitter that the agreement was "an important step forward by governments in addressing the serious risks of #ClimateChange."
Exxon this year lobbied other energy companies to support a carbon tax and to avoid a posture of opposing all regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. Large European oil companies have also pushed for a global price on carbon.
Big utilities that burn coal, such as AEP, say they will continue their transition to cleaner energy sources -- even if Mr. Trump makes good on his pledge to reverse the Clean Power Plan.
"With Donald Trump being elected, I think you'll continue with that movement" regardless of whether the clean-power regulation takes effect, said AEP Chief Executive Nick Akins.
Wal-Mart, General Motors Co., Google and Gap Inc. also said their goals for renewable-energy use or emissions reductions remained intact.
GM set a goal last September to get all its power from renewable sources by 2050. It estimates it is now saving about $5 million a year as a result of that shift and conservation measures. Wal-Mart plans by 2025 to power half its operations with renewable energy and cut its greenhouse gases 18%.
Google said Tuesday it would reach its goal of buying enough renewable energy to match 100% of the amount of power that it uses, about 2.6 gigawatts, in 2017, earlier than it initially expected. It attributed that in part to cheap wind power in Oklahoma, where Google operates a data center.
"We do believe climate change is real and that businesses should do what they can to address it, but we're doing this because it's good for business," said Gary Demasi, Google's director of global infrastructure.
After Mr. Trump's victory, more than 350 companies, including Intel Corp., DuPont Co. and Monsanto Co., signed a pledge expressing support for the Paris climate agreement and U.S. efforts to reduce carbon emissions. That sentiment extends to international companies based outside the U.S.
If Mr. Trump makes good on earlier promises to cancel regulations limiting emissions of carbon dioxide and methane, it would benefit a number of smaller energy companies.
Smaller refinery companies have been pushing hard for an overhaul of the renewable-fuel standard, a federal mandate enforced by the EPA that requires refineries to blend an increasingly large amount of ethanol into U.S. gasoline.

Full text:   BEIJING -- Gov. Terry Branstad, Donald Trump's pick for ambassador to China, has close ties both to the U.S. president-elect and to Chinese President Xi Jinping. He is going to need them.
The 70-year-old Mr. Branstad, who first met Mr. Xi in 1984, is a six-term Iowa Republican governor with little obvious experience in foreign diplomacy. He will land in Beijing at a time when the U.S.-China relationship is increasingly fraught.
Mr. Trump has threatened trade sanctions against China as soon as he takes office. He further roiled the waters by speaking by phone last week with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province and has sought to isolate on the world stage.
Other flashpoints include Beijing's military buildup in the South China Sea, cybersecurity and complaints from U.S. firms that regulatory barriers are helping to keep them out of the Chinese market, even as Chinese companies have aggressively sought acquisitions abroad and in the U.S.
Under President Barack Obama, U.S.-China leadership on combating climate change offered a rare bright spot in the relationship. Such cooperation looks significantly less likely now, as Mr. Trump has said he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accords and has chosen a climate skeptic, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
How effective an ambassador is depends in large part on whether he has the president's ear. Mr. Branstad was an early supporter of the president-elect and campaigned heavily for him in Iowa. The governor's son, Eric, was the Trump campaign's state director.
On the Iowa state government website, Mr. Branstad called his appointment an "extraordinary opportunity" and said he accepted Mr. Trump's "charge to prioritize collaborative policies that will Make America Great Again."
China quickly welcomed the selection of Mr. Branstad, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, calling him an "old friend of the Chinese people."
Messrs. Branstad and Xi first met in China in 1984 as a result of a sister-state relationship between Iowa and Hebei province. The following year, Mr. Xi -- then a rising young agricultural official -- led an animal-feed delegation to Iowa, spending two nights in the home of a Muscatine couple and touring local farms. Mr. Xi visited in Iowa in 2012, shortly before assuming the reins of China's Communist Party, and Mr. Branstad has led several trade delegations to China since 2011.
China's official Xinhua News Agency called the choice a "positive move" and suggested the connections would be helpful. "His longtime relationship with China could help smooth things out. His personal touch could go a long way in avoiding conflicts caused by miscommunication or misinterpretation," it wrote Thursday.
But the former Mexican ambassador to China, Jorge Guajardo, said the extent of Mr. Branstad's closeness to Mr. Trump would be seen in Beijing as ultimately more important. "Then they know they have a direct line," he wrote on his verified Twitter account.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday chose Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, according to a transition official, putting a climate-change skeptic and sharp critic of the agency at its helm.
As the chief legal officer of a major oil and natural-gas producing state, Mr. Pruitt, a Republican, has led legal fights against some of President Barack Obama's most significant environmental rules, and one of his major roles as EPA administrator would likely be to try to roll back those regulations.
That prospect cheered some industry leaders -- many of whom have been frustrated as the Obama administration unveiled far-reaching environmental rules as part of the president's goal of fighting climate change -- while drawing objections from environmentalists concerned over Mr. Pruitt's questioning of climate change.
Harold Hamm, a top energy adviser to Mr. Trump and an ally of Mr. Pruitt's, said Mr. Pruitt would take a different approach to the agency.
"He understands the regulatory stranglehold that the EPA has had on industry during the Obama administration," said Mr. Hamm, founder and CEO of Continental Resources, which is based in Oklahoma City. "I believe that he will work to unleash prosperity in America through the proper use of regulations and adhering to the rule of law."
Mr. Pruitt has touted his leadership role in fighting the EPA rule that cut power-plant carbon emissions, called the Clean Power Plan, as well as an EPA measure that put more bodies of water under federal jurisdiction. Both rules have been temporarily blocked by federal courts as litigation proceeds.
In choosing a legal official to head his EPA, Mr. Trump could be signaling that legal action will be central to carrying out his campaign promises to repeal a host of rules related to climate change and other environmental issues.
"We're very accustomed to the naysayers and the critics," senior Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway said when asked by reporters about criticism of Mr. Pruitt's selection. "Attorney General Pruitt has great qualifications and a good record as AG of Oklahoma and there were a number of qualified candidates for that particular position that the president-elect interviewed. We look forward to the confirmation hearings."
The selection of Mr. Pruitt also reflects a request by some on Mr. Trump's transition team that his cabinet -- heavy on political allies and wealthy business leaders -- should also include state officials and others not closely associated with the president-elect, according to two transition officials.
Mr. Pruitt has been a close ally of the oil and natural gas industry, whose influence in Oklahoma rivals even its clout in Texas. He has pushed back against a group of Democratic attorneys general who are investigating Exxon Mobil Corp.'s handling of climate-change science in recent decades.
Mr. Pruitt has also indicated he questions the scientific consensus that human activity is helping raise the Earth's temperature. "Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind," Mr. Pruitt said in an op-ed that he and Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange wrote in May for the Tulsa World. "That debate should be encouraged -- in classrooms, public forums, and the halls of Congress."
Groups representing U.S. farmers hope Mr. Pruitt will roll back Obama policies they view as burdensome, such as the rule putting more waterways and wetlands under federal protection.
"He should be suited to take on these kinds of abuses and overreaching from the agency, to put the agency back on track," said Ellen Steen, general counsel at the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Energy groups welcomed the selection of Mr. Pruitt, noting his industry- friendly record as a politician from an oil-and-gas-producing state. "We expect that he will consider all of the reliable available data before developing and implementing any new regulation," the International Association of Drilling Contractors said.
But environmentalists were dismayed at the notion of placing someone at the head of the environmental agency who questions the scientific consensus on climate change. "Americans want to transition to clean energy to protect our air, our water and our climate," said climate activist Tom Steyer.
Environmentalists urged the Senate to reject his nomination, although that would be an uphill climb as the chamber is controlled by Republicans. Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), the incoming Senate Democratic leader, said Mr. Pruitt would face tough questions during his confirmation.

Full text:   Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, who met with Donald Trump on Tuesday to discuss becoming his secretary of state, is a seasoned deal-maker whose close ties to Vladimir Putin and other world leaders could redefine U.S. interests abroad.
His emergence as a candidate to be the nation's top diplomat despite having no government experience surprised senior Exxon officials -- including Mr. Tillerson, said people familiar with the matter.
Friends of the 64-year-old Texas oil man, whom they describe as a staunch conservative, said they expect he would consider taking the job as his patriotic duty, and because he is set to retire from Exxon next year. His meeting with Mr. Trump took place at Trump Tower in New York, according to a transition official.
His appointment would introduce the potential for sticky conflicts of interest because of his financial stake in Exxon, which explores for oil and gas on six of the world's seven continents and has operations in more than 50 countries. He owns Exxon shares worth $151 million, according a recent securities filing.
Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, said Mr. Tillerson wouldn't comment.
It is unclear how Mr. Tillerson, a strong supporter of free trade, would fit ideologically with Mr. Trump, who has spoken out repeatedly against trade deals. Little is known of the foreign-policy views held by Mr. Tillerson, who as secretary of state would be expected to handle any changes to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, sanctions on Russia and disputes with China, the subject of repeated barbs from Mr. Trump on the campaign trail.
People familiar with the transition also place Mr. Tillerson, a late entry in Mr. Trump's search for a top diplomat, behind the three top contenders -- Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani and David Petraeus.
Friends and associates said few U.S. citizens are closer to Mr. Putin than Mr. Tillerson, who has known Mr. Putin since the executive represented Exxon's interests in Russia during the regime of Boris Yeltsin.
"He has had more interactive time with Vladimir Putin than probably any other American with the exception of Henry Kissinger," said John Hamre, a former deputy defense secretary during the Clinton administration and president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank where Mr. Tillerson is a board member.
One of the first issues Mr. Tillerson would have to resolve as secretary of state would be his holdings of Exxon shares, many of which aren't scheduled to vest for almost a decade. The value of those shares could go up if the sanctions on Russia were lifted.
The shares would likely have to be sold under State Department ethics rules, Chase Untermeyer, a former U.S. Ambassador to Qatar, said in an interview.
Democrats and environmental activists have accused Exxon of sowing doubt about the impacts of climate change.
Mr. Tillerson has shown ideological flexibility. He helped shift Exxon's response to climate change when he took over as CEO in 2006. He embraced a carbon tax as the best potential policy solution and has said climate change is a global problem that warrants action.

Sanctions on Russia
Blocked Exxon Deal
Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Rex Tillerson struck a deal in 2011 giving Exxon access to prized Arctic resources in Russia, as well as allowing Russia's state oil company, OAO Rosneft, to invest in Exxon concessions all over the world.
The deal would have been transformative for Exxon. Vladimir Putin at the time called it one of the most important involving Russia and the U.S., forecasting that the partnership could eventually spend $500 billion.
But the deal was subsequently blocked by sanctions on Russia that the U.S. and its allies imposed two years ago after Russia's invasion of Crimea and conflicts with Ukraine.
Mr. Tillerson spoke against the sanctions at the company's annual meeting in 2014. "We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions," he said.

Full text:   This month, European oil company MOL Group delivered a stark message to investors: Demand for fuel in its key markets is bound to fall.
Peak oil demand -- when global consumption crests and begins a permanent decline -- is a mind-bending scenario that global producers such as Royal Dutch Shell PLC and state-owned Saudi Aramco are beginning to quietly anticipate. But MOL has a transformation plan that is among the most explicit responses to the trend, indicating how the landscape may change for big energy providers over the next decade.
The Hungarian company is rethinking its traditional focus on fuel supply and shifting investment to petrochemicals, the key ingredient of everyday plastic products and a sector where MOL believes growth will continue even when its fuel business falters.
Although there will still be customers for its fuel, the company reckons demand will soon flatten and then start falling in its Eastern European markets around 2030. "We see that as an inevitability," MOL Chief Financial Officer Jozsef Simola said.
Big oil players such as Exxon Mobil Corp, BP PLC and Saudi Arabia -- which is leading recent efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost oil prices -- are also anticipating significant shifts in demand, though there is no consensus on the timing and their moves have been gradual. They are increasing their investment in petrochemicals, pumping more natural gas, driving down costs and even diversifying into alternative energy sources like solar power.
Last month Shell finance chief Simon Henry caused a stir when he said the company sees oil demand peaking in five to 15 years. Shell's latest published forecasts have consumption flattening toward the end of that period.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corp. quietly issued a report in the summer predicting that China's oil consumption -- a major driver of global growth in recent decades -- will begin to fall by 2030, if not sooner. Global demand is expected to follow suit.
The International Energy Agency, which advises industrialized countries on energy policy, says consumption will continue to rise for decades in its most likely scenario. But that picture shifts radically if governments take further action to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius with more stringent policies like carbon pricing, strict emissions limits and the removal of fossil-fuel subsidies. If that happens, oil demand could peak within the next 10 years, the IEA says.
"The question is more a question of when, rather than if," Dominic Emery, BP's vice president for long-term planning and policy, told the Economist Energy Summit in London this month. BP says oil demand could fall by the late 2020s if tougher emissions laws are enacted.
Others don't see peak demand coming so quickly. Exxon expects consumption to grow through 2040, though at a decelerating pace. Likewise, OPEC sees demand continuing to grow beyond 2040, but acknowledges new technologies and efforts to curb climate change could mean consumption peaks within the next three decades.
Still, OPEC mainstay Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of oil, is pushing its state oil company to invest heavily in petrochemical plants around the world.
The kingdom is trying to diversify away from oil, publicly list Aramco to raise money for other business lines and build a new base of renewable energy.
Peak demand "will be later than the common dates that are being thrown around, but if it does happen, because we're building multiple engines for the economy and we're planning for an economy beyond oil, we'll be ready," Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al Falih, told a conference in Istanbul last month.
Timing and preparing for peak demand are critical to companies' fortunes. Energy producers could move too fast to adapt to shifts that are still years away. That could hurt them by producing too much of next-generation fuels for which demand isn't yet mature. Or new technologies and policies could leave them vulnerable to changes that happen sooner than expected.
"There's risks on both sides," said Paul McConnell, research director of global trends at Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Shell, Exxon and others are pouring money into natural gas -- a less-carbon-intensive fossil fuel they bet will benefit from efforts to curb global emissions.
Several of the world's biggest oil companies are also increasing their focus on alternative energy sources like solar and biofuels.
Peak demand is already arriving in some regions. In Europe, for instance, the IEA sees consumption most likely falling to 10.8 million barrels a day by the end of the decade from 11.7 million barrels a day in 2015.
Those numbers are driving big changes at companies like MOL.
"To come to a point to say that, wow, maybe the future will be different and maybe we have to prepare ourselves for a different world . . . that was not easy for guys like myself," said Ferenc Horvath, head of the Hungarian company's refining and petrochemicals business.

Full text:   MARRAKESH, Morocco -- A conference intended to start putting an international climate-change deal into effect is ending this weekend with diplomats struggling to define how they will move forward as the U.S. retreats from a leadership role.
Facing President-elect Donald Trump's promise to cancel the U.S. commitment to cut carbon emissions, other countries said they would honor their own pledges and hoped the U.S. would do the same.
Some negotiators here said that a shift by the U.S. would make it harder for nations to follow through on their commitments to impose tighter limits on their industries. China's top negotiator said Beijing would press ahead and called on the U.S. to make the "right and smart decision" to stay the course.
India's representative said it would stick with its commitments for now, but was reluctant to say what it would do if the Trump administration abandons U.S. pledges.
A senior member of the Saudi delegation said countries might scale back their efforts without American leadership. "The United States is the backbone of this process, and it will impact this process, no doubt," the Saudi official said.
Mr. Trump has dismissed any danger from climate change, calling it a hoax created by the Chinese.
He said he would withdraw from the Paris deal and end U.S. contributions to a $100 billion fund to help poorer nations address climate change. His team has shown no signs of changing course on climate change since the election.

Full text:   MARRAKESH, Morocco -- Secretary of State John Kerry sought to reassure attendees at a United Nations conference that President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to reverse President Barack Obama's ambitious climate agenda, won't slow global efforts to address climate change.
"I know it has left some here and elsewhere feeling uncertain about the future," Mr. Kerry told the government delegates, climate advocates and business leaders at the conference.
"While I can't stand here and speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue, I will tell you this: In the time I have spent in public life, one of the things I have learned, some issues look a little bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail," the secretary of state said.
The remarks, which came near the end of a roughly hourlong speech, are in line with what nearly all world leaders and other government officials at the conference have said about Mr. Trump following through on his campaign promises.
The president-elect, who has called climate change a hoax created by the Chinese, has vowed to withdraw from the global deal struck last year in Paris to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, and to stop U.S. funding toward a $100 billion global fund to help poorer nations address climate change. He has said he would roll back Mr. Obama's climate regulations, including one cutting carbon emissions from power plants that is the pillar of the U.S. commitment to the Paris deal. The Obama administration was instrumental in crafting and ratifying the Paris deal.
"And no one, no one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the U.S. who know climate change is happening and who are determined to keep our commitments in Paris," Mr. Kerry said, drawing audience cheers.
Other government officials speaking at the U.N. conference declined to answer questions directly about the ramifications if Mr. Trump were to pull the U.S. out of the global climate negotiations.

Full text:   Global oil demand won't stop increasing before 2040 despite pledges made at the Paris climate-change summit last year to cap greenhouse-gas emissions, the head of the International Energy Agency said.
IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol's comments have added to a debate over when oil consumption, which has risen steadily for decades, will begin a sustained decline, a change known as peak demand.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry caused a stir this month when he said the company believes demand for oil could stop increasing within the next two decades and as soon as five years.
Mr. Birol said demand will keep rising for longer because there are scant alternatives to oil for road freight, aviation and petrochemicals, despite increasing investment in renewable energy.
Even efficiency gains in gas engines and an increase in the number of electric vehicles on the road won't be enough to halt a rise in oil demand, he said.
"The era of fossil fuels appears to be far from being over," Mr. Birol said.
Mr. Birol's remarks were made as the IEA publishes its annual report, forecasting global energy supply and demand to 2040.
Oil companies have started to look at a future in which consumer demand for their core product could stop expanding due to climate policies and efficiency gains.
"We've long been of the opinion that demand will peak before supply," Mr. Henry of Shell told analysts this month. "And that peak may be somewhere between five and 15 years hence, and it will be driven by efficiency and substitution."
Oil demand could peak by 2020 if a more stringent approach on climate change is taken, the IEA said.

Abstract: California has effectively become a one-party state in recent years, amid a surge in Latinos and other minorities who typically vote Democrat, political observers say. Since the 2000 presidential election, California's voter-registration roles have jumped 24%, or 3.7 million -- led by Latinos and Asians, according to estimates by the San Francisco-based Field Poll.

Full text:   As most of the country turned red Tuesday, Southern California's cradle of conservatism went blue. Orange County voted for Hillary Clinton, the first time voters there supported a Democratic presidential candidate since they helped elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936.
The historic flip is a powerful signal of California's new rebel status. The nation's most populous state, which has been in virtual lockstep with policies of the Obama White House, now stands as the country's political outlier.
Mrs. Clinton won 62% of the California vote, according to an Associated Press tally.
"We woke up feeling like strangers in a foreign land," said a statement from California Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Leon and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon -- both Latinos. They pledged to preserve the state's liberal policies. "We will lead the resistance to any effort that would shred our social fabric or our Constitution."
Kamala Harris, the state's attorney general and its newly elected Democratic U.S. Senator, promised immigrants she would protect them by fighting Republican President-elect Donald Trump's proposals to build a wall on the border with Mexico and deport the undocumented.
California has adopted some of the most liberal policies for undocumented immigrants, allowing them to obtain driver's licenses and for children and teens to access state-funded health care.
Under Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, California has gone further than most states in implementing the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Trump has pledged to repeal the law, but said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal he would consider preserving at least two provisions.
Mr. Brown has positioned himself as a climate-change activist; Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax and is likely to undo President Barack Obama's energy and environmental agenda.
"In California, we will do our part to find common ground whenever possible," Mr. Brown said. "But as Californians, we will also stay true to our basic principles. We will protect the precious rights of our people and continue to confront the existential threat of our time -- devastating climate change."
Mr. Brown joked months ago that "we'd have to build a wall around California" if Mr. Trump became president. Some Californians now see the state as so politically detachedthat a previously obscure proposal to place a secession measure on the ballot began trending on Twitter, under the hashtag GBP Calexit.
California has effectively become a one-party state in recent years, amid a surge in Latinos and other minorities who typically vote Democrat, political observers say.
Since the 2000 presidential election, California's voter-registration roles have jumped 24%, or 3.7 million -- led by Latinos and Asians, according to estimates by the San Francisco-based Field Poll.
Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Trump in Orange County by 5 percentage points and the president-elect may have helped the Democratic cause there, party leaders said. Fred Whitaker, chairman of the Orange County Republican Party, noted his party performed well in some local races.
Ling Ling Chang, a Republican running for a state Senate seat partly in Orange County, leadher Democratic opponent in a preliminary vote count. If Ms. Chang wins, it would prevent the Democrats from having a two-thirds majority in the state Legislature, which would give them the power to raise taxes without GOP votes.
Henry Vandermeir, chairman of the Orange County Democratic Party, said Democratic voter registration has been increasing steadily in recent years and Republican registration has been falling as the county's Latino population has grown. The most recent registration numbers from the California secretary of state show 34% of registered to vote in Orange County as Democrats, compared with 37.8% for Republicans. Statewide, 45% are Democrats; 26% are Republicans.

Full text:   Executives world-wide encountered a political and economic landscape radically changed by Donald Trump's surprise election that reverberated through the energy, health-care and manufacturing sectors.
U.S. businesses braced for revamped trade pacts and a potential crackdown on overseas operations, coupled with the promise of lower taxes, lighter regulation and higher infrastructure spending at home. Executives in Asia and Europe said they were hopeful their close ties with the U.S. economy would endure the political upheaval and heated campaign rhetoric.
"This election is the latest step in a longer-term, global trend that we have been adjusting to for a while -- one that's marked by political volatility and populism," Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric Co., wrote in a message to his employees.
For the energy industry, Mr. Trump's victory fanned expectations that he would clear the path for new pipelines, end U.S. participation in global climate change pacts and undo environmental regulations to boost American coal mining.
Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., said Mr. Trump would perk up the country's stagnant drilling boom by making it easier to build pipelines that unlock areas rich in oil and gas. "His message about creating jobs is why he broke the blue wall" and attracted votes from Democrats in some states, Mr. Sheffield said.
Continental Resources Inc. chief Harold Hamm, Mr. Trump's chief adviser on energy issues, said subsidies for renewable energy like solar and wind, and credits for electric cars, should be eliminated. "None of it should be subsidized, none of it," Mr. Hamm said Wednesday. "If it makes it in the market, fine."
Still, some rooftop solar executives voiced optimism, saying green power enjoys support from a bipartisan majority of consumers. "We do not see this election as changing its course," said Ed Fenster, chairman and co-founder of San Francisco-based Sunrun Inc.
Mr. Trump's victory also sent waves through the U.S. health-care industry, providing relief to drugmakers worried about the specter of government price limits but fanning fears for hospital operators and some health insurers that the Medicaid expansion in President Barack Obama's health law could get rolled back.
That provision had brought those companies more paying customers.
Mr. Trump has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, though many analysts think it is unlikely all of the health law's effects would be undone. Mr. Trump also took aim at high drug prices during his campaign, hinting at measures such as re-importation of drugs and giving Medicare powers to negotiate drug prices to limit price rises.
"Health-care reform is in place, it's going to be modified, it's going to move forward," said J. Mario Molina, the CEO of Molina HealthCare Inc., a large insurer of Medicaid patients. "We're going to see Obamacare 2.0, maybe they will call it Trumpcare, or Ryancare" after House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.). He suggested that Medicaid may extend under the new administration and the law's exchanges might also survive -- perhaps with reduced subsidies and more flexibility for insurers.
Despite the election outcome, the industry still has to reckon with "the very real concerns the public has" about drug prices and health-care affordability, said Ron Cohen, CEO of drugmaker Acorda Therapeutics Inc. "Those issues have not changed substantively just because we have a new administration," he said.
Mr. Trump has promised to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure projects, a position that was applauded by Caterpillar Inc.
The President-elect has pledged to cut corporate tax rates and boost infrastructure spending, but has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact to lower or eliminate tariffs between the U.S. and 11 other countries including Japan and Vietnam. He has also been critical of China, the biggest U.S. trading partner.
In an open letter Wednesday to Mr. Trump, a group of CEOs including the leaders of Boeing Co., Procter & Gamble Co. and United Technologies Corp. expressed an "urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions."
Manufacturers are eager to work with the Trump administration on boosting infrastructure-spending and easing regulatory and tax burdens, said Jay Timmons, CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.
But Mr. Timmons acknowledged the industry was at odds with Mr. Trump's trade rhetoric, and said the manufacturing group would need to mount a better public case highlighting how open markets can increase U.S. exports. "We just have to do a better job at communicating that, and frankly we haven't done so."

Full text:   On energy and environment issues, President-elect Donald Trump appears likely to spend the next four years working to unravel the expansive agenda President Barack Obama has cultivated.
Most of the action out of the gate, and potentially for a long time, could involve rolling back regulations.
Mr. Trump has said he would withdraw Mr. Obama's climate rule cutting power-plant carbon emissions, which is already facing a legal challenge that is almost certain to reach the Supreme Court. A federal appeals court decision on that regulation is expected in coming months, and a Trump administration could take the opportunity to opt out of defending the rule.
Other regulations Mr. Trump's administration will likely reconsider include two that have been blocked for now by federal courts: an Interior Department rule setting standards for hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas wells on public lands; and an Environmental Protection Agency provision bringing more small waterways and wetlands under federal protection.
Undoing regulations can be a lengthy endeavor and is often easier said than done. But a Trump administration could take a series of steps that collectively blunt the regulations, like starting a formal process to withdraw them or relaxing the compliance requirements.
Proactively, Mr. Trump has said he would revitalize the coal industry, but even coal executives have said market forces, namely cheap natural gas, make it hard for a president to help the coal industry in any substantial way.
The president-elect has also said he would unlock vast reserves of oil and natural gas -- although doing so risks undercutting his promise to help the coal industry.
Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax, and he has said he would review a 2009 scientific finding issued by the Obama administration that provides the legal underpinning for the departing president's regulatory approach to climate change.
Such a move would surely be challenged in court and likely lose, but the mere act of reviewing the finding could cast a cloud of political uncertainty over the science of climate change, which nearly all scientists agree is caused at least partly by humans' burning of fossil fuels.
Mr. Trump has also vowed to back out of a global deal addressing climate change and cut off U.S. aid to the $100 billion global climate fund to help poorer nations. He couldn't cancel the deal unilaterally, but could begin the process of withdrawing the U.S.
Or he could establish a requirement that the Senate ratify the deal, which it would be unlikely to do.

Full text:   LONDON -- Ten of the world's biggest oil companies plan to invest an average of $100 million annually over the next 10 years in low-carbon technologies, the companies said Friday.
The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, which includes state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC, said its investments will initially focus on carbon capture and storage technology and efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil-and-gas industry. Those efforts could significantly improve the prospects for the sector in a lower-emission world.
The pledged funding is the latest sign of the oil industry's efforts to respond to pressure from governments, activists and, increasingly, investors. The announcement came on the same day that a climate treaty negotiated in Paris last year by more than 200 countries to cap emissions and curb global warming came into force, potentially limiting the use of fossil fuels such as oil and gas.
Environmental groups said the oil companies' pledge of $1 billion over a decade wasn't enough and represented a tiny fraction of the group's annual spending on finding and producing fossil fuels. It is a pledge of $10 million a year for each company, said Jeremy Leggett, chairman of the Carbon Tracker Initiative.
"Given that the world has to mobilize trillions of dollars a year for clean energy within that time frame, if the Paris goal is to be realized, this is quite simply nowhere near good enough," he said.
The consortium said the joint fund is just the beginning of its efforts and comes on top of investments each company is making individually in alternative energy and lower-emission technology.
"We're doing a lot. We're doing billions when you combine all the other activities we've got, and this is just the start," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said.
The companies are increasingly looking toward a future in which demand for their core products -- oil and gas -- could begin to wane.
Total SA owns one of the largest solar companies in the world and earlier this year bought French battery maker Saft Group SA. Shell has created a "new energies" division to invest in renewables and low carbon power, and even Saudi Arabia is looking into developing solar power within the kingdom.
Shell Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry caused a stir earlier in the week when he said the company believes demand for oil could stop growing within the next two decades and as soon as five years. Known as "peak demand," the arrival of the day when consumer demand for oil stops growing has become a central worry for the fossil-fuel industry.
"We've long been of the opinion that demand will peak before supply," Mr. Henry told analysts Tuesday. "And that peak may be somewhere between five and 15 years hence, and it will driven by efficiency and substitution."
The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative was created in 2014 with United Nations backing to find ways the industry can support efforts to tackle climate change while continuing to produce its reserves.

Full text:   BERLIN -- The German government is postponing approval of a wide-ranging set of measures to combat climate change less than a week before a high-profile international meeting on combating global warming.
The decision, announced Wednesday, marks the latest embarrassment for a country that once pioneered the fight against global warming but has since seen its environmental credentials tarnished.
Germany's planned strategy -- a set of measures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions -- is intended to ensure that Europe's largest country meets its pledge at the United Nations' climate summit in Paris a year ago. Berlin had hoped to have the blueprint ready for the U.N. climate summit in Marrakesh, Morocco, next week, but it has become bogged down in bickering between the parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's left-right coalition in Berlin.
While the postponement won't have an immediate impact on the implementation of the 190-country Paris deal, experts said a weak showing from Germany at the Marrakesh meeting could have a corrosive effect. Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks told a group of regional newspapers Wednesday that the plan wouldn't be ready until December.
"Germany has long been one of the climate leaders within the European Union and also internationally," said Robert Falkner, an associate at the London School of Economics and Political Science's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. "When it comes to Morocco . . . countries will be looking at how they're developing," he said.
The fight against climate change has long been a priority of Ms. Merkel, herself a former environment minister and an early backer of an international agreement on emissions.

Full text:   Exxon Mobil Corp. warned that it may have to cut nearly 20% of its oil and gas reserves, and possibly write down some assets, capitulating to the slump in global energy prices after years of keeping the value of its massive holdings steady.
On Friday, Exxon disclosed that some 4.6 billion barrels in its reserves, primarily in Canada, may be too expensive to tap. While the company isn't yet writing down the value of those assets, for accounting purposes, it is acknowledging how low energy prices may impact the company for years to come.
Analysts and investors have noted that Exxon has been an outlier among energy producers in its decision to keep its reserve values steady, while competitors have taken billions of dollars in write-downs. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is examining the firm's accounting for its reserves, as well as its past knowledge of the impact of climate change on its business. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a similar inquiry.
In an investor call on Friday, Exxon declined to discuss potential reserve write-offs or accounting write-downs in detail beyond its statement. The SEC declined to comment.
"Exxon has long been the best at what they do, but these external constraints are putting them more in line with everyone else, forcing them to the level of their competitors," said Sean Heinroth, a principal in the energy practice at management consultancy A.T. Kearney.
Exxon is facing near- and long-term threats as it seeks to exploit the full value of a vast oil and gas portfolio that stretches from Texas to the Caspian Sea, and deliver the handsome dividends that its shareholders have come to expect since it was part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil.
Today, the company is suffering amid a two-year plunge in oil prices that has a barrel trading for around $50, a level Chief Executive Rex Tillerson believes may linger as U.S. shale producers ramp up at the first uptick in prices, prolonging the current glut and putting a ceiling on any price upswing.
Mr. Tillerson last year told a trade publication that the company avoids write-downs because it ratchets up pressure on managers to make projects work.
Earlier this year, Exxon lost the triple-A bond rating it had held from Standard & Poor's Rating Services since 1930, a standing of creditworthiness shared with just two other companies, Microsoft Corp. and Johnson & Johnson. Last year, it failed to find enough new oil and gas to replace what it produced for the first time in 20 years. Its profits in the last 12 months are the lowest since 1999, before it merged with Mobil Corp.
Exxon is alone among major oil companies in not having written down the value of its future wells as prices fell. It has said it follows conservative practices in booking reserves. It now plans to examine its assets to test, under rules governed by accounting standards, whether they are worth less than carried on its books. The company said the 20% reserves reductions, which are governed separately by SEC rules, may be necessary based on the average 2016 price by the end of the year, though higher prices in November and December could mitigate the extent of the decline.
Though Exxon didn't mention climate change or regulators in its disclosure, most of the assets it said may not be economic are among the most scrutinized by climate-change activists: Canada's oil sands.
Since 1999, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in Alberta's oil sands, which has the third largest oil reserves behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, says the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
Nine of the world's top oil companies, including Exxon, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, have been counting on wringing more Canadian crude from the ground in the coming decades. Combined, Canadian crude accounts for 23% of the firms' proven reserves, according to data from investment bank Peters & Co. -- up from only 5% in 2006.
The potential loss of reserves has broad ramifications for Canada, which depends on the development of its crude stores to support its economy, but like other western countries has been moving to strengthen regulations to address climate change. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this month unveiled a national carbon-pricing proposal, sparking an immediate clash between the national government and the province of Alberta.
The Liberal government's proposal to charge a price for carbon emissions compounds the headwinds energy companies already face if they want to mine Canada's oil sands for decades to come.
Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director for Energy and Sustainability at University of California, Davis, said Exxon's warning signals that it doesn't believe oil prices will rise significantly in the near future.
"If lots of companies have to do write downs on their Canadian reserves, it sends a gloomy message about the oil sands," she said.
Longer term, Exxon faces headwinds from regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, measures that are widely expected to fall most heavily on its industry.
Exxon's other major obstacle: U.S. competition. Advanced shale drilling techniques have unleashed a new wave of American oil into world markets. Those drilling and fracking techniques have made smaller American companies the industry's new "swing producers," or those most able to ramp up output quickly.

Full text:   Bjorn Lomborg's "About Those Non-Disappearing Pacific Islands" (op-ed, Oct. 14) claims my low-lying island nation is raising a false alarm on climate change to detract from dealing with some serious governance challenges.
Climate change is an unquestionable fact and duly acknowledged by every world leader. I am proud that my nation worked closely, with many others, to achieve the U.N.'s Paris Agreement on climate. More work is needed in the future to stave off the worst of global impacts.
The article omits a key conclusion of the cited scientific study -- that low-lying atolls are always dynamic coastal environments, but also equally true that climate-driven impacts, including sea-level rise, are very much a reality.
Mr. Lomborg attributes a claim to me that I have never made -- that climate change is the primary cause of Marshallese migration to the U.S. Our people are leaving largely because we are struggling to provide adequate employment and basic social services. Another reason why some of our people (Enewetak and Bikini people in particular) are migrating to the U.S. is because for them there is no choice: Either live on an island or atoll with radiologic contaminants from nuclear testing or migrate. However, the specter of climate-driven threats only adds to what is already a difficult future.
Mr. Lomborg might have asked why, despite decades of heavy assistance from the U.S. government, we are nowhere closer to achieving our most basic development aspirations. Nor does he acknowledge a primary basis for this agreement with the U.S.: the 67 large-scale nuclear-weapons tests undertaken by the U.S. which still have lasting impacts in our local communities, some of whose people remain "nuclear nomads."

Full text:   Corrections & Amplifications
Honeywell International Inc. said executive Patrick Hogan was referring to cumulative sales when he told investors in June that its Solstice line of refrigerants, aerosols and solvents would be "a $1 billion business in the next year." His remarks, reported in a Business & Tech article Monday about new rules to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, didn't indicate he was referring to cumulative sales.
(WSJ Oct. 19, 2016)
A global pact to limit planet-warming emissions is likely to force manufacturers of air conditioners and refrigerators to consider passing the additional cost of alternative coolants to consumers.
Global envoys agreed on Saturday to phase out hydrofluorocarbons from cooling appliances beginning in 2019. Meeting in Rwanda, major emitters including the U.S., China and India agreed to aim for an 80% reduction in their use by 2045.
Alternative coolants exist to power window-unit air conditioners, commercial chillers and household refrigerators, but many are unapproved for use in the U.S. Some are flammable. Manufacturers will have to convince regulators the new compounds are safe before retooling production.
"It's not going to be easy, but we're committed to doing it," said Stephen Yurek, chief executive of the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group.
Many companies anticipated that so-called HFCs would eventually be banned. They have collectively spent billions of dollars researching alternatives, Mr. Yurek said, adding that his group supported a global framework for coolant regulations.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently set deadlines to phase out HFCs in new appliances such as refrigerators by 2021 and in chillers by 2024. Industry groups have said those targets would hurt business.
"Our members are rushing right now to make sure that the alternative refrigerants are going to work, going to be safe," said Joe McGuire, chief executive of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers.
He said manufacturers want more time to harmonize guidelines related to refrigerants as well as new expected rules mandating greater energy efficiency. Meeting the 2021 refrigerator deadline, instead of the 2024 date the industry proposed, could collectively cost manufacturers an additional $230 million, he added.
An EPA spokesman said: "While there will be some costs associated with transitioning to alternatives, we do not anticipate that this will pose a significant burden on industry -- particularly given the many commitments they have already made to move to climate-friendly alternatives."
Kevin Fay, executive director of the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, an industry group that represents chemical companies and appliance makers, said retooling a chemical plant for a new coolant could cost more than $200 million. But consumer prices for appliances might eventually rise only as much as about 2%, as has been the case in previous coolant phaseouts, he said.
The phaseout could be a boon for makers of less-polluting HFC alternatives that are already on the market.
Honeywell International Inc. over the past few years has ramped up production of refrigerants that emit less greenhouse gas than HFCs.
A vice president from the company's Performance Materials & Technologies unit, Patrick Hogan, told investors at a conference in June that its "Solstice" line of refrigerants, aerosols and solvents would be "a $1 billion business in the next year."
Honeywell said it was designing as many offerings as possible in the Solstice line as "drop-ins," meaning they can be used by appliance and vehicle manufacturers with minimal design changes, which could help offset the higher cost of the new coolants. Some nine million vehicles are equipped with air conditioners using Honeywell's post-HFC refrigerant, the company said in June, and that number should double by the end of this year.
Honeywell has $3.4 billion in long-term agreements to supply Solstice chemicals to major car companies and appliance makers like Whirlpool Corp., Haier Electronics Group Co. and Midea Group Co. The company says government action to limit greenhouse-gas emissions in China and India could drive further growth in sales of these products.
Ingersoll-Rand PLC, the maker of Trane air-conditioning equipment, said it was testing a climate-friendly refrigerant alternative for small air conditioning systems that would require no additional engineering to use in existing systems.
Johnson Controls International PLC recently introduced two building-cooling systems that use an alternative coolant made by Chemours Co., a Delaware company that was spun off from DuPont Co. last year. Laura Wand, Johnson Controls vice president of global chillers, said the coolant was chosen because it is nonflammable and significantly less harmful to the environment than other refrigerants.
Fomo Products, an Ohio manufacturer of spray-on insulation, said last year it intended to use more hydrofluoroolefin, a less-potent greenhouse gas than what HFCs emit. Fomo Products was acquired by Innovative Chemical Products Group in April.
Doug Mattscheck, chief executive of Innovative Chemical Products, said the new gas would have a material impact on insulation pricing. He wrote in an email that "the input materials for the HFO formulations are currently more expensive and the manufacturing process is more challenging."

Full text:   From the Minneapolis suburbs, Cargill Inc. runs one of the biggest food empires the world has ever seen, spanning the supply chain from farm to table -- shipping fertilizer to farmers, buying the crops that are grown, processing grain into feed for livestock and poultry, and producing burgers and nuggets for the world's biggest restaurant chains and retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and McDonald's Corp.
As consumer tastes shift, Cargill is striving to make its immense size an advantage rather than a hindrance. It has revamped its corporate structure and portfolio of businesses as it responds to consumer concerns in developed countries about food ingredients and animal welfare, while investing to provide more Western-style diets to developing parts of the world.
We spoke with Chief Executive David MacLennan about growing demand for foods produced without genetically engineered crops, further investments needed in food-shipping infrastructure, and how Cargill can respond to climate change. Edited excerpts of the discussion follow.
WSJ: In developed countries like the U.S., more people are seeking food produced with less intervention, from organic produce to cage-free eggs, challenging companies like Cargill to respond. But in developing parts of the world, many people are just starting to add meat to their diets and are looking for cheap, safe food. How does Cargill succeed on both ends of this spectrum?
MR. MACLENNAN: When incomes rise to several thousand dollars, people change their diets from a carbohydrate-based diet to one that's more protein-based. In places like North America, where as a consumer you have plenty of protein, plenty of choices, you have people who want to know, "What's in my food, who made it, who supplies them?"
For us, that's where you have to be agile. Non-GMO, is that here to stay? Talking to an egg farmer, McDonald's is going to cage-free eggs -- his dilemma is, is that permanent? "I have to invest, do I redo my barn? But if in 2020 nobody cares anymore, am I going to be able to make my return?" Going back to the supply chain, that is the challenge -- different parts of the world have different needs, and there are different trends, and how can we meet those needs doing business in 70 different countries?
WSJ: How do you know what's the right thing to do?
MR. MACLENNAN: More people are making their food consumption choices based on their value system. So it's part of, "I want to feel healthy or identify with the food that I eat." The fact is, I think the food industry could have handled the non-GMO debate in a more constructive way.
If you think back a few years, the strategy was, let's fight it at the ballot box. Washington state, California, Colorado, they had ballot initiatives on GMO labeling. The message [of those initiatives was], people want to know. But the idea [of the food companies] was, let's fight it at the ballot box, and the science shows that GMOs are not bad for you. But people who don't want GMOs don't trust the science.
There's a growing group of people who don't want GMO ingredients. So let's develop a supply chain for that, rather than say, "You're wrong if you don't want GMOs."
If you think about consumption choices, health care and food are incredibly intimate and personal choices. And people need to and want to trust products that are providing them with those choices and ingredients. Our mind-set is we're going to empathize and understand the consumer on what they want in their food.
WSJ: Big harvests have pressured farmers' incomes, and some farmers in places like South America have struggled to get financing. What about the farming model may need to change to ensure people can stay in business?
MR. MACLENNAN: Farmers are technologists. Many, many farmers have an iPad in their harvester or in their combine, and they're using precision agriculture. And we actually do a lot of this in terms of sustainability and which parts of their farm have the most nutritious soil, the most moisture, where I need to plant the seeds. They use GMOs as a tool for increased productivity.
And fewer people are going into farming. The world needs farmers. There's the farm industry and the food industry. One of our questions is, how do we make it exciting? Feeding the world is exciting, it's a noble purpose, but how do we communicate that to a new generation, where people are interested in tech, or in consulting?
You have to make it exciting, to come work at a food company. Technology and modern farm techniques have helped take some pressure off, because yields have come up over time, but you still need people to go into farming.
WSJ: Right now farmers are bringing in what could be another record corn and soybean harvest in the U.S., and supplies of poultry, pork and beef are swelling. As grain bins fill around the world, is food security meaningfully improving as a result?
MR. MACLENNAN: Not at the rate that it needs to. The production areas -- North America, South America, the Black Sea, where food is grown -- it's really unbelievable. You are looking at a fourth successive year of bumper crops, great growing weather and significant supplies. It's keeping the price of food down. That's a good thing. At the same time, we -- food and farming supply-chain companies -- need to do a better job of how do we get it to where it's needed.
Infrastructure in Brazil for the agricultural economy is not yet where it needs to be. That's one of the areas that needs investment. Ports, river terminals. It's great if Brazilian farmers can grow corn and beans and get it to China to feed that country or get it to the Middle East. But if you don't have the infrastructure, the barges and ports to get it out, it doesn't do any good.
WSJ: How do you see climate change affecting food production and what you're doing at Cargill?
MR. MACLENNAN: Climate change is here, and it's going to change how and where food is grown. Today, the U.S. corn belt is in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana. In 50 years, it may be in Hudson Bay, Canada.
What does that mean for supply-chain companies and food production, and trying to get in front of it? How farmers grow the food, where they grow it, the need for analytical tools to help them respond to periods of great weather or horrible weather -- that's where Cargill can play a role.
WSJ: Free trade has been one of Cargill's guiding principles since the company started 151 years ago. How much is at stake in the U.S. election?
MR. MACLENNAN: It's one of the critical issues.
We have worked diligently with Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, who's been a big supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack -- the administration's been great. I don't know where this election will go, but I hope that when a new administration is in place there is a more open issue around TPP. I think it would be tragic if we go backward relative to trade, and I think the world needs it.

Full text:   MIAMI -- Former Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday returned to the campaign trail in Florida, where his 537-vote loss cost him the White House in 2000, presenting himself as "exhibit A" on the importance of voting.
"Please take it from me: Every single vote counts," he told 1,600 people at a rally here with Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.
Mr. Gore reminded younger people in the audience that his loss to Republican George W. Bush was "very close" -- so close that many Democrats believe the outcome would have been different if the Supreme Court hadn't halted a recount of ballots.
As Mr. Gore spoke of the contest, the audience began chanting, "You won! You won!"
Mr. Gore said he didn't want the crowd to have to renew the chant for Mrs. Clinton if she were to face a similar result. Mr. Gore won the national popular vote, but Mr. Bush won the Electoral College.
It went unmentioned on Tuesday, but some Democrats still blame consumer activist Ralph Nader for helping to elect Mr. Bush by pulling votes that might have otherwise gone to Mr. Gore. One concern for Mrs. Clinton: Third-party candidates could gain the support of young voters whom she needs to win.
The pair also focused on Mr. Gore's signature issue of battling climate change, an important topic for many young voters. The former vice president called Mrs. Clinton the superior choice to handle the issue, saying she would make it "a top national priority," while opponent Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, would "take us toward a climate catastrophe."
Mrs. Clinton pointed to Hurricane Matthew last week, which she said was made fiercer by a warmed ocean, with a storm surge more destructive because sea levels have risen.
The event at Miami Dade College also marked a thawing of what at times has been a chilly relationship between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gore. As first lady and vice president, they competed for influence in Bill Clinton's White House.
Angry over President Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Mr. Gore didn't run on the president's legacy in 2000. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, stuck with her husband in her run for the Senate that year, competing with Mr. Gore for money and attention. She was elected to the Senate, which put her on her current path.
Mr. Gore didn't endorse Mrs. Clinton's 2008 run for president, and he stayed out of the 2016 primary. He announced his support for Mrs. Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention and didn't attend the gathering.
Mr. Gore's speech focused on their shared policy agenda, without observations from their years at the White House.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A climate treaty negotiated by more than 200 countries to cap emissions and curb the global rise in temperatures will go into force in November after the United Nations announced Wednesday the pact had reached the threshold necessary to formally take effect.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the so-called Paris Agreement would enter into force on Nov. 4.
The agreement aims to keep average global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels through individualized national limits on greenhouse gas emissions.
The deal doesn't legally require countries to curb emissions or take other steps on climate change -- in the U.S. that would have likely required ratification by the Senate, which President Barack Obama was unlikely to get -- but it does require countries to release their targets and report emissions.
Seventy-three of 197 parties to the convention have ratified, including the U.S. and China, the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters. This week, a number of European countries voted to join the pact, and the European Union voted to move forward as well.
Russia, Japan and Australia are among the countries that haven't.
Mr. Obama said Wednesday the world had arrived at a "historic moment."
"If we follow through on the commitments that this Paris agreement embodies, history may well judge it as a turning point for our planet," he said in the White House's Rose Garden.

Full text:   Education Ruling Offends
Disabled, Violates Law
I have followed closely the CCJEF v. Rell case in Connecticut, and I was shocked that its implications for people with disabilities weren't mentioned in your profile of Judge Thomas Moukawsher ("A Bench Player Takes a Star Turn," Sept. 24). Judge Moukawsher's decision is not only offensive to people with disabilities, but a clear violation of federal law. If we accepted the view of Judge Moukawsher on treatment of children with severe disabilities, imagine how many would enter adulthood with no chance of contributing to society, whether through employment or otherwise. I am reminded of meeting a young man in Louisiana recently, Lamar White Jr., who has cerebral palsy and a law degree. What happens to a guy like that if along the way someone mistakenly concluded education didn't serve him?
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act's strength isn't based on "urban legends," as the opinion stated, but instead upon decades of work to understand how to maximize the value of education for special-needs children and to overcome the erroneous stigma that severely disabled children aren't worth educating.
Upon review, the appellate courts should reject the judge's approach to eliminate education spending on services to disabled children because "they have no substantial connection to education" as inconsistent with federal law and unworthy of the standards we set for a decent society.

Don't Blame Manning
For First Interception
It is clear watching the film of the Sept. 25 game that on the first interception the Giants' tight end stopped his route. Had he continued running he would have had position to make the catch. Eli Manning always takes responsibility for the errors of others ("Key Play: Washington Cuts to the Pick," Sept. 28).

Park Group Raps 'Fringe'
Critics of Museum Plan
Friends of Roosevelt Park is a 25-year-old nonprofit that has pumped $1 million into the 10-acre park at the American Museum of Natural History. We have a written MOU with the Parks Department and museum dating to 2002. The "rift" you describe principally comprises several vociferous, small, fringe groups not representative of our West Side neighborhood ("Museum Expansion Causes Rift," Sept. 26). The Defenders of Roosevelt Park mounted an effective protest, which reduced the museum footprint in the park to one-quarter acre from a half-acre. The other groups seem bent on their 10 seconds of fame in the media, nothing more.
Furthermore, the Rose Space Center, opened in 2000, includes the one-acre rooftop Arthur Ross Terrace, including trees, a lawn and water features ideal for young children. The museum, not the Parks Department, pays for its maintenance. It replaced an eyesore of an asphalt parking lot. The museum, far from being a horticultural Cookie Monster, has added one acre to Roosevelt Park, and it proposes to take a quarter of an acre, for a net gain of three-quarters of an acre. The new building comprises classrooms focused on sustainability, climate change and global warming, all authorized by an 1876 state law allowing the museum to build -- and expand -- in this park.

Public Funds Shouldn't Go
Toward Museum Expansion
Given the homelessness and food insecurity affecting so many of our neighbors, the use of millions of taxpayer dollars to fund the American Museum of Natural History's proposed expansion is appalling.
To focus on the uncertain preservation of two trees is a diversion. Rather, think about the seven gorgeous old trees that will come down, and the mature gardens and grassland that will be destroyed. Once these are lost, they are lost forever.

Abstract: By embedding the cost of carbon dioxide emissions in the price consumers and businesses pay for energy, such a tax automatically encourages conservation and makes renewable energy more appealing, without regulations and subsidies that distort investment and undercut growth. Because the revenue is used to cut other taxes, it doesn't crimp incomes or undermine business competitiveness.

Full text:   Climate change landed in a Washington, D.C., court this week as Republican governors and business groups sued to block President Barack Obama's sweeping regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.
The lawsuit is only the latest example of how polarized politics have made it so difficult to reconcile two divergent priorities: climate change and economic growth.
Across the country, however, voters are being offered a plan that does just that.
In November, Washington state will vote on the country's first revenue-neutral carbon tax. By embedding the cost of carbon dioxide emissions in the price consumers and businesses pay for energy, such a tax automatically encourages conservation and makes renewable energy more appealing, without regulations and subsidies that distort investment and undercut growth. Because the revenue is used to cut other taxes, it doesn't crimp incomes or undermine business competitiveness.
In the environmentally conscientious state, Initiative 732, as the ballot measure is known, ought to be a slam-dunk. It isn't -- a poll shows voters roughly split. The reasons are a window into why climate policy is so polarizing.
The resistance comes not just from the usual opponents on the right, but even more strikingly from the left. The reason: Many environmentalists see climate change as an opportunity to remake the economic order. They want to use carbon taxes to fund renewable energy and green technology and bolster the incomes of workers and communities they say are most hurt by climate change.
Whatever the merits of these goals, the effect is to equate climate policy with bigger government, which makes it harder to achieve broad-based support.
Washington state's proposed levy is the brainchild of economist Yoram Bauman, who previously taught economics at the University of Washington. He now makes his living doing stand-up comedy about economics.
Democratic Governor Jay Inslee had proposed a cap-and-trade plan modeled on California's, but couldn't get it passed.
So Mr. Bauman's group, Carbon Washington, put forth I-732 as an alternative. It would impose a $15 tax per ton of carbon dioxide in the first year, rising to $25 in the second, and thereafter by 3.5% after inflation annually to $100 in current dollars.
The tax would add 25 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline and boost the average monthly electric bill by about $8. All the revenue -- roughly $2 billion a year -- would be returned to taxpayers via a one-percentage point cut in the state sales tax, elimination of a business tax, and a tax rebate of up to $1,500 a year to 460,000 low-income workers.
I-732 is modeled on a similar levy introduced in British Columbia in 2008 that now stands at US$23 per metric ton. A study by Werner Antweiler and Sumeet Gulati at the University of British Columbia found the tax has curbed the average person's fuel consumption by 7% and boosted the average car's fuel efficiency by 4%.
Given all that, why don't more environmentalists support it? In part, internal politics: Some groups are miffed they didn't have more say in the design of I-732. Others think I-732 won't pass and their energy is better devoted to politically more viable initiatives. Having failed to pass cap-and-trade legislation, Mr. Inslee has, like Mr. Obama, since moved to cap some emissions via regulation.
But the main reason is that I-732 sends its revenue back to taxpayers, whereas environmentalists would like the revenue for other priorities. The Washington Environmental Council, which doesn't support I-732, says revenue from any climate initiative should be plowed into the "clean energy economy . . . infrastructure for clean, abundant water and healthy forests" and assistance for "the most vulnerable workers and communities."
Rather than compromise, other climate activists have sought to oust political opponents -- usually Republicans.
Their stance is shortsighted, for two reasons. While a carbon tax makes emissions caps and subsidies redundant, it can also complement them by nudging consumers in the same direction. Second, it risks turning climate change into a one-party issue.
Some environmentalists "have this dream the Republican Party is going to jump off the cliff, but the evidence is the Republican Party is going to stick around for a while," says Mr. Bauman.
It is precisely because a revenue-neutral carbon tax isn't weighed down by so many ancillary social goals that it stands the best chance of appealing to people across the political spectrum.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Defenders and detractors of President Barack Obama's centerpiece climate-change regulation faced critical questions from a federal court Tuesday in a lawsuit that will have a far-reaching impact on how the nation fuels its electricity.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard several hours of oral arguments, with a focus on the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch, and what constitutes a power plant source.
The Environmental Protection Agency issued the regulation, called the Clean Power Plan, last year, requiring a 32% reduction in power-plant carbon emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. The rules are the flagship policy of Mr. Obama's climate agenda and represents the core of his administration's commitment to a United Nations agreement in Paris last year to address climate change.
The judges said they recognized the Obama administration was acting on climate change because Congress has opted not to and in response to a Supreme Court decision almost a decade ago giving the EPA legal authority to regulate carbon emissions. But they raised questions about whether the scope of the rules go further than lawmakers intended.
Addressing climate change through policy is "laudable," said Judge Brett Kavanaugh, adding, "The Earth is warming. Humans are contributing. I understand the frustration with Congress."
But Judge Kavanaugh said Congress needs to clearly assign an agency the authority to address a major policy issue like climate change. It's not clear Congress has done so in this case, he said, despite the EPA's assertion that it is relying on part of the Clean Air Act. "Global warming is not a blank check," Judge Kavanaugh said.
The EPA regulation aims to push utilities to shift from coal plants to cleaner energy sources like natural gas, wind and solar.
The judges focused much of their questioning on whether the EPA had overstepped its legal authority by seeking to broadly compel this shift away from coal. The states and companies suing the EPA argue the agency doesn't have the authority to regulate anything outside of a power plant itself.
Judge Patricia Millett expressed concern that the administration was in effect requiring power plants to subsidize companies competing with them for electricity demand. "That seems to be quite different" from traditional regulation, Judge Millett said.
The judges also debated an apparent legislative discrepancy nearly 30 years old that could raise questions about whether the EPA has the legal authority to regulate carbon emissions from power plants in the first place.
"I think the language is very convoluted at best," Judge Kavanaugh said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's power-plant emissions rule faces a courtroom showdown this week, and the outcome could have big repercussions for Washington's ability to meet its promises under a landmark climate-change accord.
The Environmental Protection Agency issued the regulations a little more than a year ago, requiring a 32% reduction in power-plant carbon emissions by 2030.
Industry associations and a group of mostly Republican-led states filed over three dozen lawsuits challenging the rules while the GOP has made regulatory relief an issue in the presidential campaign.
It is the latest clash between the White House and conservatives who say President Barack Obama has exceeded his authority on a range of issues, including immigration and health care.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will hear several hours of oral argument Tuesday on the power-plant regulations.
A conservative Supreme Court majority intervened in February to stay the EPA rules while the case proceeds, putting the measures on pause. That 5-4 order came four days before Justice Antonin Scalia died, creating uncertainty about the court's direction.
In another unusual development, the appeals court is skipping its usual routine of using a three-judge panel to hear the case, opting instead for a roster of 10 judges, a sign of the case's gravity.
"It's a very pivotal issue on several levels," said Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director of energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis. "On one level, it's a political issue over the power of the executive branch, and on another, it's pivotal for different stakeholders in the clean tech and coal industries."
The EPA rules, called the Clean Power Plan, aim to push utilities to shift from coal plants to cleaner energy sources like natural gas, wind and solar. It gives states flexibility on how to reduce power-plant emissions within their borders, but alternative energy is a necessary component because the emissions targets couldn't be met solely by making existing coal-fired plants more efficient.
Mr. Obama touted the regulations in the run-up to the United Nations climate talks in Paris last December, where about 200 countries agreed to undertake ambitious efforts to cut greenhouse emissions.
The challengers say the EPA is claiming sweeping new powers to transform the energy industry without congressional authorization. They note that the EPA issued the regulations under a rarely used section of the Clean Air Act, and criticize the agency's promotion of clean-energy generation instead of just regulating existing pollution sources.
"EPA's audacious assertion of authority. . .is more far-reaching than any previous effort by the agency," a group of utilities, trade associations and 26 states said in a legal brief.
The challengers also say the agency is illegally double-regulating power plants already subject to rules limiting emission of mercury and other toxins. And they say the EPA is interfering with states' right to regulate their own utilities.
The EPA says cutting power-plant emissions is crucial to abating climate change, and that it chose an attainable, cost-effective approach. The agency also says Supreme Court precedent supports its authority to regulate carbon pollution from power plants.
The court's decision will pave the way for a near-certain Supreme Court fight. Even a partial rebuke of the Clean Power Plan could make it impossible for the U.S. to accomplish what Mr. Obama pledged in the Paris deal, the capstone of his environmental legacy and an accord supporters see as critical to fighting climate change.

Full text:   Long-running efforts to curb the impact of commercial aviation on climate change face a crucial test this week when representatives from nearly 200 countries debate whether to set up the first global cap on carbon emissions from international flights.
Officials are gathering in Montreal for talks starting Tuesday aimed at tackling one of the major sources of carbon-dioxide emissions not covered by the Paris climate deal struck in December. The Paris accord excluded commercial flights since most of aviation's CO2 emissions are produced outside national borders.
Excluding aviation left "a gaping hole" to meeting the Paris target, said Lou Leonard, senior vice president for climate change at the World Wildlife Fund.
International aviation accounts for over 2% of global carbon emissions, Mr. Leonard said, making the industry equivalent to the seventh-biggest emitting country.
The meeting, which runs through Oct. 7, will see representatives of the 191 members of the United Nations' commercial flight regulator, the International Civil Aviation Organization, convene to address topics including safety and plane noise; CO2 emissions will top the agenda.
Under the deal on the table, airline emissions would effectively be capped in 2020, with carriers having to offset further growth. The ICAO estimates the cost of such a program to airlines in 2035 could range from $5.3 billion to as much as $23.9 billion, depending on the price of carbon. That compares with the $181 billion that airlines spent last year on fuel.

Full text:   PITTSBURGH -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump promised sweeping deregulation of natural-gas, oil and coal production as part of an "America-first energy" plan.
Speaking on Thursday to a conference of 1,500 gas-industry executives, managers and salespeople, Mr. Trump said he would lift restrictions on America's "untapped energy -- some $50 trillion in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves."
He promised to end "all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety."
Mr. Trump named an $850 million coal export terminal in Washington, a $3 billion Northwest gas pipeline and a $6.8 billion gas-export terminal as examples of the fossil-fuel projects that have been rejected by regulators or withdrawn by supporters since 2012. A recent tally found about $33 billion in projects have been derailed by regulations, grass-roots opposition and falling energy prices, a figure that Mr. Trump cited.
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has called for investment in renewable energy and steep reductions in U.S. carbon emissions as part of an effort to address global warming.
The development of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has stimulated gas drilling throughout the Marcellus and Utica shales, creating tens of thousands of jobs, and offering new business opportunities for suppliers. For example, U.S. Steel Corp. expanded its business making steel pipes and tubes used in gas drilling. But the shale-gas industry has suffered since 2014, when energy prices started declining.
Mrs. Clinton has said she supports fracking with appropriate regulations, as well as the right of local governments to restrict the practice.
Mr. Trump promised new prosperity in the gas industry via deregulation, which he said his friends in the business were more enthusiastic about than tax cuts. He said deregulation would lift gross domestic product by $100 billion a year and add 500,000 jobs annually in the next seven years.
Some conference delegates noted that on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has focused more on coal than on gas. In his speech Thursday, Mr. Trump also promised to "end the war on coal," including rescinding a coal-lease moratorium and conducting "a top-down review" of all coal regulations issued by the Obama administration. This year is the first in which gas will supply a larger percentage of U.S. electricity than coal.
The Obama administration has rejected Mr. Trump's and other Republicans' "war on coal" label, saying its job is to enforce environmental laws that protect the nation's air and water.
Environmentalists oppose Mr. Trump's agenda. Rhea Suh of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund called it "a wish list for big polluters" that would "ignore climate change, and allow damage to our air, land and water."
Delegates at the conference, which routinely invites a pro-business Republican as its keynote speaker, were supportive, but some expressed reservations about Mr. Trump.
"Hillary said she wants to ban fracking, and fracking is my livelihood, but some of the things Donald Trump says are horrible," said Rick Wasfy, a representative for a company which removes sand from gas wells after fracking.
Mr. Wasfy declared himself satisfied with the speech, especially Mr. Trump's focus on deregulation. That showed that "he knows what he's talking about," Mr. Wasfy said.

Full text:   The federal investigation of how Exxon Mobil Corp values assets in a world of increasing climate-change regulations elicited sharp reactions on Wednesday, with some investors seeing it as a tipping point in a campaign to get companies to disclose climate risks, and some oil industry leaders calling it a politically motivated attack.
But many agreed on one thing: It was a potentially transformative moment for U.S. companies, which now have to worry about regulators' scrutiny of future climate change impacts more seriously than before.
The probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is focused on how Exxon calculates the impact to its business from climate change, including what figures the company uses to evaluate the viability of future projects.
The SEC hasn't publicly disclosed it is investigating Exxon, but the probe was confirmed by an Exxon spokesman on Tuesday.
Defenders of Exxon saw the probe as an indication that the SEC has moved into partisan politics, taking up acause championed by some Democratic state attorneys general,who have led probes into the company's response to climate change.
"It seems like to me it's a witch hunt," Scott Sheffield, chief executive of oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co., said during an industry conference Wednesday.
Some investors and activists, meanwhile, cited what they saw as Exxon's insularity as a potential rationale for the SEC.
The company's pushback amid pressure from some shareholders on the issue is emblematic of the response of many U.S. oil and gas companies, a strategy that is likely to change in the face of new SEC scrutiny, said Anne Simpson, the investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System.
Exxon and the SEC declined to comment on Wednesday.

Full text:   UNITED NATIONS -- A global climate agreement moved closer toward taking effect by the end of the year, as 30 more nations ratified it at a special meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.
The deal, championed by the Obama administration and struck last year in Paris among 195 countries, sets out a global plan to take steps aimed at limiting climate change. But it can enter into force only once 55 countries representing 55% of the world's greenhouse-gas emissions -- widely thought to be the main cause for a steady rise in global temperatures -- have ratified it.
As of Wednesday, one of the two conditions -- the number of countries -- was met, as 60 countries have now ratified it, representing 47.7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. The world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitters -- the U.S. and China -- ratified the deal this month. An additional 13 countries committed to ratifying the deal by the end of 2016.
"I'm evermore confident that the Paris agreement will enter into force this year," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said during the event on Wednesday.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry thanked the "warriors for the planet" for taking action, noting that the months of July and August were "the hottest months ever recorded on the planet," and expressed hope that the Paris deal would come into force before the next U.N. meeting on climate change in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November.
If the deal goes into effect this year, the U.S. would be prevented from pulling out for four years, potentially binding the hands of the next president -- even if he or she was intent on reversing course. "I expect the U.S. to remain. The EU would not like a scenario similar to the Kyoto Protocol, when there was a withdrawal," the European Union's climate chief Miguel Arias Canete told The Wall Street Journal, in reference to the Bush administration's 2001 move to withdraw from the precursor to the Paris deal.
Mr. Canete said he was confident the EU would complete the ratification of the Paris agreement in October, with an agreement among the bloc's 28 environment ministers expected next week in Brussels.
As international talks on an emission-reducing deal for the aviation industry kick off next week in Montreal, Mr. Canete said that even if the final deal turned out to be less ambitious than EU's own aviation emission rules, the bloc would continue to implement its rules for its domestic flights.
Business leaders welcomed the prospect of the Paris deal coming into force. "With this clear direction of travel from political leaders, companies can now accelerate efforts to achieve a zero carbon future," said Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever PLC.

Full text:   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how Exxon Mobil Corp. values its assets in a world of increasing climate-change regulations, a probe that could have far-reaching consequences for the oil and gas industry.
The SEC sought information and documents in August from Exxon and the company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, according to people familiar with the matter. The federal agency has been receiving documents the company submitted as part of a continuing probe into similar issues begun last year by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, the people said.
The SEC's probe is homing in on how Exxon calculates the impact to its business from the world's mounting response to climate change, including what figures the company uses to account for the future costs of complying with regulations to curb greenhouse gases as it evaluates the economic viability of its projects.
The decision to step into an Exxon investigation and seek climate-related information represents a moment in the effort to take climate change more seriously in the financial community, said Andrew Logan, director of the oil and gas program at Ceres, a Boston-based advocacy organization that has pushed for more carbon-related disclosure from companies.
"It's a potential tipping point not just for Exxon, but for the industry as a whole," he said.
As part of its probe, the SEC is also examining Exxon's longstanding practice of not writing down the value of its oil and gas reserves when prices fall, people familiar with the matter said. Exxon is the only major U.S. producer that hasn't taken a write down or impairment since oil prices plunged two years ago. Peers including Chevron Corp. have lowered valuations by a collective $50 billion.
"The SEC is the appropriate entity to examine issues related to impairment, reserves and other communications important to investors," said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers. "We are fully complying with the SEC request for information and are confident our financial reporting meets all legal and accounting requirements."
A spokeswoman for PwC declined to comment. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said the attorney general wouldn't comment on the matter.
The SEC probe isn't believed to involve other energy companies, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Activists, members of Congress and former government officials have ratcheted up pressure on the SEC in the past year to do more to assess climate risks. Four congressional Democrats including U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu last year asked the SEC to investigate Exxon over its climate-related science and advocacy. Three former U.S. treasury secretaries wrote the SEC in July urging the agency to adopt industry-specific standards for disclosure in company filings.
A potential sticking point in the probe is what price Exxon uses to assess the "price of carbon" -- the cost of regulations such as a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system to push down emissions -- when evaluating certain future oil and gas prospects, the people said. The SEC is asking how Exxon's carbon price affects its balance sheet and the outlook for its future, the people said.
When such a theoretical price for carbon is low, more oil and gas wells would be commercially viable. Conversely, a high carbon price would make more of Exxon's assets look uneconomic to pull out of the ground in future years.
In 2014, Exxon determined that none of its assets are at risk of being rendered less valuable by impacts from the global response to climate change.
Exxon doesn't disclose the exact price it uses to determine the commercial viability of its projects -- outside of a general $20-$80 range for the future -- but many of its rivals, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC, do. Both Shell and BP say they use an internal price of roughly $40 a metric ton to decide whether to proceed with a project.
By contrast, Houston-based ConocoPhillips said it uses an internal carbon price range of between $6 and $51 a metric ton, depending on a project's location and annual projected emissions.
Exxon has ardently defended its record of climate research against critics, as well as its view that the use of fossil fuels will grow in coming decades, which corresponds to the predictions of major global energy forecasters.
Still, some investors such as the California Public Employees' Retirement System say Exxon and other energy companies should acknowledge the growing global response to climate change may mean that it will never be able to tap future wells that make up a great deal of its multibillion-dollar value.
Exxon also has defended its practice of not writing down the value of assets, saying that it is extremely conservative in booking the value of new fields and wells, which lowers its need to reduce the value of those assets if falling prices later affect the reserves' value.

Texas' Latest Gusher: Wind and Sun --- Lone Star state sees surge in renewable energy after markets deregulated

Author: Spindle, Bill; Smith, Rebecca

Abstract: The free market-oriented deregulation broke the grip of most monopoly utilities that controlled generation, transmission and retail sales of electricity and introduced competitive auctions for wholesale power. A recent poll conducted by the Texas Clean Energy Coalition, a nonpartisan group that supports the growth of gas as well renewable energy, found that despite strong distaste for federal environmental regulations aimed at reducing coal, 85% of Texans favored expanding renewables while 9% were opposed.\n

Full text:   SAN ANTONIO -- On a blustery February night, the Texas electricity market hit a milestone. Nearly half the power flowing onto the grid came from wind turbines, a level unimaginable a decade ago in a place better known for its long romance with fossil fuels.
The Lone Star state still embraces its oil and gas, leading a revolution in innovative "fracking" technology. Yet an equally startling energy bonanza here has gone almost unnoticed -- the rise of renewables.
Texas has added more wind-based generating capacity than any other state, with wind turbines accounting for 16% of electrical generating capacity as of April. Now Texas is anticipating a huge surge in solar power.
At a time when debate is raging between political parties over climate change, and critics charge that "green energy" is little more than a government creation, Texas has taken an approach that works within the state's free-market-based electricity system. State officials say wind and solar are almost certain to play a significant and growing role in the state's energy future even when federal subsidies decline in coming years.
"We're in chapter three of a 50-chapter book," says Joel Mickey, director of market design and development for the state's electric-grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT.
Elsewhere, most of the renewable growth is coming from blue states. California is the leader in solar power with more systems cranking out electricity, right now, than what Texas hopes to add in the next five to 10 years. New York finalized a plan Aug. 1 to get to half its power from zero-emission sources by 2030, with big goals for offshore wind turbines. And wind farms provided Iowans with nearly a third of their electricity last year -- the largest percentage of any state. Texas remains one of the few reliably Republican states to jump on the bandwagon.
Its transformation hasn't come without risks. In the early days, the state government charged electric-system users billions of dollars to build transmission lines needed to get power from windy West Texas to power-hungry cities. There was also a steep learning curve. Renewable power is only available when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. It can't be dispatched precisely when it's needed but just when it's available, meaning grid officials have had to become obsessive about anticipating weather. Efficient battery-storage technologies remain elusive.
Then there is the issue of subsidies. Wind projects get hefty federal payouts whenever they generate electricity. At auctions, this means they can sometimes pay the state to take their electricity and still make money, undercutting the business model of fossil-fuel generators.
Some critics worry this could lead power companies to decommission fossil-fuel plants prematurely -- even though some fuel sources such as natural gas and coal are arguably cheaper these days.
"How do we keep big plants online if wind and solar have eroded the economics to the point that companies want to close them?" asks Travis Fisher, an economist with the Institute for Energy Research, a conservative think tank.
The roots of Texas' renewables boom go back to 1999, when then-Gov. George W. Bush and a Republican-dominated legislature overhauled the Texas power market. The free market-oriented deregulation broke the grip of most monopoly utilities that controlled generation, transmission and retail sales of electricity and introduced competitive auctions for wholesale power.
The deregulation plan, which Mr. Bush signed just days after announcing he would run for the presidency, also included a government-imposed requirement to have at least 2,000 megawatts of renewable generating capacity by 2009.
Texas blew past that goal in 2005. Then Gov. Rick Perry, also a Republican and no fan of government intervention, raised the goal to 10,000 megawatts by 2025. Texas hit that target in 2011 and kept going. In April, there was more than 19,000 megawatts of renewable capacity, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, cranking out enough power for nearly 4 million Texas homes.
Texas officials didn't invoke global warming to sell the program. They touted renewable energy as a consumer-choice issue, jobs producer and a way to pump money into rural counties.
Jimmy Glotfelty, Mr. Bush's gubernatorial policy director from 1991 to 1994, says his boss "grew up in Midland where the wind blew all the time" and it gave him a hunch wind power could be a huge asset for the state. "It wasn't part of the climate-change revolution but a belief in free markets and entrepreneurs."
A recent poll conducted by the Texas Clean Energy Coalition, a nonpartisan group that supports the growth of gas as well renewable energy, found that despite strong distaste for federal environmental regulations aimed at reducing coal, 85% of Texans favored expanding renewables while 9% were opposed. Among Republicans and those who described themselves as ideologically conservative, nearly 80% favored those sources.
Residents of Houston currently can pick from 107 different rate plans offering 5% to 100% renewable power. In general, they are willing to pay a bit more to go green. Top-rated Reliant, a unit of NRG Energy Inc., charges 7.1 cents a kilowatt-hour for the plan that's all renewable versus 5.9 cents for one that's 5% green.
Federal subsidies are scheduled to shrink in coming years. An equally big driver of renewables has been the falling costs of solar and wind technology. Solar costs are down 48% since 2010, including a 6% drop last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. Those reductions are likely to continue as solar-panel manufacturers achieve economies of scale and new technologies cut costs and increase efficiency.
"[Texas] wants to have a diversity of resources because no one knows what gas prices will be in the future," says Joel Cohn, at CohnReznick, an accounting tax advisory in New York that advises on renewable projects.
The state's grid operator, ERCOT, expects explosive growth in solar. One analysis suggested the recent extension of the federal solar tax credit could lead to as much as 19,000 megawatts of solar capacity being built within 15 years, up from roughly 500 megawatts today. Texas is poised to vault from 10th place among states in solar capacity to second in the next five years, behind only California, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Wind projects, including construction of power lines, created jobs in rural counties and gave landowners new sources of income. The state now has more than 100,000 people working in renewable energy, according to the Texas Workforce Commission, which is responsible for jobs creation.
Two sites in San Antonio operated by the city's utility, CPS Energy, embody the change. The J.T. Deely generating plant, where smokestacks loom over piles of coal, is being retired. A few miles away, CPS's two-year-old Alamo 2 solar farm, nestled between a pair of suburban neighborhoods, turns sunlight into electricity. As a few dozen sheep and a llama keep the grass in check, solar developer Randy Jenks notes the appeal.
"It's clean. It's quiet. People want it here," he says, standing beside a few of the 17,920 solar modules that make up the 45-acre facility. When all phases of the Alamo solar venture are completed, it is expected to exceed 450 megawatts, or more solar capacity than existed in the whole state a couple of years ago.
Mr. Jenks started out in oil-and-gas exploration in the 1980s, then moved into wind power in the 1990s. Now he's pursuing what he and his employer, OCI Solar Power, which is part of OCI Company of South Korea, see as the next big thing for Texas.
Back in 2010, CPS started thinking about solar. By 2012, it was ready to bet big. The utility signed deals with OCI Solar to build what would eventually be 450 megawatts of solar generating capacity -- 50% more than in all of Texas even now -- on the condition OCI set up its manufacturing operations nearby and create at least 800 local jobs.
Now the city boasts its own solar industrial base, with all of the solar panels for its facilities manufactured locally. OCI and suppliers it brought to San Antonio are now lining up orders from developers in Mexico and other parts of the U.S.
Renewables are still a tiny part of CPS's business, but its leadership expects them to grow rapidly.
"The cost has come down to the point where people can really see the value," said Cris Eugster, the chief operating officer for San Antonio's utility, CPS Energy.

Full text:   In "The Climate Prosecutors Can't Dodge Congress Forever" (op-ed, Aug. 22) Elizabeth Price Foley focuses on how global-warming activists don't want people to discuss the influence of human activity on climate change. The actions taken by the collaborating state attorneys general illustrate the extremes some activists will take to suppress debate.
The idea that global-warming ideology cannot be questioned brings to mind a quote by Nobel laureate physicist, Richard Feynman: "I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned." Hopefully, the congressional investigations into the activities of the state attorneys general will shed light on the absurdity of forcing acceptance of answers that can't be questioned.

It is good news that "climate prosecutors can't dodge Congress forever." Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who demanded full disclosure from Exxon Mobil and conservative think tanks regarding all communications dealing with climate research, insists that Congress demanding full disclosure regarding her investigation is an unconstitutional "affront to states' rights."
However, if a witch hunt by the state attorneys general to find evidence of manipulation or unacceptable interpretation of climate research by Exxon Mobil is protected from congressional scrutiny, what about investigations of individuals and entities that pay for or generate research regarding the minimum wage, gender pay gap, income inequality or tax rates? State attorneys general could use subpoena power to silence researchers and companies with whom they disagree.
Our constitutional rights will be protected if the attorneys general have to reveal their findings.

Full text:   The Brooklyn Botanic Garden has embarked on a $17.2 million overhaul intended to slash consumption and waste of one of the garden's most critical resources: water.
Each year, the botanic garden uses about 22 million gallons of water to fill a 1-acre pool in its Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden. That water flows by stream to a smaller pond to the south, and is eventually discharged into the municipal sewer system.
That annual draw -- which doesn't include water used for irrigation -- will shrink by about 95% to an estimated 900,000 gallons under a high-tech water conservation project now under way. Botanic garden officials say it is the first of this scale and complexity in North America.
The goal: to reduce the botanic garden's environmental footprint.
"Horticulture in the West is all about water conservation, and yet the global climate change prediction models suggest we might see more droughty summers here in the Northeast," said Scot Medbury, the garden's president and chief executive.
The first component of the water-management project, a new 1.5-acre water garden with lush plantings around a pond, will be unveiled next month at the southern end of the botanic garden.
When completed, the system will capture much of the rainwater that falls on the 52-acre garden and recirculate it back up to the Japanese garden pond.
"This is, in essence, a plumbing project," said Mr. Medbury.
The project is also intended to help ease the burden on New York City's antiquated sewer system by reducing the amount of water discharged from the lower pond during major storms.
That runoff, along with storm water washing off city streets, mingles with sewage bound for wastewater-treatment plants. When heavy rain or snow overwhelms capacity at those plants, they discharge untreated sewage and storm water to local waterways.
A weather-monitoring component in the botanic-garden project will use satellite technology and computer modeling to lower water levels in the pond before bad weather arrives.
Officials at the garden hope the initiative will serve as a model for other institutions.
The water garden is named for philanthropist Shelby White and her late husband Leon Levy, who through his namesake foundation contributed $7.5 million to the broader capital campaign that funded the project. Other funders include various New York City agencies and offices, the City Council and the Robert W. Wilson Charitable Trust.
The effort is unfolding in stages.
After the water garden opens in September, workers will begin to bury the pipes that recirculate water back up to the Japanese garden pond.
The stream that connects the two ponds -- now a ditchlike channel -- will be reconfigured to add a deep U-shaped curve and additional plantings.
The botanic garden also intends to push some pathways closer to the stream, to open up views and make the waterway more prominent.
The project, which is expected to be done by 2018, is among the garden's larger recent capital efforts. They include a $28 million new visitor center unveiled in 2012.
One big challenge on this one: discreetly incorporating the complex technology that makes the water-conservation features possible.
"We're trying to make an infrastructure component look like part of the garden," said Matthew Bird, a landscape designer at Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, which designed the project.
He said the plan involved integrating three different systems: filtration, recirculating and volume control.
"Each of those is difficult to get right by itself, and we need to make sure they are all coordinated and communicating," he added.
Earlier this week, workers were putting the finishing touches on the water garden. Potted shrubs and plants stood in staging areas; sprinklers watered springy stretches of newly installed turf.
Once a flat stretch of ground around a nondescript pond, the area now features a curving body of water whose banks are planted with great blue lobelia and other species that can adjust to fluctuating water levels.
With its black tupelo trees, glossy sedges and thick stands of giant hyssop, the new wetland area is meant to lure both visitors and wildlife, from bees to migratory birds.
Benches and rock perches on elevated sections offer views of the new landscape, which is designed to illustrate the range and adaptive nature of freshwater ecosystems.
Belle's Brook, the stream that funnels water down through the botanic garden, now connects to a large settlement pond intended to capture sediment swept into the waterway by rainfall. From there, the water will flow through a rock weir and into the main south pond.
Hidden from view: a biofilter to help improve water quality. Another will be installed upstream.
Donor Shelby White, an enthusiastic supporter of conservation and gardening projects, grew up in nearby Flatbush and visited the Brooklyn Botanic Garden as a child. As a novice gardener, she relied on its guidebooks, she said.
"The garden can go from 22 million gallons of water just disappearing to saving it," said Ms. White, a Leon Levy Foundation trustee who also serves on the boards of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. "We hope other people will pay attention to that and learn from what happens."

Full text:   Yes, disclosure of climate-related economic risks is important, but on its own will accomplish very little ("Enlist the Market in the Climate-Change Fight," op-ed, Aug. 19). I had hoped that Brian Deese and Jeff Zients would then move to the essential second step: creating incentives for the market to deliver solutions to climate change.
I have spent most of my Wall Street career assessing risk and trying to make sure that it is priced appropriately. As climate change exacts a growing toll on businesses and individuals, we must provide the market with the proper incentives.
That means that carbon, which is the main ingredient in greenhouse gases, can no longer have a free ride. It should be priced to reflect the costs it imposes on all of us. An overwhelming majority of economists believe that a carbon tax or fee is the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions. Members of Congress who have reservations should see the sizable proceeds of such a fee as a way to fund a reduction in the corporate-tax rate and other tax reforms. Some of the money could fund infrastructure repair.
However we use that revenue, reliance on the market to tackle this problem is far better than continued reliance on government regulations.

The economic risks to corporations, and governments, from climate change are infinitesimal compared to the economic risk from government-imposed regulations and standards requiring consideration and disclosure of such risks. The market is well able to evaluate risks it considers significant.
L.C. Bohrer

Despite the lack of any significant warming in almost two decades and no empirical evidence that storms are increasing in frequency or severity, the government's climate alarmists nevertheless demand standardized disclosures of climate risk.
Too many government jobs now depend on the climate-change agenda, such that if the problem goes away, then so will the funding. H.L. Mencken summed it up when he famously said: "The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary."
John DiChiara

The article has a very insidious "take it as gospel" undertone that somehow corporations, government entities and others can actually have a significant impact on climate change. There is no hard evidence that somehow, after millions of years of natural climate change, human activity can be controlled sufficiently to effect climate change.
Roland Ley

The main goal in the Obama administration's climate-change reporting push is to require all companies doing business with the federal government to disclose what they are doing about climate change. It would enlist in the army of climate warriors 140 million pension beneficiaries who need more information about climate-risk exposure in portfolios that support their pension benefits. Pension-plan participants have lots of things to worry about these days, but the benefit-security threat from investments that have climate-risk exposure isn't one of them. According to the authors, "The stakes for our economy are too high to stand still or move backward" in the climate-change fight. Given the weak economic record of the Obama administration and probable skyrocketing costs of an anticarbon agenda, standing still on climate policy for a few more months is the best way forward.

Full text:   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump promised Monday to repeal a host of energy and environmental regulations, save the coal industry and lift restrictions on energy sales.
But many of those promises may be challenging to fulfill. A new president cannot easily cancel most regulations, which require a lengthy, exacting process to enact or withdraw.
More broadly, many of the coal industry's woes are driven by world-wide market trends that are likely to persist.
Mr. Trump, addressing a business-friendly audience at the Detroit Economic Club, painted a vision of a restored energy future. "We will put our coal miners and our steelworkers back to work, where they want to be," Mr. Trump said.
In an outline accompanying the speech, Mr. Trump cited several targets: Environmental Protection Agency rules that cut carbon emissions from power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan; the EPA's Waters of the U.S. rule, which brings more water bodies under federal protection; and an Interior Department moratorium on new coal leasing on federal lands.
But few finalized regulations have ever been successfully undone by a succeeding administration, Republican or Democratic. And those that did fall were far less politically charged than the Obama administration's regulations at issue today.
Robert Murray, the controlling owner of the nation's largest privately held coal miner and a Trump supporter, called Mr. Trump's promises "a very good start."
The chief executive of Murray Energy Corp. has been an outspoken opponent of the Obama administration, accusing the executive branch of rampaging over fossil fuels. "New regulations on coal, they're coming out faster than we can read them," he said, adding that market forces have also not been kind to his sector.
"We need to develop all the energy we can and then use it, whatever the low-cost energy is," Mr. Murray said.
Mr. Trump also said Monday he would cancel the Paris climate agreement. While Mr. Trump can't cancel the entire deal himself, he could withdraw the U.S. from it, which could be a deal-breaking blow to the agreement given the high-profile role of the U.S.
The regulation Mr. Trump might find easiest to undo is the Interior Department's moratorium on new coal leasing, because it isn't a formal regulation but the department's current policy.

Full text:   The Environmental Protection Agency advanced plans Monday to limit carbon emissions from aircraft, one of a string of actions President Barack Obama is pursuing in his climate agenda that affects large swaths of the U.S. economy.
The EPA issued a final scientific assessment concluding carbon emissions from aircraft endanger public health and welfare, a legal prerequisite the agency must take before regulating those emissions.
Whether the EPA follows through with proposed rules depends largely on who wins the November presidential election, as any rule couldn't be completed by January.
Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has said she would keep pursuing and expand Mr. Obama's climate regulations. Republican nominee Donald Trump has questioned the scientific findings underpinning the administration's climate rules and has vowed to repeal them.
EPA officials said last year, when first proposing the aircraft scientific assessment, that any regulation would be implemented in coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations, which is drafting a global standard for airline carbon emissions.
Emissions from aircraft represent about 2% of total global carbon emissions, and the U.S. is the largest contributor to global aviation greenhouse gases, according to federal data. The EPA said aircraft are the third-largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions in the U.S. transportation sector, accounting for about 3% of such emissions.
"EPA has already set effective [greenhouse gas] standards for cars and trucks, and any future aircraft-engine standards will also provide important climate and public-health benefits," said Janet McCabe, EPA acting assistant administrator for air and radiation.
The finding issued Monday is the latest in an array of regulatory actions the Obama administration has taken over the last several years to clamp down on greenhouse-gas emissions that most scientists blame for climate change.
EPA officials indicated on Monday that the agency could eventually adopt standards stronger than global standards adopted by the ICAO.
The EPA's scientific finding applies to 89% of U.S. aircraft carbon emissions, with exemptions for military and small piston-engine planes often used for recreational purposes.
Airlines for America, the trade association representing U.S. airlines and air cargo carriers, said it commends the EPA's action because it is working within the coming international framework.
"As aviation is a global industry, with airlines operating internationally and aircraft manufacturers selling their aircraft in international markets, it is critical that aircraft emissions standards be set at the international level and not imposed unilaterally by one country or set of countries," said Vaughn Jennings, spokesman for Airlines for America.
Environmental groups also praised the move.
"EPA's endangerment finding today sets the stage for the U.S. to step up," said Annie Petsonk, international counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Abstract: Whereas he is correct that CO2 released from the oxidation of food (derived from plants and animals via respiration) is closely balanced by the synthesis of food stuff by plants, CO2, water and the sun's light; he is incorrect in averring that the CO2 released from fossil fuel oxidation is handled differently.

Full text:   With all of the politicking around climate change, it was refreshing to read Bruce E. Dale's attempt to bring some chemical understanding to the debate ("Old MacDonald Had a . . . Climate Offender," op-ed, July 11). Whereas he is correct that CO2 released from the oxidation of food (derived from plants and animals via respiration) is closely balanced by the synthesis of food stuff by plants, CO2, water and the sun's light; he is incorrect in averring that the CO2 released from fossil fuel oxidation is handled differently.
The remarkable chloroplast doesn't differentiate between atmospheric CO2 derived from the oxidation of food stuff and that from fossil fuels. The important distinction is that the plant foods are replenished much more quickly (simultaneously) than fossil fuel (eons). This dialogue would be enhanced further if other feedback chemical mechanisms involving carbon were discussed: the effect of warming on water evaporation, rainfall and weathering of carbonates; the effect of increased atmospheric water and CO2 on photosynthesis; the effect of atmospheric CO2 on leaf stomata and green plant water requirements; and the buffering and chemical interactions among CO2, carbonates and bicarbonates on our land and sea.

---
Grow enough plants and you could, at least in theory, remove all of the CO2 from the atmosphere.
Do farmers get to sell carbon credits on any of the carbon exchanges currently operating? If not, why not? Electric-car manufacturers do, and all they can claim is that the use of their vehicles doesn't directly produce CO2, though obviously the sources of the electricity they use do. While the carbon in the crops from farmers may ultimately return to the atmosphere as CO2, it enters the farmer's realm when CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and incorporated into the crops, and there is a fairly long period before the last of it is returned to the atmosphere. Farmers therefore provide at least a temporary depot for atmospheric carbon, for which I think they deserve some credit, maybe even some carbon credits.

Abstract: Policies aimed at meeting the goals of December's international accord on greenhouse-gas emissions will lead to changes such as carbon pricing, and there is a risk that financial markets will adjust abruptly, said Mr. Carney, chairman of the Financial Stability Board, which has been asked by the Group of 20 industrialized nations to look at the issues around risk to the financial system from climate change and climate-change policy.

Full text:   TORONTO -- Only one-third of the world's biggest 1,000 companies are providing enough disclosure to investors about the potential impact of carbon pricing on their businesses, Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney told a business audience in Toronto.
Policies aimed at meeting the goals of December's international accord on greenhouse-gas emissions will lead to changes such as carbon pricing, and there is a risk that financial markets will adjust abruptly, said Mr. Carney, chairman of the Financial Stability Board, which has been asked by the Group of 20 industrialized nations to look at the issues around risk to the financial system from climate change and climate-change policy.
"The thing that keeps central bankers up at night is the sort of sudden change in risk," Mr. Carney said to underscore the importance of disclosure in guarding against shocks to the financial system.
Mr. Carney, also responsible for regulating the U.K.'s banks and insurers, said that in addition to the lack of disclosure, there is a risk to investors from catastrophic climate events that may affect insurers and reinsurers. He said there is also a growing recognition that the insurance industry may have a "lurking issue" around the potential liability of company directors in lawsuits involving climate disclosure.
The importance of disclosing the climate-related risks companies are facing, Mr. Carney said, is supported by the emphasis that money managers -- including BlackRock Inc.'s Chief Executive Laurence Fink -- are now placing on sustainable long-term earnings growth rather than short-term gains.
With interest rates low and economic growth relatively weak, "longer-term strategies are going to be much more important for value creation, [and climate change] is one of the issues that companies are going to have to address," Mr. Carney said.
In addition to developing regulation around disclosure and other climate-change issues, there is also a push to adopt standards for new types of securities being developed to help fund green projects as countries seek new sources of financing to help lower their carbon emissions.
For example, member countries of the G-20 are trying to develop a global standard for green bonds to appease any concerns investors may still have with the asset class, Mr. Carney said. Green bonds are debt securities specifically used to help pay for energy-efficient buildings, improvements to water and sewer systems and mass transit.
The BOE has been working with the People's Bank of China over the past year to develop a green-bond market as part of the Asian nation's efforts to finance projects that reduce carbon emissions, Mr. Carney said. Bond yields in China "are considerably higher" than in countries such as Canada and the U.K., and the Chinese government is motivated to develop its market for green bonds, he said.
The Chinese government, though, faces the potential challenge of convincing global investors that issuers can meet the disclosure standards of countries with more-developed debt markets.
"You have got this new market [with] the potential of $500 billion a year, high-yielding duration" and an asset class that "should be of the standard of a global fixed-income market," Mr. Carney said, referring to efforts by Chinese banks to develop green bonds. "That is tangible opportunity."
He took only two questions, and sidestepped responding to one about Brexit, last month's U.K. vote to exit from the European Union.

Full text:   Bruce E. Dale's July 11 op-ed "Old MacDonald Had a . . . Climate Offender" paints a picture of the Clean Power Plan -- and the underlying science -- that is far from reality.
First, EPA's Clean Power Plan, which is stayed while legal challenges proceed, applies to power plants, not farms. Under the program, states determine their own strategies for cutting carbon emissions from power plants, including the opportunity to use qualified biomass in place of fossil fuels. The agency recognizes that a wide range of agricultural and forest biomass can provide carbon benefits, including controlling atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels. Contrary to Mr. Dale's claim that this program creates an "unjustified carbon tax," it actually creates a market for biomass and an economic opportunity for American farmers.
Second, his basic premise that biogenic emissions cannot contribute to climate change is out of step with the science. Peer-reviewed scientific literature reflects that all carbon emissions (both biogenic and fossil) once in the atmosphere drive climate change equally and endanger public health and welfare.
Mr. Dale also ignores the fact that determining how emissions from using biomass at power plants affects atmospheric carbon levels is a complex scientific question -- one that must take into account the way biomass is produced and, in some cases, what would happen to the biomass if it is not used for energy. This is exactly why the EPA is in the midst of a very open and public process, working with the agency's independent Science Advisory Board, to explore this topic.
We've invited input from all stakeholders to help find policy solutions that are based on sound science, provide states with a clear path for using biomass and protect our health and climate for future generations.

Full text:   Your editorial "The Climate Police Crack-Up" (July 8) presents the good news for free-speech advocates that two state attorneys general walked back their subpoenas against Exxon Mobil Corp, "tacitly admitting that their climate-change harassment lacks a legal basis."
The bad news of climate-change harassment, however, came a week earlier in "Exxon Touts Carbon Tax to Rivals" (Business & Tech., July 1) that reported Exxon is lobbying other U.S. energy companies to support a tax on carbon emissions.
If the true goal of the state attorneys general and climate activists who were harassing Exxon (along with other groups producing research challenging the left's climate consensus) was to get past research and into action, mission accomplished at Exxon without risk of an embarrassing loss in court.
Climate activists long for a carbon-reduction policy with teeth, so having Exxon step in as the first major U.S. oil company to join European energy companies in embracing a carbon tax was far better than pursuing a long-shot charge of climate-research deception.
The IRS did not have to prove tax-law abuse by conservative groups in 2012 in order to shut them up during President Barack Obama's bid for re-election -- prolonged audits did the trick. Banks that have spent billions of dollars in order to comply with onerous Dodd-Frank regulations may now prefer to stick with the regulatory regime they know rather than speak out against it (and anger Democrats).
Harassment of corporate executives and boycotts of their businesses can stop corporate donations to conservative political causes, if other regulatory efforts to stifle free speech come up short.
The state attorneys general claimed that Exxon and climate researchers deliberately understated the likelihood and dire consequences of dramatic climate change. Exxon is advocating a new carbon tax to mitigate the consequences of climate change. Speaking out in favor of a carbon tax covers a multitude of climate sins. It was time to take some of the heat off of Exxon.

Airport Raised Up
For Climate Change
Singapore is building its newest airport terminal at a higher elevation and creating sea walls along its coast as the island city-state seeks to protect itself from possible flooding due to global climate change.
The proposed Terminal 5 at Changi Airport will be built 18 feet above the mean sea level, which is higher than other areas in Singapore, the government said Sunday. The terminal is due to be completed by the middle of the next decade.
The mean sea level in the Singapore Strait rose at the rate of 0.047 inch to 0.067 inch a year from 1975 to 2009, according to the National Climate Change Secretariat of Singapore.

JAPAN
'Abenomics' Wins
Backing of Youths
Japanese in their teens and 20s backed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition in Sunday's parliamentary voting, according to exit polls, a sign that the prime minister's "Abenomics" economic package and his hawkish security policy were well-received.
The national election was the first time 18- and 19-year-olds could vote in a national election after a 2015 legal change. Mr. Abe's Liberal Democratic Party and a coalition ally won 70 of the 121 seats up for grabs in the upper house.
According to an election-day survey, 40% of 18- and 19-year-olds voted for the generally conservative LDP, and more than 40% of those in their 20s and 30s.
Economists and political scientists say Japan's youth are more conservative than older generations after growing up during years of economic turmoil.

Full text:   A basic fact about agricultural products such as grains and oilseeds is that the carbon in them, called biogenic carbon, came from the atmosphere. Biogenic carbon will return to the atmosphere when these products are consumed, such as when human beings eat bread and then breathe out the carbon dioxide resulting from the breakdown of bread in the body. Biogenic carbon therefore cannot contribute to climate change.
Why is the Environmental Protection Agency denying this basic fact of climate science? The EPA is counting biogenic-carbon emissions as if they were the same as fossil-carbon emissions. They are not the same. Carbon atoms emitted by burning fossil fuels are, in effect, on a one-way trip from the ground to the atmosphere, where they will stay for hundreds of millions of years. In contrast, carbon atoms taken from the atmosphere to make agricultural products are on a round trip from the atmosphere to farms then back to the atmosphere.
The EPA intends to penalize American farmers and those who make modern energy and bioproducts such as plastics from agricultural feedstocks by treating biogenic carbon like fossil carbon. As part of its approach, the EPA is now attempting to regulate "sustainability" in the farm field.
The agency's new Clean Power Plan proposes to penalize biogenic carbon emissions unless food processors (bakeries, brewers, grain processors) or energy producers (like utilities using seed hulls to produce electricity) can prove that they used "sustainably-derived" agricultural feedstocks. The definition of "sustainably-derived" and the proposed penalties go on for many pages in the proposed regulations. They defy easy summary. But the proposed regulation on biogenic carbon is simply and clearly an unjustified carbon tax on American farmers.
The EPA is trying to put itself in charge of regulating farms -- an outstanding example of "mission creep" and bureaucratic overreach. Regulating agriculture is not the EPA's job -- we already have an Agriculture Department. The EPA's approach would demand proof of exactly which farm produced every pound of corn, wheat, soy or cottonseed used by customers of those farms -- a practical impossibility in the U.S. agricultural system.
There is a growing world-wide effort to establish the "bioeconomy," an economy based on use of renewable raw materials to make the products that humans need, and to reduce and eventually eliminate dependence on fossil carbon. The aim is essential -- the world will eventually run out of fossil carbon. Yet sound policy must be informed by sound science. The EPA's treatment of biogenic carbon and fossil carbon as if they were identical is wrong at the most basic scientific level. America's farmers and the consumers of what they produce would be collateral damage of the EPA's misguided plans.

Full text:   A strange thing happened to mothers and fathers and children at the end of the 20th century. It was called "parenting." As long as there have been human beings, mothers and fathers and many others have taken special care of children. But the word "parenting" didn't appear in the U.S. until 1958, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, and became common only in the 1970s.
People sometimes use "parenting" just to describe what parents actually do, but more often, especially now, "parenting" means something that parents should do. "To parent" is a goal-directed verb; it describes a job, a kind of work. The goal is to somehow turn your child into a better or happier or more successful adult--better than they would be otherwise, or (though we whisper this) better than the children next door. The right kind of "parenting" will produce the right kind of child, who in turn will become the right kind of adult.
The idea that parents can learn special techniques that will make their children turn out better is ubiquitous in middle-class America--so ubiquitous that it might seem obvious. But this prescriptive picture is fundamentally misguided. It's the wrong way to understand how parents and children actually think and act, and it's equally wrong as a vision of how they should think and act.
Taking care of children has always been a central, and difficult, human project. Our children depend on us for much longer than the children of any other animals. By the time they are 7, young chimpanzees gather as much food as they consume. Even in hunter-gatherer groups, human children don't do that until they're at least 15.
So you need lots of people to take care of human children, not just mothers but fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers, uncles and aunts and siblings and cousins and even friends. Biologists have shown that humans evolved a unique network of care. Unlike our nearest primate relatives, extended family and "alloparents" (unrelated helpers) all combine to take care of those needy kids.
For most of human history, we lived in these extended family groups. This meant that we learned how to take care of children by practicing with our own little sisters and baby cousins and by watching many other people take care of children.
But toward the end of the 20th century, families got much smaller and more scattered, people had children later, and middle-class parents spent more time working and going to school. The traditional sources of wisdom and competence weren't available any more.
Today, most middle-class parents spend years taking classes and pursuing careers before they have children. It's not surprising, then, that going to school and working are modern parents' models for taking care of children: You go to school and work with a goal in mind, and you can be taught to do better at school and work.
Working to achieve a particular outcome is a good model for many crucial human enterprises. It's the right model for carpenters or writers or businessmen. You can judge whether you are a good carpenter or writer or CEO by the quality of your chairs, your books or your bottom line. In the "parenting" picture, a parent is a kind of carpenter; the goal, however, is not to produce a particular kind of product, like a chair, but a particular kind of person.
In work, expertise leads to success. The promise of "parenting" is that there is some set of techniques, some particular expertise, that parents could acquire that would help them accomplish the goal of shaping their children's lives. And a sizable industry has emerged that promises to provide exactly that expertise. Some 60,000 books are in the parenting section on Amazon, and many of them have "how to" somewhere in the title.
The scientific study of development provides very little support for this picture. It's true that childhood experiences can influence adult life: Children who are poor or neglected are more likely to have problems as adults, and enrolling those children in high-quality preschools makes their lives better later on.
But middle-class parents obsess about small variations in parenting techniques. Should you co-sleep with your babies or let them cry it out? Should strollers face front or back? How much homework should children have? How much time should they spend on the computer? There is almost no evidence that any of this has much predictable effect on what children will be like when they grow up.
Does this mean that parents don't matter? To the contrary: From a scientific perspective, being a parent, as opposed to "parenting," is crucially important, but it's important in a very different way.
Why do we have such a long immaturity, such an extended childhood, with all the cost that entails? Our long human childhood (and the major investment in caring for children that goes with it) is one of the keys to human evolutionary success.
More than any other animal, we human beings depend on our ability to learn. And the current thinking is that our large brain and powerful learning abilities evolved, most of all, to deal with change.
The immediate trigger for human evolution seems to have been a period of unpredictable climate variability in the Pleistocene era. It wasn't just that the weather got warmer or colder, but that it moved from one extreme to the other in an unpredictable way. Humans are causing climate change now, but in the evolutionary past, climate change caused humans.
On top of that, human beings were nomadic, moving from environment to environment, and, thanks to culture, each new generation could create and modify its own environment. All this meant that humans had to adapt to an exceptionally wide range of exceptionally variable environments.
One way that the human species may have evolved to deal with this variability was by nurturing a wide range of children with very different temperaments and abilities. This helped to ensure that someone or other in a new generation would have the skills to cope with the unpredictable and unforeseeable environments that they might face.
Human learning contributes even more to the variability of our children. Our parental investment and commitment allow each generation a chance to think up new ideas about how the world works and how to make it work better. Childhood provides a period of variability and possibility, exploration and innovation, learning and imagination.
Many animals have minds that are exquisitely adapted to just one particular environment. Our minds can change in unpredictable ways to match unpredictable environments. But this strategy has a drawback: You can't simultaneously learn about a new environment and act on it effectively. You don't want to be stuck figuring out how to deal with a mammoth while it's charging at you.
The evolutionary solution to that trade-off is to give each new human being protectors--people who make sure that children have a chance to thrive, learn and imagine before they have to fend for themselves. Those protectors also pass on the knowledge that previous generations have accumulated.
If "parenting" is the wrong model, then, what's the right one? Let's recall that "parent" is not actually a verb, nor is it a form of work. What we need to talk about instead is "being a parent"--that is, caring for a child. To be a parent is to be part of a profound and unique human relationship, to engage in a particular kind of love, not to make a certain sort of thing.
After all, to be a wife is not to engage in "wifing," to be a friend is not to "friend," even on Facebook, and we don't "child" our mothers and fathers. Yet these relationships are central to who we are. Any human being living a fully satisfied life is immersed in such social connections.
Talking about love, especially the love of parents for their children, may sound sentimental and mushy and simple and obvious. But like all human relationships, our love for our children is at once a part of the everyday texture of our lives and enormously complicated, variable and even paradoxical.
We can work to love better without thinking of love as a kind of work. We might say that we try hard to be a good wife or husband, or that it's important to us to be a good friend or a better child.
But I wouldn't evaluate the success of my marriage by measuring whether my husband's character had improved in the years since we wed. I wouldn't evaluate the quality of an old friendship by whether my friend was happier or more successful than when we first met. This, however, is the implicit standard of "parenting"--that your qualities as a parent can be, and even should be, judged by the child you create.
The most important rewards of being a parent aren't your children's grades and trophies--or even their graduations and weddings. They come from the moment-by-moment physical and psychological joy of being with this particular child, and in that child's moment-by-moment joy in being with you.
Instead of valuing "parenting," we should value "being a parent." Instead of thinking about caring for children as a kind of work, aimed at producing smart or happy or successful adults, we should think of it as a kind of love. Love doesn't have goals or benchmarks or blueprints, but it does have a purpose. Love's purpose is not to shape our beloved's destiny but to help them shape their own.
What should parents do? The scientific picture fits what we all know already, although knowing doesn't make it any easier: We unconditionally commit to love and care for this particular child. We do this even though all children are different, all parents are different, and we have no idea beforehand what our child will be like. We try to give our children a strong sense of safety and stability. We do this even though the whole point of that safe base is to encourage children to take risks and have adventures. And we try to pass on our knowledge, wisdom and values to our children, even though we know that they will revise that knowledge, challenge that wisdom and reshape those values.
In fact, the very point of commitment, nurture and culture is to allow variation, risk and innovation. Even if we could precisely shape our children into particular adults, that would defeat the whole evolutionary purpose of childhood.
We follow our intuitions, muddle through and hope for the best.
Perhaps the best metaphor for understanding our distinctive relationship to children is an old one. Caring for children is like tending a garden, and being a parent is like being a gardener. When we garden, we work and sweat and we're often up to our ears in manure. We do it to create a protected and nurturing space for plants to flourish.
As all gardeners know, nothing works out the way we planned. The greatest pleasures and triumphs, as well as disasters, are unexpected. There is a deeper reason behind this.
A good garden, like any good ecosystem, is dynamic, variable and resilient. Consider what it takes to create a meadow or a hedgerow or a cottage garden. The glory of a meadow is its messiness: The different grasses and flowers may flourish or perish as circumstances alter, and there is no guarantee that any individual plant will become the tallest, or fairest or most long-blooming. The good gardener works to create fertile soil that can sustain a whole ecosystem of different plants with different strengths and beauties--and with different weaknesses and difficulties, too.
Unlike a good chair, a good garden is constantly changing, as it adapts to the changing circumstances of the weather and the seasons. And in the long run, that kind of varied, flexible, complex, dynamic system will be more robust and adaptable than the most carefully tended hothouse bloom.
As individual parents and as a community, our job is not to shape our children's minds; it is to let those minds explore all the possibilities that the world allows. Our job is not to make a particular kind of child but to provide a protected space of love, safety and stability in which children of many unpredictable kinds can flourish.
It's not easy to be a parent, especially in the U.S. right now. It takes time and energy and money to provide the support and nurture that children need. We evolved in small-scale societies, where an extended group of caregivers could spontaneously provide resources for the children they loved. In a big, postindustrial world, we treat most human activities as if they were either a kind of production or a kind of consumption--so that raising children is seen as either very badly paid work or a very expensive kind of luxury.
But the "parenting" industry isn't the answer. Instead, we have to find a way to help parents be parents, and to provide the love and care that all children deserve.

Full text:   Exxon Mobil Corp. is ramping up its lobbying of other energy companies to support a carbon tax, marking a shift in the oil giant's approach to climate change as the industry faces growing pressure to address the politically charged issue.
Exxon's official position has long been the same -- a carbon tax is the best way to address the risks of warming temperatures -- but it has done little to actively advocate for that goal in recent years. Lately, Exxon has been making the case with its U.S. counterparts to support a carbon tax, arguing that the industry must not oppose all climate policies, according to people familiar with Exxon's thinking.
Top Exxon officials have been more vocal about their support for a carbon tax and have met with Capitol Hill offices about related legislation, according to the company's recent lobby disclosure forms.
For the past six months, Exxon has been asserting its position more in meetings within trade associations, including the American Petroleum Institute and American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, according to multiple reports from people who have attended meetings with Exxon officials.
"Of the policy options being considered by governments, we believe a revenue-neutral carbon tax is the best," Suzanne McCarron, the company's vice president of public and government affairs, wrote in May in the Dallas Morning News.
A straightforward carbon tax that is revenue-neutral -- meaning other taxes should be lowered to offset the impact -- is far preferable to the patchwork of current and potential regulations on the state, federal and international levels, according to Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers.
Mr. Jeffers said Exxon's position hasn't changed and pointed to a recent House vote on a resolution condemning a carbon tax and the global climate deal in Paris agreed to last December as reasons for the increased debate within the industry.
A carbon tax would put a price on each ton of carbon emitted. Where in the production and consumption process the tax would be levied depends on individual proposals.
"Previously Exxon's positioning on a carbon tax had been passive -- 'Hey, we're not loving it, but we're not going to get in the way of it,' " said Michael McKenna, president of the energy lobbying firm MWR Strategies, whose clients include oil and refining companies, but not Exxon. "In just the last six months, there's been an uptick in how they are asserting themselves in meetings about how to address this issue."
Exxon, the world's largest publicly owned oil company, arguably faces more pressure than other firms to show concern about climate change. At least two Democratic state attorneys general are investigating whether the oil giant has conspired to cover up what it knows about the impact of global warming.
The U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general agreed to withdraw its subpoena, according to a legal filing Wednesday. Exxon is challenging these investigations and has described them as politically motivated attacks that violate its constitutional rights.
In actively pushing for a carbon tax behind the scenes, Exxon becomes the first major American energy company to move closer to the positions of European energy firms, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC, which have publicly advocated for a price on carbon.
Congress has made it clear it is unlikely to consider a carbon tax soon, especially under Republican control. But some in the energy industry believe a serious debate on additional climate measures isn't far off, especially if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins the White House in November.
The House vote in early June to condemn a carbon tax accentuated a widening rift within the industry over how, or whether, to engage on climate policy. The split is pitting smaller companies, especially domestic refiners, against multinational and European firms.
One senior U.S. oil executive said Exxon, like some other oil and gas companies, could also have a financial motive for supporting a carbon tax. Such a tax would make coal more expensive compared with natural gas. Exxon, beyond its oil business, is the U.S.'s largest natural-gas producer.
Mr. Jeffers, the Exxon spokesman, said his company has invested in gas in anticipation of climate policies that make coal more expensive.
Few, if any, U.S. companies other than Exxon have called for a carbon tax, and many oppose any plan designed to cut emissions. Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson, for example, is one of several outspoken opponents of a carbon tax.
Exxon's shift is unfolding against the backdrop of a landmark deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions struck by roughly 200 nations last December in Paris. Energy companies are also facing increasing pressure from federal regulators, and their own shareholders, to disclose potential business risks from the global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon shareholders in May narrowly voted down a resolution calling for a stress test to determine the risk that efforts to curb climate change pose to its business.
Exxon first publicly supported a carbon tax in 2009, presenting it as preferable to cap-and-trade, a market-based system for controlling carbon emissions that the Democratic-controlled Congress then appeared ready to enact. Cap-and-trade died in the Senate, the Republicans later captured Congress, and President Barack Obama has since pursued regulations to cut carbon emissions instead.
Some advocates of strong climate policy are skeptical Exxon's shift signals a deeper change. "We've seen so little movement out of any of their lobbying front groups," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.), who introduced a bill last summer to impose a carbon tax. The measure hasn't advanced in the Senate.
Mr. Whitehouse's staff recently met with Exxon lobbyists, but the senator said, "The meeting was more just an exploratory feeler to see about further conversations."

Full text:   Regarding Nicholas Wade's review of "Lysenko's Ghost" by Loren Graham ( , June 18): Russian agronomist Trofim Lysenko was the scourge of Soviet science for four decades as he "suppressed the study of genetics . . . in favor of his own belief that traits acquired during a plant's lifetime could be inherited." Comrade Lysenko's idea resonated with Soviet leaders who believed that government could mold Socialist Man and that acquired traits would be inherited by his offspring. Once the inheritability of acquired traits was deemed settled science in the U.S.S.R., scientists who disagreed were executed, sent to labor camps or fled into exile.
Lysenko's beliefs weren't completely wrong, but the purge of geneticists who challenged settled science dealt a blow to Soviet genetics research. Mr. Graham attributes the damage to two threats to the integrity of scientific inquiry: "institutional interference from without and political infection from within."
Kimberley Strassel's "Exxon's Inquisitors Feel the Heat" (Potomac Watch, June 17) comes to mind while considering the "ever-present" twin threats to science. Seventeen state attorneys general have filed suit against Exxon Mobil for defrauding the public by engaging in climate-change denial. A broad array of conservative groups that participate in the climate-change debate and fund climate research are targeted for scrutiny if they had any contact with Exxon in recent decades. The Exxon probe is a message to anyone daring to dispute the climate-change consensus. Government has too much riding on climate change with all of its implications for tax revenue and administrative-state power to permit dissent, and climate-change scientists have too much riding on government research funding. As government inquisitors move to shut off climate-change debate and punish heretics, it seems that Lysenko's ghost is now haunting the U.S.

Epigenetics was the settled science in leftist circles in its time. If our new crop of climate dissenters find their Siberian labor camps balmy and not frigid, then perhaps they'll concede the argument.

Exxon Mobil and CEI are attempting to argue that the First Amendment protects them from producing the information that can shed light on whether they broke the law -- a proposition the courts have routinely rejected. You write that the subpoena demanded CEI's "donor names" and "threatened its donors," but this is incorrect.
The CEI subpoena did not request the names of any donors or any information unrelated to Exxon. Its requests regarding funding are limited to funding directly or indirectly by Exxon, and only until 2007. Any suggestion that we have asked for anything akin to a list of current donors is simply false.

Full text:   Regarding Joe Colangelo's "A Devastating Threat We're Not Ready For" (op-ed, June 13): The electromagnetic-pulse threat (EMP) may indeed be the most serious imminent threat to our country. But the current administration, including the Energy Department, is much more concerned about the ethereal threat of climate change. That's where its attention and money are focused, to harden us against dubious man-made global warming, even though hardening power-generation plants at a relatively small cost seems like a no-brainer. Then again, without such plant upgrades, an EMP would be the quickest way for the administration to eliminate dependence on carbon-based fuels.

The EMP threat from the sun is real. In 1850 the battery-powered telegraph system in the U.S. suddenly burned out. Shortly before a treaty to ban above-ground nuclear detonations was to take effect, our military fired a missile with a hydrogen bomb warhead designed to destroy an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile from an island off the coast of Asia to high above the atmosphere. Its EMP damaged electric utility equipment thousands of miles away in Hawaii. Our military responded by requiring protection against EMP and testing of that protection in procurement of military systems. EMP from the sun might last a month and destroy unprotected electric grids around the world. An enemy missile with a hydrogen bomb warhead detonated far above the Earth's atmosphere could shut down electric grids from coast to coast in North America. Consequences would include no functioning pumps at gas stations, no working cash registers, no pumping of water out of reservoirs or pumping of natural gas or oil in pipelines, communications limited to word-of-mouth and hand-delivered notes and no functioning banks or governments.

Mr. Colangelo understates the threat by not including cyberattacks on the grid as potentially as devastating. It is incredible that a truly existential threat to our existence receives far less attention than global warming.

Full text:   Some of the U.S.'s most influential environmental groups are softening their longstanding opposition to nuclear power, marking a significant shift in the antinuclear movement as environmentalists' priority shifts to climate change.
The change is lowering one of the biggest political hurdles facing the nuclear power industry in the U.S. and comes at a critical time, as several financially struggling reactors are set to shut down.
"Because the historical context is that these groups were opposed to nuclear, their absence on the opposition front is noticed," said Joe Dominguez, executive vice president for governmental and regulatory affairs for Exelon Corp., the biggest owner of nuclear plants in the U.S. "I think it's pretty significant."
Nuclear power, which emits no greenhouse gases, provides about 20% of U.S. electricity and 60% of carbon-free electricity, according to federal data. Pressed by cheap natural gas and state policies that favor renewables over nuclear power, roughly a dozen reactors are either poised to shut down in the coming years or have already.
The Sierra Club, the country's oldest and largest environmental group, is debating whether to halt its longtime position in support of shuttering all existing nuclear-power plants earlier than required by their federal operating licenses.
The environmental group's leaders see existing reactors as a bridge to renewable electricity and an alternative source of energy as the group campaigns to close coal and natural gas plants.
The Environmental Defense Fund is similarly deciding to what extent it should adjust its policy, potentially lending its support to keeping open financially struggling reactors.
In Illinois, the Natural Resources Defense Council, along with the Sierra Club and EDF, are among the advocacy groups working with Exelon and state lawmakers on a legislative deal that would reverse a decision the company made in early June to close two nuclear reactors in the next two years.
The agreement would promote more energy efficiency and renewable energy while ensuring the reactors remain in operation by providing financial recognition for the zero-carbon electricity they produce.
The shift in attitude, Mr. Dominguez said, has a clear impact on energy companies' bottom line because it "allows for agreements on statewide policies, whereas before I didn't think we could get there."
Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, says his group is focusing most of its resources on closing coal plants and preventing the construction of new natural gas plants.
"We're actively debating the timeline in which nuclear plants should be decommissioned as we reduce our reliance on coal and gas in the electric sector," he said.
The shift is twofold. Some environmental groups that have in the past protested existing reactors are now at times staying on the sidelines. In other cases, such as the one in Illinois, environmentalists are working toward keeping reactors open.
Very few new nuclear plants, meanwhile, are set to come online soon because of market conditions, so the debate has focused largely on the fate of existing reactors. Most major environmental groups remain opposed to creating new nuclear plants, instead preferring renewable electricity.
Most environmentalists have long opposed nuclear power due to a host of concerns, including the risk of a catastrophic accident (a worry heightened by Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011), unresolved questions about radioactive waste storage, the potential for weapons proliferation from the fuel and a preference for renewable energy such as solar and wind.
In recent years, as climate change has climbed to the top of the agenda of nearly all major environmental groups, influential leaders in both the climate science and policy arenas have shifted positions.
Many now back this carbon-free source of energy, especially the existing fleet of approximately 100 reactors at about 60 power plants, which provide a steady source of electricity compared with the intermittence of wind and solar.
Michael Shellenberger, co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, a progressive think tank, founded an organization in January called Environmental Progress whose initial mission is focused on backing nuclear power to address climate change.
"If anything gives me hope in these dark times, it's that so many environmentalists are changing their minds about nuclear," said Mr. Shellenberger, who says he switched his position and began supporting nuclear power in 2011. "What was just a trickle of converters a few years ago has become a positive stampede."
Some environmental groups, including Greenpeace, continue to actively fight to close existing nuclear plants, saying the environmental risks, from radiation emissions to waste disposal, far outweigh any climate benefit. That is prompting these groups to oppose deals like the one in Illinois. "Illinois should not be bailing out old and dangerous nuclear reactors just because they can't compete," said Jim Riccio, nuclear policy analyst for Greenpeace.
After reactors, including two units of the San Onofre plant, closed in Southern California, and New England in 2013 and 2014, respectively, emissions in those regions rose after having declined for some time, according to data from nonprofit electricity transmission organizations. Regulators replaced those reactors with natural gas, which is often the cheapest option but emits carbon dioxide.
Mr. Dominguez cited a December announcement by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in favor of the continued operation of upstate nuclear plants as symbolizing the new mood. "I think that was a really significant turning point," he said.

Full text:   Exxon Mobil Corp. is seeking an injunction against the Massachusetts attorney general, alleging that a wide-ranging investigation into the oil company is politically motivated and violates its constitutional rights.
Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, wants to block a Massachusetts subpoena that sought documents relating to climate change science research and investor communications on the topic dating back 40 years. The company filed its motion on Wednesday in a federal court in the Northern District of Texas in Fort Worth.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey and U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Claude Walker are all investigating whether Exxon misrepresented its understanding of climate change to investors and the public. The company already has turned over hundreds of thousands of pages of documents to Mr. Schneiderman.
Exxon, in its court filing, called Ms. Healey's allegations "nothing more than a weak pretext for an unlawful exercise of government power to further political objectives."
Exxon also said that the subpoena violates its right to free speech, Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure and the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.
"Our investigation is based, not on speculation, but on inconsistencies about climate change in Exxon documents," Ms. Healey's office said.
The 33-page injunction filing is the company's most sharply worded rebuttal so far to investigations launched last year into what Exxon has known about climate change since the 1970s.
Republican lawmakers have criticized the probes by Democratic state attorneys general, a development that shows the degree to which the matter has become political football.
Exxon said the probes are "the culmination of years of planning," referring to a 2012 meeting in which environmental activists discussed using the subpoena power of attorneys general to obtain records.

Full text:   Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, dwelling less on her credentials for the job than on the need to stop Republican Donald Trump.
Mr. Brown, a popular governor who ran against Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential race, said he would vote for Mrs. Clinton in next Tuesday's California primary. He also praised her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying Mr. Sanders's focus on income inequality echoed his own message in the 1992 race.
In a statement, Mr. Brown recited the Democratic primary vote and delegate totals that have vaulted Mrs. Clinton to what he described as an "insurmountable" lead. Democrats, he wrote, have shown "that they want her as their nominee."
"This is no time for Democrats to keep fighting each other," Mr. Brown said. "The general election has already begun. Hillary Clinton, with her long experience, especially as secretary of state, has a firm grasp of the issues and will be prepared to lead our country on Day One."
Mr. Brown criticized Mr. Trump's positions on climate change, citing past comments in which Mr. Trump referred to global warming as a "hoax." He also faulted Mr. Trump for calling for the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and for saying that more allies should acquire nuclear weapons so that the U.S. doesn't have to shoulder so much of the cost.
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are competing hard in the June 7 primary in California. At stake are 475 delegates, the most of the 57 Democratic contests.
With Mr. Brown enjoying a high approval rating in the nation's largest state, his endorsement has the potential to make a difference.

Business News -- The Week Ahead: Airlines Look to Soothe Investors

Author: Wall, Robert; Cameron, Doug

Full text:   The airline industry has finally shaken off its boom-and-bust past, says the head of the world's largest carrier, but investors aren't buying it because familiar signs of trouble loom on the horizon.
Global airfares are falling as carriers add ever more aircraft, and low oil prices, which helped airlines land record profits of $33 billion last year, are edging higher.
Moreover, terrorism fears are weighing on bookings and, even as more passengers take to the skies, growth is stalling in some regions.
It is a challenging mix for the 200-plus airline executives gathering in Dublin this week for the industry's annual jamboree hosted by the International Air Transport Association, a trade group.
The message they would like to deliver echoes that of American Airlines Group Inc. Chief Executive Doug Parker in a well-publicized speech in March.
"We have an industry that also can be a real business like other businesses," said Mr. Parker, who has spearheaded much of the consolidation that has allowed airlines to become more efficient, and last year earn more than their cost of capital for the first time.
"The airline business has been fundamentally and structurally transformed and the valuations do not reflect such a transformation," he said. "They're not even close."
Investors have shrugged and headed for the exits, dragging an index of global airline stocks down 6.4% since the start of the year.
U.S. carriers have been hit hardest, with Mr. Parker's American shedding a quarter of its value even as it poured profits into stock buybacks.
Demand isn't the problem. Global passenger numbers rose 7% in the first quarter from a year earlier, driven largely by growth among carriers in Asia and the Middle East.
Fliers are paying less, with global fares down an average 4% through April and particularly weak on trans-Atlantic flights and in the U.S.
Average U.S. domestic fares haven't risen in more than a year and airlines don't expect them to stabilize before the end of 2016.
Hunter Keay, airline analyst at Wolfe Research LLC, last week boosted his airline investor-sentiment gauge to 4, on a scale of 1 to 10, having pegged it at 1 or 2 for much of the year. "This is the 2016 version of good news, sadly," he said of the recent raise.
The executives gathered in Dublin have few levers to pull to soothe disgruntled investors or those passengers facing long security lines at airports in coming months.
Airlines can cut flights to gain more control over fares. Some U.S. carriers such as Delta Air Lines Inc. recently have announced plans to trim capacity after the Labor Day holiday in September. In Europe, British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA and Deutsche Lufthansa AG also has scaled back.
Executives have to be careful in Dublin. Antitrust laws bar them from discussing or coordinating fares in most markets. Comments made at last year's IATA meeting in Miami form part of a class-action lawsuit lodged against four U.S. carriers. All deny the charges.
Cheaper jet fuel has been the biggest driver of higher profits, but prices have been rising since January.
Still, the airline industry should deliver strong earnings this year, said Peter Morris, chief economist at aviation consultant Ascend Worldwide Ltd.
Many carriers in Europe and Asia are only starting to see the benefit from cheaper fuel as costly fuel hedges, made before crude tumbled, are replaced by ones made at more favorable rates.
"There have been a number of negative developments that have come up, but they don't override the underlying achievement for profitability," Mr. Morris said.
Also on the Dublin agenda is the prospect of a new cost headwind as regulators consider making carriers pay for carbon-dioxide emissions.
Airlines are exempt from the global climate change deal struck in Paris last December, but pressure has been mounting on politicians and regulators to curtail the CO2 output from commercial flights.
Environmental groups fret that the airline industry's rapid growth could undermine other climate-change initiatives unless limits are imposed.
The International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations, is trying to secure agreement on a mechanism to limit the industry's C02 output without curtailing growth.
ICAO members pledged to improve the fuel efficiency of commercial aircraft by 2% a year and to see that any industry growth beyond 2020 won't increase pollution.
ICAO representatives convened in May to help bridge differences between member states about what the system might look like.
Exactly how much of an airline's carbon emissions will need to be offset is still being negotiated. IATA estimates that the airline industry's annual bill would be about $2.8 billion compared with projected profits this year of $36 billion, a forecast expected to be updated this week.

Full text:   BISMARCK, N.D. -- Donald Trump on Thursday secured the delegates he needs to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee, and immediately showed what an unpredictable general-election candidate he will be.
In a rollicking news conference before delivering an energy-policy speech here, Mr. Trump bashed his political opponents -- both Democratic and Republican -- but began hedging on key issues that powered his primary campaign.
The New York businessman dialed back support for one of his most controversial proposals -- imposing a temporary ban on allowing Muslims into the U.S. -- and softened his once-unconditional support for federal subsidies for ethanol that are key to corn farmers in Iowa. He also said he still plans to release his tax returns, after declaring them none of the public's business.
Mr. Trump again mockingly called Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is emerging as a chief Democratic protagonist, "Pocahontas" because of her past claim to Native American heritage.
"I think she is as Native American as I am. OK? That I will tell you. But she's a woman that's been very ineffective other than she's got a big mouth," Mr. Trump said.
When he called her Pocahontas, Nicole Robertson, a Cree Indian who works as a reporter, called out "very offensive." He responded, "Is it offensive? You tell me. Oh, I'm sorry about that," he said.
Ms. Warren, who called Mr. Trump a "small, insecure money grubber" in a speech Tuesday, said Wednesday that he can "fling as much mud" as he wants but she won't back down.
The exchange underscored the unprecedented nature of his first-time candidacy, and signaled that the 2016 election season is likely to remain on its uncharted course through November's general election despite calls from some Republicans for him to be more statesmanlike.
Mr. Trump taunted his chief Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, for enduring a longer primary fight than he did, and reupped an invitation to her primary opponent -- Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- to debate him, but only if he or television networks produces a $10 million charitable donation.
The presumptive GOP presidential nominee spoke to reporters while standing before most of the 21-member North Dakota delegation to the Republican National Convention, including John Trandem, a Fargo-area antiabortion activist who the Associated Press reported Thursday became the 1,237th GOP delegate to back his candidacy, putting him over the top.
Mr. Trandem, like many of the state's delegates, had previously backed Mr. Trump's former rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. North Dakota's delegates are free to change their allegiance at any time.
The GOP standard-bearer refused to back off his criticism of the job being done by New Mexico's Republican governor, Susana Martinez, who has yet to endorse him. But he did receive an olive branch from one of his other former rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
"I want to be helpful," Mr. Rubio said in a CNN interview, offering to make appearances for Mr. Trump. "I don't want to be harmful because I don't want Hillary Clinton to be president."
As the party continues to coalesce around his candidacy, Mr. Trump is repositioning himself for the fall general election. He declined to repeat his past call for a ban on Muslims entering the country, a proposal he offered in December five days after a husband-and-wife team shot 14 people at a holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., an act of terrorism that many believe was fueled by their interpretation of their Islamic faith.
At that time, Mr. Trump called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on" -- a proposal that remains on his campaign website.
But Mr. Trump called that pledge "a suggestion" during a Fox News interview earlier this month. On Thursday, he dodged the question. "We're going to look at a lot of different things," Mr. Trump said. "We have to be vigilant and we have to be tough and smart."
Asked a second time if he still supported the Muslim-entry ban, Mr. Trump replied: "As of this moment I am very unhappy when I look at the world of radical Islam." He added: "We're going to come up with a solution."
On ethanol, Mr. Trump also hedged his once-strident support of federal protections for the corn ethanol industry. In January -- ahead of the Iowa caucuses -- he used that issue as a cudgel to attack Mr. Cruz, who called for phasing out the Renewable Fuel Standard.
Mr. Trump said he would have to discuss the issue with Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a staunch supporter of the program, saying "we're going to look at" whether he will continue to back the federal ethanol mandate.
Mr. Trump used his energy speech, delivered to attendees at an oil conference in the heart of the U.S. oil boom, to lay out an expansive policy that encourages production of fossil fuels, repeals a raft of Obama administration environmental rules and pulls the U.S. from a global agreement to address climate change.
Mr. Trump didn't lay out many new policy proposals, but instead focused more on broader promises aimed at making the nation energy independent and prioritizing U.S. workers over foreign ones. Reading from a teleprompter, he also renewed his call for a wall on the Mexican border and limiting trade alliances.
Environmentalists panned Mr. Trump's speech, describing it as a wish list for fossil fuels. The speech "reads like a love letter to big corporate polluters and a Dear John letter to our future," said Tom Steyer, a hedge fund billionaire turned climate activist who leads NextGen Climate, an advocacy group.

Full text:   Shareholders at Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. narrowly voted down resolutions calling for stress tests to determine the risk that efforts to curb climate change pose to their businesses.
Despite the defeat, the proposals drew more support than any contested climate-related votes in the history of the two biggest U.S. oil and gas companies.
Preliminary results showed 41% support from Chevron investors that cast ballots and 38% support at Exxon, an indication that more mainstream shareholders such as pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds and asset managers are starting to take more seriously the threat of a global weaning from fossil fuels.
The number of shareholders supporting the climate-risk measures "is significant, and it will continue to grow," said Beth Richtman, investment manager at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which manages about $290 billion. Calpers owns about $1 billion worth of Exxon shares and approximately $600 million in Chevron stock.
"There's a groundswell of share owners who are going to keep pushing this forward," she said. "We need to see them rise to the realm of best practices in terms of climate risk reporting, and we're not there yet."
While the shareholder votes aren't binding, supporters of the measures declared victory even in defeat after the oil companies' annual shareholder meetings Wednesday.
"You have to read this as a shot across the bow of the industry," said Andrew Logan, director of the oil and gas program at Ceres, a Boston-based nonprofit group that advocated for the proposals.
Exxon and Chevron had fought to keep the measures off the ballot, a push that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rebuffed.
Separately on Wednesday, the White House said it planned to propose a new rule that companies with federal contracts must disclose whether they share information about the risks that a changing climate could pose to their operations, as well as their goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
That rule, expected to be completed this fall, would affect most federal contracts. The U.S. government is a major buyer of oil products, including jet fuel and diesel used by the military.
Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said Wednesday the company includes in its energy outlook a proxy cost on carbon.
"It's really the only way we know to accommodate in our financial decision-making the impacts of future policies that are yet to be formulated," he said. He added that most Exxon projects are either too short-term or too large for the theoretical cost of carbon they use in planning purposes to affect their decision-making.
Exxon has also noted it published a 2014 report on managing climate risks that said none of the company's oil and gas holdings are threatened by a global push to reduce carbon emissions.
Chevron told investors that the proposed climate measure was flawed. Efforts to limit warming could allow some energy producers, such as those who sell natural gas, to benefit while others fall out of favor, including coal-mining companies, Chevron said. The company is a large producer of natural gas and factors in a theoretical future price of carbon when deciding which projects to sanction, making a stress test unnecessary, the company said.
"We don't think this proposal will advance our thinking," Chevron Chief Executive John Watson said Wednesday.
Measures of this sort have been pushed in prior years by environmental groups and activist investors, but now more traditional shareholders are putting their muscle behind the proposals.
Those who led the filing of the Exxon resolution were the Church Commissioners for England and the New York State Common Retirement Fund, along with others. The lead filers for the Chevron resolution were Hermes Equity Ownership Services and Wespath Investment Management, a division of the United Methodist Church.
Investors representing more than $10 trillion in assets pledged to support the climate proxy measures, which assert that Exxon, Chevron and other big oil companies should be transparent about how their drilling prospects would suffer if the world turned away from carbon-intensive fuels, including crude oil.

Full text:   SAN RAMON, Calif. -- Chevron Corp. Chief Executive John Watson has a blunt message for investors, climate activists and anyone else listening: Fossil fuels aren't going away.
But this stance increasingly sets him apart from his oil counterparts as they react to pressure from climate-change activists and concerned shareholders.
On Wednesday, Chevron, like Exxon Mobil Corp., is facing a shareholder-proposal campaign by activists who want the company to detail the risk climate change poses to its business. Exxon is opposed to the proposal, and so is Mr. Watson: He questions its entire premise, arguing that climate change might even prove positive for Chevron, if it spurs more of the planet to shift from coal to natural gas.
"I hope to gain market share in some areas," he said.
Where many other oil and gas executives are retreating at least in rhetoric, emphasizing common ground with environmentalists, Mr. Watson, who became CEO in 2010, has doubled down.
Some of Chevron's biggest rivals, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Exxon, and BP PLC, have embraced some form ofa price on carbon -- a system that generally taxes polluters, which then pass the costs onto consumers and can lower demand. Several companies have also made new forays into renewable energy or emission-reduction technology.
Shell's CEO on Tuesday aligned himself with those pressing for a major response to climate changeduring the company's annual meeting.
"We believe absolutely that climate change is real. Not all oil companies do that," Shell CEOBen van Beurden told investors.
Mr. Watson, 59 years old, isn't a climate-change skeptic. But the staunch disciple of free markets believes that only a major technological breakthrough, rather than a top-down solution from government, will substantially curb climate change.
While nearly 200 countries agreed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in Paris last year, Mr. Watson doubts they will achieve their goals.
"You can sign agreements in Paris, that's a good step," he said. "But when you sign agreements and create the impression that it's going to be implemented when no one's identified the trillions of dollars that it's going to cost, it's just not clear that's going to deliver."
Shell, BP and ConocoPhillips have welcomed the idea of making additional disclosures about the risk climate change poses to their business.
The companies have released additional information, such as their outlook for how much global oil demand will fall if the Paris goals are met. But it has fallen short of what some investor groups want: a detailed discussion of how specific company assets may decline in value if more stringent policies are adopted to reduce global emissions.
Chevron is resisting such proposals,but notes that it already considers a potential price on carbon when planning projects.

Full text:   Regarding Robert Bryce's "An Ill Wind: Open Season on Bald Eagles" (op-ed, May 16): Wind power is one of the best ways to protect eagles and other birds because it combats their biggest threat -- climate change.
Wind energy has the lowest impact on wildlife and its habitats of any source of energy, as detailed in a 2009 study by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, which analyzed the life-cycle impacts of the six major forms of energy generation. The report concluded, "nonrenewable electricity generation sources, such as coal and oil, pose higher risks to wildlife than renewable electricity generation sources, such as hydro and wind."
Misplaced concern over the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's new proposal risks overshadowing larger threats such as climate change. The National Audubon Society points out that climate change is putting more than 300 different North American bird species at risk, not just eagles. As an emission-free energy source, wind power helps reduce this threat.

The Obama Fish & Wildlife Service has recently granted every windmill farm in America the privilege of killing up to 4,200 eagles a year for 30 years. This demonstrates the priorities of the liberals. In the 1970s they pushed to outlaw DDT world-wide because DDT harmed the eggs of eagles and other birds. As a result, the mosquito population increased exponentially, spreading malaria and killing millions of Africans and South Americans in warm, humid areas of the globe. Now, eagles will take a back seat to the global-warming scare so that liberals can increase government intrusion into our lives, not to mention increasing our utility bills drastically. In short, sacrifice humans for birds but sacrifice birds for government control.

If only the California delta smelt had wings and could fly. Then every wind turbine in the U.S. would be mothballed overnight. No new permits would be allowed and wind farms would be as unwelcome as a coal mine. This is just more proof of how morally bankrupt the Fish and Wildlife Service and "environmentalists" truly are.

Let us imagine, if it could be proven, that nuclear power plants were killing over 4,000 bald eagles every year. We would be hearing calls to immediately shut down all our nuclear power plants and give up on nuclear power for all time. Yet the same people who seek to ban nuclear power, coal and fracking for natural gas want to give windmills a free pass on killing endangered birds.

This hypocrisy should stun no one who soberly assesses an agenda-driven administration that will stop at absolutely nothing to destroy the basic American principles of individual rights and freedom from an oppressive government. Wind turbines are clubbing eagles to death. The metaphor couldn't be clearer.

Full text:   NEW DELHI -- India's government is weighing a proposal by Apple Inc. to refurbish and sell secondhand iPhones in the country, officials said, as the tech giant tries to gain traction in a fast-growing and populous, but not very affluent, market.
Success in new markets like India will be central to the Cupertino, Calif., company's expansion, analysts said. Apple last week reported its first quarterly revenue decline since 2003 amid falling sales of its smartphones in China.
In India, however, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts that iPhone sales jumped 56% in the three months ended March 26 from the same period a year earlier. Apple's market share for smartphones in the country remains small at roughly 2%.
Used phones would let Apple offer a less-expensive product in a country where 70% of smartphones sold last year cost less than $150. IPhones, by comparison, typically cost $500 to $1,000 without a data plan in India.
"The target consumer in India is still looking for more value for money" and have many other cheaper models to choose from, said Rushabh Doshi, an analyst at research firm Canalys in Singapore.
Apple sells refurbished devices, which have been repaired or had parts replaced, in many countries, including the U.S. In some countries, it also offers what it calls certified preowned products, which contain a mix of new and reused components.
In India, the company has applied to make and sell certified preowned iPhones, according to government officials. Apple is seeking permission to import preowned phones and to refurbish them in India.
"We are looking into the issues related to Apple's proposal," a senior official in the Prime Minister's Office said Wednesday. The official, who declined to be named, said the country was concerned about ending up with potentially hazardous electronic waste.
Apple declined to comment on concerns that its products might generate hazardous electronic waste. In its most recent environment report, Apple said it "disposes of hazardous waste responsibly."
Prakash Javadekar, India's minister for environment, forest and climate change, said his agency was evaluating Apple's plan, as did an official who declined to be named at India's Telecom Ministry, which oversees policies related to the electronics industry.
Pardeep Jain, managing director of smartphone maker Karbonn Mobile India Pvt., an Apple rival, said he wasn't opposed to Apple's proposal, since he believes most consumers in India prefer new phones and don't want to buy used phones. Newton, Mass.-based research firm Strategy Analytics projects some 149 million smartphones will be sold in India this year, up 26% from last year. India is expected to overtake the U.S. in smartphone sales next year, which would make it second only to China.
Price is a big challenge for Apple in India, where average per capita income is about $1,500 a year. Apple's new iPhone SE, its cheapest-ever handset, typically costs more than $500 in India. The best-selling iPhone model in India is now the older iPhone 5S model, which costs about $300 and accounted for some 50% of sales in the first quarter, said Tarun Pathak, a Delhi-based analyst with Counterpoint.
The iPhone SE is intended to replace the 5S. Mr. Pathak said that will leave Indian consumers with only pricier models.
Used or refurbished devices, if allowed in India, could help Apple fill the gap at the low end, he said. Apple in recent months has lowered prices in India, ramped up advertising and expanded its distribution network to get devices into smaller towns and cities.

Prime Minister Agrees
To Panama Probe
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in a televised address that he would ask the Supreme Court to assemble a commission of sitting judges to investigate his assets, bowing to opposition demands in the wake of the Panama Papers leak.
Documents included in the massive leak early this month showed that his children owned offshore companies set up by a Panamanian law firm. Mr. Sharif has denied wrongdoing by himself or his family.
He had earlier offered to form a panel of retired judges.
The powerful military, which has historically been locked in a power struggle with the prime minister's officer, has also weighed in, saying the nation's war with extremists can't be won "unless the menace of corruption is . . . uprooted."

MIDDLE EAST
U.S. Raises Death Toll
From Airstrikes to 41
U.S. military officials said nine American airstrikes in Iraq and Syria likely killed 20 civilians, bringing the total number of civilians the U.S. has acknowledged to have killed during its campaign against Islamic State to 41.
U.S. Central Command officials confirmed that nine separate strikes between Sept. 10 and Feb. 2 "likely resulted" in the deaths of 20 civilians and the injuries of 11 more.
The U.S. is the only member of the coalition fighting Islamic State to release a targeted tally of likely civilian deaths during the 20-month air campaign.
Nongovernmental groups that track civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria say the actual number of casualties due to U.S. airstrikes is likely far higher.

UNITED NATIONS
Climate Deal Signed
World leaders gathered at the United Nations to sign a landmark agreement on climate change, setting in motion a process to curb the impact of global warming.
The so-called Paris Agreement, brokered at a conference in Paris last fall, was signed by 175 countries in what the U.N. said was the largest number of nations ever to sign an international document in a single day. However, it is now up to individual countries to ratify the agreement to make it legally binding.
Many countries, including France, the U.S. and Canada, pledged to ratify the deal by the end of the year. A key goal is to have 55 nations responsible for 55% of carbon emissions ratify the deal.

Full text:   Exxon Mobil Corp. went to court Wednesday to challenge a government investigation of whether the company conspired to cover up its understanding of climate change, a sign the energy company is gearing up for a drawn-out legal battle with environmentalists and officials on the politically charged issue.
The company filed court papers in Texas seeking to block a subpoena issued in March by the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands, one of several government officials pursuing Exxon. Wednesday's filing argues that the subpoena is an unwarranted fishing expedition into Exxon's internal records that violates its constitutional rights.
"The chilling effect of this inquiry, which discriminates based on viewpoint to target one side of an ongoing policy debate, strikes at protected speech at the core of the First Amendment," the filing says.
Exxon also dismisses the notion that there is any suggestion of a crime, saying Attorney General Claude Earl Walker "issued the subpoena without the reasonable suspicion required by law and based on an ulterior motive to silence those who express views on climate change with which they disagree."
A request for comment to the U.S. Virgin Islands' attorney general's office wasn't immediately returned.
In the subpoena, the U.S. Virgin Islands told Exxon it could be violating two state laws, by purportedly obtaining money under false pretenses and conspiring to do so.
Both sides see this as a pivotal moment in a growing campaign by environmentalists to deploy a legal strategy used against tobacco companies in the 1990s by arguing that oil companies have long hidden what they know about climate change. Tobacco firms' finances and credibility were badly damaged by lawsuits accusing them of hiding the truth about their products.
A key meeting in the new push unfolded in January behind closed doors at a Manhattan office building. The session brought together about a dozen people, including Kenny Bruno, a veteran of environmental campaigns, and Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, two activists who helped lead the successful fight to block the Keystone XL pipeline.
The new campaign's goals include "to establish in public's mind that Exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity (and all creation) toward climate chaos and grave harm," according to an agenda of the meeting viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
This new legal strategy stems in part from environmentalists' frustration at what they see as the inadequacy of recent climate deals. Their hope is to encourage state attorneys general and the U.S. Justice Department to launch investigations and lawsuits that ultimately will change Exxon's behavior, force it to pay big damages and drive public attention to climate change.
"It's about helping the larger public understand the urgencies of finding climate solutions," said Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, which hosted the January meeting. "It's not really about Exxon."
Exxon and its supporters dismiss the comparison with tobacco. Cigarettes are a harmful, addictive product used by a portion of the public, they say, while fossil fuels are fundamental to the world economy.
In Wednesday's filing, Exxon's lawyers say the company has confirmed for more than a decade that it sees the risks of climate change, and has publicly advocated for a carbon tax as the best way to regulate carbon emissions.
A key part of the activists' strategy is to seek documents that show otherwise: that Exxon, despite knowing the dangers of climate change, has sought to challenge the scientific consensus. Such revelations would help "delegitimize [Exxon] as a political actor," the January agenda said.
In a twist, the initiative is set to be bankrolled partly by the heirs of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Exxon's forebear, Standard Oil. The Rockefeller Family Fund has signaled it will help fund the campaign through its existing backing of 350.org, though it hasn't provided a figure.
Wednesday's filing is Exxon's first legal salvo in what could be a long war, since at least four state attorneys general have launched investigations and a dozen others have signaled they might.
None has been as aggressive as New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who subpoenaed Exxon in November seeking data about the company's research on climate change over several decades. Exxon hasn't challenged that subpoena, partly because a New York law called the Martin Act gives Mr. Schneiderman wide latitude to investigate businesses for possible fraud or misrepresentation.
The new legal theory has yet to gain momentum within the Justice Department, according to officials familiar with internal discussions. But after prodding by lawmakers, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting a preliminary review.
The issue also has seeped into the political arena. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has called for an investigation of Exxon, and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.), pressed U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the matter at a recent congressional hearing.
The activists are focusing on Exxon documents that have surfaced in news outlets -- including in publications or investigative projects that were funded partly by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Rockefeller Family Fund, which favor strong climate action. The media outlets involved -- the Los Angeles Times and InsideClimate News -- have said the reporting was done without influence by the funding sources.
The activists' biggest challenge may be to establish clear culpability for global warming. Millions of individuals contribute with their use of fossil fuels, while national governments have done little despite knowing the risks, said David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan law professor and former federal environmental crimes prosecutor.
"Exxon should have been far more forthright about the risks associated with climate change, but all of us are culpable for our collective failure to change," Mr. Uhlmann said. "The likelihood that these investigations will lead to significant damages are small."
But Sharon Eubanks, who led the tobacco litigation during the Clinton and Bush administrations and attended the January meeting, said she believes a lawsuit by the government against Exxon is viable under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. RICO allows the government to pursue civil lawsuits against a people or entities working in concert to violate the law.

Full text:   In his April 7 op-ed "An Overheated Climate Alarm" Bjorn Lomborg targets the recent Federal Climate and Health Assessment, focusing on the balance between cold-related deaths avoided and heat-related deaths caused by climate change. He complains that the report "not once" mentions that more people die of cold than heat -- a complaint that is plainly false (see the chapter on temperature). Mr. Lomborg is right that cold-related deaths will decline, but quantitatively comparing this health benefit with the health penalties of hotter weather and more heat waves is complex, as the report clearly acknowledges.
More important, Mr. Lomborg misses the forest by arguing about just one tree. Heat is just one of many exposures by which climate change threatens human health. Severe storm events kill and displace people. Insect-borne disease risk spreads, as warming allows West Nile or Zika-carrying mosquitoes and Lyme-ridden ticks to expand their range. Nutrition is threatened as the nutrient content of crops decreases and changes in weather threaten our breadbasket. Heat and stagnant air masses threaten respiratory health from ozone (smog) pollution.
Fortunately, the solutions to climate change are also public health prescriptions: clean sources of energy, such as the ever-cheaper wind and solar; active transportation such as walking, cycling, transit and urban green spaces.
There's no place for selective, gratuitous contrarianism in assessing the science of climate change. Any fair reading of the growing body of evidence -- nicely summarized in the federal report -- makes clear that climate change is a pressing health concern, and that both adaptation and mitigation must be urgent priorities.

Longevity in both cold North Dakota and Hawaii top the list in the U.S. Canadians above the 49th parallel live longer than Americans: 81 years versus 78.7 years. Moving to a warmer spot like Texas and Florida may be fine for moneyed retirees, but for the rest of the world's population it's often impractical. Syria's refugees would happily live out their lives in Norway or Germany, and longevity for them would have little to do with the local weather.
Global warming will still have deleterious effects on the world's coastlines, air quality, water supplies and agriculture -- those are the biggies.

Full text:   Weaning the world off coal, doubling down on renewables and investing in breakthrough technologies that can help stop climate change were hotly debated topics last week at The Wall Street Journal's ECO:nomics conference in Santa Barbara, Calif.
At the annual gathering, environmentalists and energy experts sparred over lofty environmental goals as well as the current realities of fossil-fuel demand. Can natural gas replace enough coal-fired power generation to clear the air of carbon emissions? The Sierra Club's Michael Brune thinks not.
Energy banker Jeffrey Holzschuh of Morgan Stanley predicted solar power will overtake wind. But he warned that better battery storage of electricity is needed to truly cement green power in the U.S. energy mix.
Koch Industries defended its environmental record. And U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that while the Paris climate talks held in December were flawed, they were the best outcome that could be hoped for and a necessary step toward combating the top threat to humanity. "This is not the end," he said. "This is the beginning."

Full text:   Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse complains (Letters, April 7) that the Journal misrepresents his views. He says, "I welcome an informed debate about how to address one of the most pressing global challenges of our time." In other words, the only permissible subject is what to do about this alleged problem. Furthermore, only "informed" debate is permitted, which I assume means debate containing opinions the senator approves of. This makes it clear that debate about other subjects -- for example, whether the alleged problem exists at all, or whether it is caused by human activity -- is not permissible topics for discussion. This is exactly what the Journal has been saying all along.

Sen. Whitehouse's comparison of the fossil-fuel industry to the tobacco industry is silly. Energy is a modern necessity that virtually every human relies on, and fossil fuels are the only feasible means to satisfy the demand in the foreseeable future. Tobacco is a luxury good whose outright ban would have little effect on society.
The "more people than ever" who "think climate change is a serious threat in their lifetime" may say that in a Gallup poll, but how do they behave? Are they moving inland, causing coastal real-estate markets to collapse? Trading in their pickup trucks for Chevy Volts? Buying so many solar panels that panel manufacturing moves back from China? People vote with their pocketbooks for what they truly believe every day.

If Sen. Whitehouse is concerned about conspiracy and fraud in climate science, he should look at the "Climategate" emails. Here he will find climate alarmists conspiring to punish any scientific journal editor who dares to publish anything that contradicts their views and collectively agreeing to favorably review each other's papers regardless of their worth.

Full text:   Your editorial "'Standing Up to the WSJ'" (April 2) begins: "Politicians are endlessly inventive." If only we were as inventive as the Journal editorial board!
It's amusing to see the Journal claim the public isn't persuaded by the evidence of climate change. To the contrary, and notwithstanding the editorial efforts of the Journal, the public is convinced of the realities of climate change. Just a few weeks ago, Gallup reported 65% of Americans understand that climate change is caused by human activity. That's an all-time high for Gallup. It also showed more people than ever think climate change is a serious threat in their lifetime.
You accuse me of raising money off my email rebutting past Journal arguments. Not true. There was no donate button, no call to visit my website, no solicitation of any kind. I was responding to misleading claims made about me to my supporters.
And as it has done in the past, the Journal once again ascribes motivation that I simply don't have -- that I'm out to "punish those who disagree with [me]." On the contrary, I welcome an informed debate about how to address one of the most pressing global challenges of our time, which the Journal has repeatedly denied even exists. Disagreeing with me isn't the culpable conduct; outright fraud is. If there is a coordinated and fraudulent campaign by industry to mislead the public on the harms of its product -- like the tobacco industry's efforts with smoking -- an investigation to determine that fact is warranted.
This fuss smacks of desperation on the Journal's part. Perhaps its beloved fossil-fuel industry seems less defensible these days.

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- Regulators around the globe are researching potential risks to financial stability from a failure to contain climate change or a sudden collapse in the value of fossil-fuel assets.
Institutions such as the Bank of England, Financial Stability Board and European Systemic Risk Board are examining how banks, insurers and pension funds would cope if policies designed to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions led to a sharp drop in the share price of oil, gas and coal companies.
They are looking at new rules to disclose exposures to both stocks and bonds in such companies, conducting "stress tests" based on different climate scenarios or even requiring additional capital buffers.
The regulators' concerns rest on scientific assessments that much of the world's known fossil-fuel reserves would have to stay underground if governments want to limit global warming to two-degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
If they aim to contain average temperature increases to 1.5 degrees, as set out in an international climate deal sealed in Paris in December, the carbon budget would shrink even more.
That has triggered fears that a poorly managed switch to less-polluting energy sources, such as solar or wind power, could cause selloffs of fossil-fuel companies and broader economic problems caused by energy shortages.
"A wholesale reassessment of prospects, especially if it were to occur suddenly, could potentially destabilize markets, spark a procyclical crystallization of losses and a persistent tightening of financial conditions," Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said in a recent speech.
Mr. Carney, who also presides over the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors risk in the global financial system, has emerged as one of the leading voices in the debate on climate risk. Last year, the Group of 20 major economies asked the FSB to scope out potential vulnerabilities in the financial system linked to climate change.
In response, the FSB set up an industry task force that is working out standards for companies to disclose their exposure to climate risks. Its first report will be published Friday.
"If we don't get the policy environment right today, it won't just be the shareholder of insurance companies and banks who will regret this," said Steve Waygood, chief responsible-investment officer at the investment arm of U.K. insurer Aviva PLC and one of the task force's members.
Because there are no unified disclosure rules, it is difficult to put a number on financial companies' exposures to carbon-heavy assets -- and the risks associated with them. Estimates used by the European Systemic Risk Board suggest that banks, pension funds and insurers based in the European Union hold more than 1 trillion euros (about $1.13 trillion) in equity and debt of fossil-fuel companies and that major stock indexes could fall as much as 20% if assets are revalued in line with a two-degree scenario.

Trump, Cruz Call for
U-Turn on Regulation
The energy and environment agendas of leading Republican candidates for president would lead to the unwinding of nearly everything President Barack Obama has done in that realm over the past eight years, according to answers they offered in a survey released Wednesday.
Businessman Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered some of their most detailed views when responding to a series of questions posed by the American Energy Alliance, a conservative interest group.
Their answers were similar in most instances: They called for the review and possibly elimination of most environmental regulations and opposed a carbon tax. Both said they would review a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency finding that climate change endangers public health and welfare -- a conclusion that underpins Mr. Obama's entire regulatory agenda to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

AFTER THE CAMPAIGN
Jeb Bush Available
For Paid Speeches
Jeb Bush is back on the speaking circuit. The Washington Speakers Bureau said Wednesday it will be once again "exclusively" representing the former presidential candidate and governor of Florida.
Mr. Bush left the race in February, unable to shake rival Donald Trump's disparagement of him as "low energy." He reported last year earning nearly $10 million in speaking fees since 2007, receiving as much as $40,000 a speech in the U.S. and as much as $75,000 overseas.

Full text:   Regarding David B. Rivkin Jr. and Andrew M. Grossman's "Punishing Climate-Change Skeptics" (op-ed, March 24): The shift by global-warming alarmists to criminalize dissent dramatizes how soundly they are losing the battle. They long ago lost the battle for public support, with global warming ranking near or at the bottom of national surveys of voters' concerns.
Surveys of climate scientists, even those heavily biased in favor of climate alarmism, find extensive disagreement on the underlying science and doubts about its reliability. The indisputable fact remains that the science isn't settled about the causes, effects and severity of global warming. And skeptical scientists must be free from threat of criminal prosecution to continue their search for answers and solutions.

Current moves to brand global-warming skeptics as "heretics" reaffirms that this isn't about science, but rather a secular religion that serves a most unholy alliance of interest groups. The foundation of true science is constant doubt and an unwavering commitment to the empirical process of discovery. In contrast, religions have historically been founded on a system of unquestioned belief, control, disregard for compliant nonbelievers and the persecution of outright heretics. The global-warming cause celebre thus mimics in a tidy technological package the religious precepts of guilt (I carbonize), penance (I submit to government supervision and taxes) and absolution (I am redeemed as "green"). As such, the doctrine is well-suited for recruitment among the primarily urban intellectuals who eschew traditional religion but still hunger for redemption.
America was formed on a basic premise of the separation of church and state, but the climate religion blends the two together.

The Catholic Church opposed and suppressed Galileo Galilei to preserve its worldview and power. Today, fossil-fuel industry spokesmen and market fundamentalists oppose and suppress climate-change science to preserve their worldview and power. Galileo was eventually vindicated by history; evidence and logic overcame entrenched self-interest. Climate scientists -- not climate skeptics -- are more analogous to heroic heretics in their battles with deeply rooted self-interest.

Whatever compels the closed minds of elites who should know better, one doesn't have to go back to Galileo's persecution to find reason for humility. Recall during the eugenics movement of the early 20th century the castigation of dissenters: Teddy Roosevelt saw deniers as fostering "race suicide," Margaret Sanger fretted over the production of "human weeds" and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes opined that "three generations of imbeciles are enough." World leaders were self-assured about eugenics until Hitler gave them pause.

Full text:   The Journal editorial page regularly sides with right-wing, climate denial outfits in claiming that I want to prosecute dissent on climate change ("Plenty of Climate $hange," Review & Outlook, March 16). I do not. I can't help noting that on the same page as the editorial on me, you ran yet another letter from the Heartland Institute, famous for equating climate scientists with the Unabomber.
Let me be clear. My belief is that there are sufficient similarities between the tobacco industry's fraudulent denial of its products' health effects and the fossil fuel industry's denial of its products' climate and oceans effects, that a proper inquiry should be made about pursuing a civil action like the one the Justice Department brought and won against tobacco. I would expect such an inquiry to be made by the Civil Division, and my questions to the attorney general were to explore whether assignment of this matter to the FBI was a bureaucratic "punt" to the wrong section of the department. Trying to saddle me with an argument I am not making is no way to convince anyone that the argument I am making is wrong.

If people who don't believe mankind causes climate change could be prosecuted (and fined and jailed?), does that mean people who don't believe in God could be prosecuted (and perhaps burned at the stake)? Conversely, if atheists take over our government, could believers be prosecuted (and fined and shunned)?
Branding climate skeptics as anything other than climate skeptics is balderdash. Suggesting they be investigated or prosecuted is ludicrous, stupid and medieval, as well as totally un-American. Or does the First Amendment not protect scientific inquiry?

I've had a 30-plus-year career in oceanography. In 2014 I was in Washington, D.C., as a member of the leadership council of an academic oceanographic consortium which Sen. Whitehouse addressed. He gave what amounted to a sneering, partisan dismissal of anyone who might read the climate data differently from the prevailing administration position. He specifically called out Republicans for ridicule. At the end of his comments, during a Q&A session, I calmly and politely reminded him that not everyone present marches in lockstep with the Democratic Party's position on global warming, and that his ridicule for Republicans would do nothing other than poison the possibility of reasoned dialogue.
What was revealing was the climate of fear in the room among the half dozen or so who came up to me later to whisper their gratitude for my speaking out in response to Sen. Whitehouse. They have jobs at stake; I am retired. None wanted to publicly be seen or heard confronting him. The senator has been a strong supporter of ocean-science research, helping to ensure that the spigot of federal money remains open to investigators and their institutions. Grant recipients are either true believers, or they keep their mouths shut. RICO prosecutions aren't necessary; the deterrent already exists. Since that occasion, I've not been approached once to serve on any agency review panels.

The same day your editorial appeared I read "China's Censors Confront Mounting Defiance" in your paper, in which we learn about a subversive book not allowed in China, as it seemingly undermines the government's religion of Mao and thus its own legitimacy. Individuals with such illegitimate views aren't tolerated in China. Is censorship in the U.S. rising to match that in one of the most repressive societies?

Full text:   New York City spends more to brace for rising seas and other side effects of climate change than any other of the world's 10 biggest cities -- about $2.2 billion last year -- outstripping spending by London, Paris, Beijing, Mexico City and other megacities, according to an analysis released Monday by researchers at the U.K.'s University College London.
While policy makers debate how best to curb global greenhouse-gas emissions that many scientists consider a leading cause of rising temperatures, efforts to adapt to the consequences of climate change have become a growth economy, steadily rising about 27% during the past seven years, the analysts said.
"Despite the level of political rhetoric in the U.S. and the U.K., cities like London and New York are taking climate adaptation seriously because they realize they have things at risk and things to protect," said the study's lead researcher Lucien Georgeson in London.
The study, reported Monday in Nature Climate Change, is among the first to assess how much cities are spending to prepare for climate change.
To gauge how spending varies globally, Mr. Georgeson and his colleagues looked at climate-related finances during a single fiscal year in 10 of the world's largest cities, as measured by population and gross domestic product: New York, London, Paris, Beijing, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Mumbai, Jakarta, Lagos and Addis Ababa. The researchers pulled together financial data from hundreds of independent sources.
By their calculation, New York spent more than 100 times as much as Addis Ababa during the 2014-2015 fiscal year under study.
"We found the difference between Addis Ababa and New York to be really striking," said Mr. Georgeson.
On a per capita basis, Paris spent the most of the 10 cities, about $553 per resident. New York spent about half that, about $269 per capita. But Jakarta, Lagos and Addis Ababa, where urban population growth in coming decades is expected to be among the highest, spent less than one-tenth per person the amount funded by New York.
All told, New York City is spending about $20 billion in local, state and federal funding on various climate-change countermeasures that will take many years to complete, city officials said.
About half of that is going toward coastal protection and urban drainage projects, to better shield hospitals, subways, public housing, and power equipment from storm-surge flooding.
"We are, at the same time, investing billions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions," said Daniel A. Zarrilli, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's senior director of climate policy and programs.

Full text:   NAM DIEN, Vietnam -- Vietnam's economic planners have set out on what could be their biggest-ever engineering project: A network of walls designed to hold back rising sea levels that are swamping fertile rice-growing regions.
At first glance, it is the kind of multidecade effort that the world's richer countries might throw their weight behind. In Paris in December, industrialized nations committed to providing $100 billion a year to help poorer ones cope with climate change. Vietnam's hulking, concrete sea walls would seem to fit the bill.
Not everyone is waiting to see how the dikes work out.
On a chilly January day recently, Do Van Duy slugged back another shot of rice liquor. It had been a good year for raising fish in the Red River delta of northern Vietnam. He and other villagers in Nam Dien had gathered to toast their success -- and question whether climate change is such a bad thing after all.
"We live better now," said Mr. Duy, who now farms grouper, shrimp and crab in the brackish waters of the delta after giving up rice. "If you can make the switch there's a lot more money to be made."
Nearly three-quarters of households in Nam Dien have abandoned rice farming, said Bui Van Cuong, a fisheries official with the People's Commune in Nam Dien, as saltwater flows farther into the delta's farmland. "The changes are very apparent over the past 10 years," Mr. Cuong said.
The shift is focusing attention on a difficult question: Is it better to invest resources in fighting the effects of climate change, or in helping people adapt?
The idea behind the Paris pact is that richer countries -- the ones mostly to blame for pollution that scientists say is contributing to rising temperatures and higher sea levels -- should pay to help poorer ones adjust. Some of the money is intended to help developing countries acquire cleaner power and limit further rises in the planet's temperature.
What isn't so straightforward is how developing nations should protect themselves or change practices.
Consider Vietnam's Mekong and Red River deltas. Like the Ganges and Nile deltas, they are already feeling the effects of environmental changes. In the lower reaches of the Mekong, saltwater is penetrating as far as 60 kilometers (37 miles) inland during the dry season, according to government meteorologists, killing crops and forcing farmers to leave or find a new way of making a living. Some 30 million people live in the Mekong delta, with 18 million more in the Red River delta.
Vietnam's initial response to the threat: build a wall.
In Nam Dien, construction was completed a few months ago on a 20-kilometer dike designed to slow the flow of saltwater into the area and prevent erosion. It is part of the broader system of dikes and seawalls with which the government aims to defend a centuries-old network of earthen levees. The project will add up to hundreds of miles of walls and take 40 years to build.
That is a long time, though. Some say Vietnam's communist leaders should sharpen their focus on helping farmers such as Mr. Duy adapt to the changing environment.
"Their competitive advantage is changing," said Le Anh Tuan, a director at the Institute for Climate Change Studies at Can Tho University. "The delta might not always be the best place to grow rice, but people can raise shrimp instead."
There are signs the government is listening. Mr. Cuong, the fisheries director, is among a network of officials helping rice farmers switch to raising fish, rather than fighting environmental changes.
It isn't easy. Farmers have to learn a whole new way of working, from filtering water to investing in healthy fingerlings. "The biggest problem is land," says Mr. Cuong, 38.
Farmers typically need to borrow from relatives or local banks to buy large plots of land to accommodate a commercially viable fish pond. On average, a pond is around 2,000 square meters (21,500 square feet) in the Red River delta, and sells for around $90,000 -- a significant sum in Vietnam, where incomes average about $5,600 a year.
If run well, though, fish farms can be three to five times as productive as rice, he says. Living standards have improved as a result, with Mr. Duy and his neighbors earning up to $20,000 a year.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court's unexpected move this week to block a federal carbon-emissions rule was a significant blow to President Barack Obama's environmental agenda, underscoring the unusual way in which that ambitious agenda is now in a state of suspended animation.
Mr. Obama's administration has pushed rules on everything from emissions to waterways to fracking. But the courts have begun to question whether it has exceeded its legal authority, and their final decisions will determine whether Mr. Obama's environmental legacy will be monumental or more modest.
The Supreme Court's stay of the rule limiting carbon emissions by power plants -- which will remain in place while courts consider more than 30 lawsuits -- is the third instance since last fall of federal courts have halting major new environmental rules.
Courts have blocked an Interior Department rule setting stricter standards for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and an Environmental Protection Agency rule that would bring smaller waterways and wetlands under federal protection. The regulations are in precarious positions less than a year before Mr. Obama leaves office.
"When the pendulum starts to swing toward executive authority, there's going to be a real likelihood that the courts are going to pull back a little bit," said Jim W. Rubin of Dorsey & Whitney LLP, a former environmental lawyer with the Justice Department. The president's environmental legacy "will be determined by what survives court scrutiny."
Behind these cases is a core battle between the executive and legislative branches. Republicans say Mr. Obama, in taking unilateral actions, is acting like a king and not a president. The White House responds that Congress's refusal to act on critical issues like climate change -- or even recognize it as a problem -- leaves Mr. Obama little choice.
While the high court's action is far from final, it raises questions about a landmark international climate-change accord reached last year in Paris that Mr. Obama sees as the centerpiece of his environmental legacy.
Mr. Obama has rolled out nearly two dozen major rules and scores of smaller ones during his tenure, aimed at clamping down on pollution from oil, natural gas and coal, and at compelling industries to shift toward renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.
Similar clashes over alleged presidential overreach are taking place on other hot-button issues. The Supreme Court this spring will consider the president's plan to defer deportation for millions of illegal immigrants. A lower court is considering a suit by Republicans alleging the Obama administration defied Congress in how it paid for part of the Affordable Care Act.
White House officials said they are confident the courts will uphold the EPA rule, and they suggested Mr. Obama won't stop pursuing executive actions despite legal setbacks.
"Litigation over this administration's policies, and in particular Clean Air Act standards, is nothing new," said Dan Utech, deputy assistant to the president for energy and climate change. "In litigation the pathway is not always smooth. But at the end of the day, we prevail. And we are confident we will do so here. The Clean Air Act gives EPA clear authority -- and legal responsibility -- to regulate carbon pollution from the power sector."
The administration's recent legal difficulties follow notable earlier successes. The EPA won a major ruling in 2012 when an appeals court upheld rules setting greenhouse-gas emission standards for automobiles. That court also blessed a central EPA finding that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are a danger to public health and likely have been a driver of global warming over the past half-century. The Supreme Court chose not to review those findings.
The tide seemed to turn in mid-2014 as courts began airing concerns about executive authority. The justices chastised the EPA for seeking to expand a clean-air permitting program to include greenhouse gases without clear congressional authorization.
The latest EPA rule would require a 32% cut in power-plant carbon emissions by 2030, based on 2005 emissions levels.
The Supreme Court considers several hard-to-meet criteria for stay requests, including whether the challengers will likely win their case and whether the denial of a stay will result in irreparable harm.
Supporters of both sides said they couldn't recall another instance when the justices intervened to stay a new regulation whose legality had yet to be fully evaluated by a lower court. "It clearly indicates that five justices have grave doubts about EPA's legal authority to do this rule," said Thomas Lorenzen of Crowell & Moring LLP, a former Justice Department lawyer who defended earlier EPA rules.

Full text:   Regarding Patrick Michaels's "The Climate Snow Job" (op-ed, Jan. 25): The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration methodology change appears to introduce potential for significant errors that likely overstate the global-warming trend. Even with that trendline boost, the magnitude of warming since the late 1990s still falls well short of climate science predictions that drive today's environmental policies.
Mr. Michaels argues that signs of global warming and its extreme effects are misinterpreted and exaggerated and therefore far from settled. He may be right from a scientific study and data-analysis standpoint, but do the numbers really matter? Challenging the climate-change consensus gets scientists ridiculed, discredited and bullied into silence. By contrast, manipulation of warming data by using fudge factors, corrupted data or by changing measurement standards is defended, condoned or covered up as trivial foibles in a fight to save the planet from humans.
A battle against climate change represents the greatest global opportunity for expanding government control of lifestyles and achieving social justice through redistribution of the world's wealth. Last year's encyclical on the environment from Pope Francis captured the overriding moral and economic dimensions of climate change and how they eclipse simple statistics. He said: "Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it." Changes in lifestyle for a greater good must be orchestrated by government. Climate science has to be settled so that moral and economic progress can occur and a more just world order established. Skeptics are spitting into superstorm winds.

Before offering the usual round of amens when they read Mr. Michaels's piece, readers should see what is posted on the NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information list of the "Sixteen Warmest Years (1880-2015)." It is easy to find, discusses the impact of El Nino in more detail and shows a very clear pattern of significant warming in the recent past that doesn't depend on El Nino or changes in what temperature measurements are used.
Does Mr. Michaels really believe that the scientists who shared this data are so blindly and conspiratorially wedded to proving global warming that it is OK to only use their data when it supports his case?

Full text:   CALGARY -- Canada's efforts to curb greenhouse-gas emissions are calling into question oil majors' ability to tap the world's third-largest oil reserves.
The new left-leaning government of the Canadian province of Alberta, which came to power in May after 44 years of conservative rule, has announced it would cap carbon emissions from its oil-sands industry, a move that threatens to strand billions of barrels of crude from supplies so vast that only Saudi Arabia and Venezuela control more.
Nine of the world's top oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., BP PLC, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, have invested tens of billions of dollars into megaprojects in the province's boreal forests. Combined, those operations account for 23% of these companies' proven crude reserves, according to data from investment bank Peters & Co. -- up from only 5% in 2006.
Marathon Oil Corp., China's Cnooc Ltd., Total SA of France and Norway's Statoil ASA round out the group of global players exploiting Canada's oil sands.
Most of these producers have taken a wait-and-see approach toward the cap, details about which remain to be worked out. Privately, executives at some oil multinationals with oil-sands assets express dismay about the sudden policy shift, and the heads of some smaller companies have voiced their concerns publicly.
"The cap is a long-term issue for province and the country," said Glen Schmidt, chief executive of Laricina Energy Ltd., an oil-sands lease owner. "How will it be allocated to companies who in good faith have purchased rights to produce and invested in technology as we have?" he said.
Canada's federal government defers to its provinces to come up with policy prescriptions to curb overall emissions. Alberta's new climate plan, announced in November, would cap its oil-sands industry's greenhouse-gas emissions at 100 million metric tons a year. The industry currently emits 70 million metric tons of greenhouse gas a year -- about a quarter of the province's overall emissions.
Based on growth projections at the time, Canada's environment ministry said in December of 2014 -- the latest projection available -- that the oil-sands industry is likely to cross that 100 million metric-ton level as soon as 2020.
Shell, which welcomed the policy along with three local Canadian oil-sands producers, said it didn't expect the cap would have a negative impact on its existing operations or force it to take impairments related to its undeveloped reserves. The company said it is confident the advent of new technologies and other policy initiatives would mitigate the impact of a carbon cap.
Oil majors have increasingly been turning to Alberta, helping boost Canadian oil-sands production by 38% over the past five years. Companies such as ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Shell have booked more than one-third of their proven crude reserves from the oil sands, according to the Peters report. Most other known untapped crude reserves are owned by state-owned firms in top oil-producing countries and are largely off limits to private companies.
Oil firms' proven reserves are an important indicator of their ability to grow. Canadian heavy crude may be expensive to extract, but companies point out that other potential sources such as Arctic or deep-water offshore fields are also high cost and, unlike Canada's oil sands, would require extensive exploration to find and substantiate crude oil deposits.
Despite low prices, oil-sands production is expected to increase through 2020 as a result of expansion projects approved years ago. Oil-sands developments cost billions of dollars and take years to build, but produce at stable levels for a decade or more -- unlike short-lived shale-oil wells.
Exxon said last year that 2014 marked the 21st consecutive year it replaced more than 100% of its production. More than half of its newly booked crude reserves -- amounting to some 700 million barrels -- came from oil sands assets in Canada, it said.
However, the recent crude slump -- with oil prices hovering around $30 a barrel -- has hit producers' bottom lines and forced many to abandon or suspend development of new projects. Western Canadian heavy crude costs more to extract than other oil sources because it must be separated from deposits of sand and trades at a discount to other crudes, in part because of the distance it must be transported from remote boreal forests in Alberta. It also is among the most greenhouse gas-intensive to produce. It also trades at a discount: On Friday, Western Canada Select crude oil closed at 25.74 Canadian dollars (US$18.12) per barrel.
The prospect of Alberta's carbon cap looms large because it could thwart development even if oil prices rebound.
The policy presents a real-world test case in a much broader debate now raging among investors and resource companies: Whether a more concerted global effort to reduce greenhouse emissions could keep companies from fully exploiting their resources, diminishing their value to shareholders.
The debate has gained new traction amid the run-up to the Paris climate change accord last month, during which 195 countries united around a document that is effectively a blueprint for how the world will tackle global warming.
Oil industry executives have dismissed the idea that they will be forced abandon undeveloped assets, noting fossil fuels will remain an important energy source for decades to come.
Current volumes of proven crude reserves aren't likely to be affected by Alberta's cap since they reflect projects that already have regulatory approval, most of which are operating or under construction. But companies may find it harder to tap their vast quantities of contingent resources.
"It's more the future projects that are affected," said Keith Braaten, president of Calgary-based reserve auditor GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd.

Full text:   Shortly after a conservative website on Wednesday posted 2008 footage of Sen. Marco Rubio backing a cap-and-trade program to combat climate change, his campaign roared back with a counterattack that included an entire web page aimed at debunking the video.
Mr. Rubio's response revealed how toxic the issue of climate change has become in the Republican Party under President Barack Obama, who has sought to make reducing carbon emissions to alleviate global warming one of his signature accomplishments.
As speaker of the Florida House, Mr. Rubio did vote for a 2008 bill authorizing the state to come up with rules for a cap-and-trade plan, though he raised questions about its cost and effectiveness.
But since running for U.S. Senate in 2010 as the conservative alternative to then-Gov. Charlie Crist, Mr. Rubio has questioned whether climate change is man-made, and opposed potential remedies like cap-and-trade that he says would hurt the economy.
Shifts by Mr. Rubio and some of his rivals recall a past that many in the GOP would like to forget: Republicans, not Democrats, first championed market-based systems to control pollution, as a way to avoid more direct regulation.
Until 2008, many Republicans supported cap-and-trade. Once Mr. Obama won the White House, Republicans swiftly unified against nearly all of his initiatives, including a cap-and-trade bill that would have set limits on carbon emissions and allowed companies to trade pollution credits to comply.
Responding to what they call big-government overreach by Mr. Obama, many Republicans have moved to the right on several other issues as well, including illegal immigration, health-insurance mandates and the Common Core academic standards.
GOP candidates who had generally accepted the scientific consensus on man-made climate change, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have said recently that it is unclear how much, if at all, humans are contributing to warmer temperatures.
The GOP front-runners, Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), have been the most consistent in questioning and even denying climate change.
For now, that consistency has worked to their advantage, Republican strategists say, leaving rivals little room to outflank them on the right.
Meanwhile, the three Democratic candidates, including front-runner Hillary Clinton, have consistently pushed for more aggressive climate policies than Mr. Obama's.

Full text:   As a Democrat, I never thought I would say this, but I agree with Sen. Ted Cruz -- on ethanol. As "Cruz Takes on Ethanol In Iowa -- and Vice Versa" (page one, Jan. 7) points out, Mr. Cruz could become the first candidate in either party to oppose the ethanol mandate and win the Iowa caucuses.
It's time to stop catering to the ethanol lobby by endorsing a flawed policy that science shows is worse for our environment and climate than gasoline. If Mr. Cruz prevails in the Iowa Republican caucuses, the handwriting will be on the election-night returns. Bad policy on ethanol isn't good politics anymore, even in Iowa. I wish my fellow Democrats, climate-change champions, would come to the same realization.
When I was a senior adviser in the Gore and Kerry campaigns, the ethanol cause seemed like a win-win. We believed it was good politics in Iowa and good policy, too. The science wasn't there yet showing that ethanol exacerbates the global warming it was supposed to reduce. In his 2009 book on climate change, Al Gore wrote that he made a rare mistake on environmental policy by endorsing corn ethanol as he courted Iowa voters. Mr. Cruz's rationale is obviously different. He instinctively opposes mandates and subsidies of most kinds -- except those benefiting Big Oil. But whatever his motivations, on this issue at least, Ted Cruz is right.

Kudos to Sen. Cruz for having the guts to take on the ethanol lobby in Iowa. The requirement to add this corrosive contaminant to gasoline is the worst current example of government power being used to enrich the few (corn farmers and ethanol producers) at the expense of the many (everyone using gasoline-powered engines), all justified by bogus environmental benefits.

Full text:   It is fascinating that an economics professor like David Neumark would analyze an economic policy from a narrow perspective and not consider broad, long-term impacts ("The Evidence Is Piling Up That Higher Minimum Wages Kill Jobs," op-ed, Dec. 16). He reports that a 10% increase in the minimum wage is expected to result in a 1% to 2% drop in employment of low-skilled workers earning the minimum wage. Assuming that his worst case scenario is this 2% loss of jobs in this low-wage group, let's consider the immediate effects. Out of 100 workers two would lose their jobs as a layoff and be eligible for unemployment compensation. The other 98 of these 100 workers would get raises of 10%. The net increase in wages for the entire group will be 7.8%, without including the unemployment compensation for those laid off. Surely Mr.
Neumark would agree that a policy change causing a wage increase over 7.8% for a significant group would be positive for society and a significant economic stimulus for the geographic area affected. Whether new jobs are created by this amount of economic stimulus is probably one of the reasons why economic research has different outcomes related to increases in the minimum wage.

Mr. Neumark's recap of economic research that reconfirms the deleterious effect of minimum-wage hikes on jobs was welcome, but do we seriously have to keep convincing the deniers of basic economic principles that raising the cost of anything (that is not addictive or critical for survival) reduces demand for that good or service? Do we really not have enough common sense, logic, elementary understanding of human behavior and evidence to declare that an inverse cost-demand (or price-demand) relationship is settled economics?

Our current equilibrium (high marginal taxes to support a welfare state for many people at the bottom of the income scale) is neither the only nor probably ideal equilibrium. One can imagine higher minimum wages lowering the number of people drawing supplementary income from federal programs (Medicaid, disability, housing, food and health-insurance subsidies), thus lowering government expenditures, and lowering the justification for high marginal taxes. Lower marginal taxes in turn help expand the economy, increase GDP, wage growth and offset many, if not all, of the jobs lost to higher minimum wages.
A higher minimum wage and lower marginal income tax in conjunction is a policy which might do just that.

After reading Mr. Neumark's piece about the job-killing effects of minimum-wage hikes, I was left with the feeling that if the same standards were applied to economics as to climate change, the science would be settled.

The difficulty in sorting out minimum-wage-raise results may stem from labor as investment rather than consumption. Certainly one consumes less as costs rise. But maybe the labor price imbalance is settled in a two-step process. First, the owner attempts to justify the higher wage by reorganizing the work environment to make employees more productive. Then the owner realizes he or she needs fewer of the now more productive employees.
One need only contrast the lower-tech McDonald's I worked in 40 years ago with many more employees and a far simpler menu to see the relentless employment decline in a minimum-wage-forced, more productive work environment.

Full text:   KNOTTINGLEY, England -- The last deep-pit coal mine in the U.K. plans to shut its doors here this week, heralding the end of a centuries-old industry that helped fuel the industrial revolution and build the British Empire.
The shutdown, targeted for Friday, represents a victory for advocates of reducing carbon emissions even before world leaders reached a landmark agreement in Paris this weekend. It also reflects a glut of energy on world markets, from crude oil to natural gas and coal itself.
Coal mines have been closing around the world in the past year, from the U.S. to South Africa to the U.K., as prices plunged. But in no country has the industry witnessed such a dramatic fall from grace as in the U.K., where coal production was once seen as the backbone of the nation's industrial economy, the fuel for everything from steamboats to power plants.
George Orwell, in his 1937 book "The Road to Wigan Pier," wrote: "Our civilisation. . .is founded on coal."
No longer. Deep-mine coal production in the U.K. hit an all-time low of 3.7 million metric tons in 2014, down from a peak of 217 million tons in 1954, according to the U.K.'s Department of Energy and Climate Change. At the time, about 1,330 deep-pit mines accounted for 95% of the U.K.'s coal production.
That number will hit zero with this month's closing of U.K. Coal's Kellingley Colliery, which has been operating since 1965 about a 30-mile drive from the historic city of York. A small number of "open-cast" surface mines in the U.K. will continue to produce.
The Kellingley mine produces 8,000 tons of coal a day and employs 451 people, down from more than 2,000 in the 1970s, the company said. An estimated 30 million tons of coal will remain stranded in the ground.
"The world has moved on," said David Cross, a librarian at the National Coal Mining Museum for England. "But it's a change in the entire basis of the world economy, not merely in this country."
The U.K. already imports most of the coal that fuels its power plants, with imports first surpassing local production in 2001. Russia has been the biggest beneficiary of the U.K.'s increased appetite for imported coal, providing 46% of its thermal coal in 2014, according to the U.K. government. Coal supplies roughly one-third of the energy for electricity generation in the U.K., with natural gas and renewable sources making up the rest.
Kellingley, operated by U.K. Coal, is the victim of vast market forces that pushed prices for thermal coal -- the kind used to fuel power plants -- to their lowest level in more than nine years at $45.10 a metric ton, according Rotterdam coal futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange. It costs Kellingley about $65 to produce a ton of coal, compared with $45 a ton for imported coal, a company official said.
In the U.S., as cleaner-burning natural gas replaces coal as a fuel for power plants, coal producers have started shipping their product abroad, weighing on demand for more expensive homegrown coal in the U.K. and elsewhere. And with consumption slackening in China and elsewhere, global coal shipments are falling for the first time in 21 years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Investors have been pulling back from coal, in part because of concerns about global warming, helping push coal miners' stocks into free fall. The Church of England in April said it divested GBP 12 million ($18.3 million) worth of thermal-coal and tar-sands assets, citing concerns about climate change.
The future of coal as a fuel for power was widely discussed in Paris. Environmentalists say the reduction of coal-fired power plants in the European Union has been too slow. The U.K. government has proposed to eliminate all coal-fired power plants by 2025.
To be sure, coal demand is forecast to rise through 2040 unless the world, and China in particular, takes drastic action, according to the International Energy Agency. The coal industry has argued that it is wrongheaded for governments to give up on a plentiful, cheap energy source such as coal and has called for investment in new technologies that would catch carbon at its source, known as carbon-capture storage.
Meaningful action on the climate will be "more expensive, if not impossible, without widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage technology," said Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, citing U.N. statistics.
Still, the forces aligning against coal have devastated the U.K. industry, where successive governments -- both Conservative and Labour -- have refused to provide meaningful financial support to coal since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher defeated a miners' strike in the 1980s.
Shaun McLoughlin, Kellingley's mine manager, said he finds the mine's closure "very disappointing."
"But also I understand the economics of it. We're living in a free-market world," he said.
For the miners here, many of whom have spent decades working in dark tunnels to hammer coal from seams hundreds of feet below the ground, the shutdown represents a failure of government policy to support what they see as an important industry for the nation.
Keith Poulson, who represents the National Union of Mineworkers here, said the damage to the local economy from the shutdown will be "massive." He said the government should have helped support the U.K. mining industry during the big decline in coal prices with subsidies, because prices are likely to shoot up again.
"We've been asking for some support to get through these troubled times and the door has been slammed in our face," he said.

Full text:   President Barack Obama notched a victory on the world stage with the completion of a global climate accord, but the White House still faces resistance at home as Republicans and some U.S. industries push back against the policies underpinning the deal.
For the president, the agreement forged in Paris by more than 190 nations ends a yearslong quest to craft a new, global approach to curbing climate change and to secure his own environmental legacy. An upbeat Mr. Obama on Saturday hailed what he deemed a historic deal.
The deal was structured in a way that doesn't require congressional approval.
Many Republicans, though, have vowed to unravel the Obama administration's efforts. GOP lawmakers have launched a multipronged approach to undercutting the president's climate agenda, and most of the Republican presidential candidates have pledged that, if elected, they would undo Mr. Obama's executive actions aimed at curbing global warming.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has said he would repeal Environmental Protection Agency rules cutting carbon emissions that form the central component of the U.S. commitment to the global climate accord. Last week, as climate negotiators met in Paris, Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) decried "global warming alarmists" and said there had been no significant warming of the planet during the past 18 years.
Obama administration officials have said they are confident the U.S. will follow through on its climate commitments, even after this president leaves office. On Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged the possibility of a Republican president undoing Mr. Obama's executive actions but said he didn't expect that to happen.
"I don't believe you can be elected president of the United States if you don't understand climate change or you're not committed to this kind of a plan," Mr. Kerry said on ABC.
Republicans on Capitol Hill aren't waiting to take aim at Mr. Obama's climate policies. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) described the accord as "nothing more than a long-term planning document."
"The president is making promises he can't keep, writing checks he can't cash and stepping over the middle class to take credit for an agreement that is subject to being shredded in 13 months," Mr. McConnell said, adding that Mr. Obama's commitments would hurt jobs and raise utility rates.
Congressional Republicans already have passed measures challenging federal rules to cut power-plant emissions, but any binding measure would be vetoed by the president. Republicans also have sought to upend the administration's efforts to funnel federal dollars to developing nations so they can tackle climate change as part of a United Nations program. The question of whether to include that funding in a spending bill has been a sticking point in negotiations that were under way on Sunday, congressional aides said.
Democrats say the president is on firm footing as he works to implement the climate deal. "There is no realistic path for our commitments to be undermined," said Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii).
Still, the administration must navigate an array of challenges to its environmental policies. Two dozen states have sued to stop the EPA regulations aimed at cutting carbon emissions.

Full text:   PARIS -- The landmark climate agreement that more than 190 countries struck in Paris over the weekend ushers in a broad, new international effort to wind down the fossil-fuel era.
But as two weeks of tumultuous negotiations made clear, the pact's success hinges on individual countries making painful choices -- especially in how they produce and consume energy -- that could profoundly shape corporate behavior, financial markets and the global economic landscape.
Paul Polman, chief executive of European-based consumer-goods giant Unilever PLC and an outspoken environmental advocate, said the deal sent an "unequivocal signal to the business and financial communities, one that will drive real change in the real economy."
Others, especially from the fossil-fuel industry and some U.S. companies, were more critical or played down the impact of the agreement. Stephen Eule, vice president for climate and technology at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbies Washington lawmakers on behalf of large U.S. companies, said the deal risks damaging the U.S. economy by pushing the country toward more costly energy from renewable sources.
"The Paris climate conference delivered more of the same -- lots of promises and lots of issues still left unresolved," he said. "The White House's overall domestic strategy of making energy more expensive and less abundant to satisfy international constituencies, many of whom compete against the United States, should worry the business community, American workers and consumers."
Supporters hope the deal will unleash an avalanche of financing and investment from entrepreneurs, companies and international lenders into renewable energy sources, technologies such as electric cars and new ways to capture and store gasses from carbon-intensive fuels such as coal.
Still, Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, an industry advocate, said the agreement left room for the coal industry to grow, especially with renewed financing for carbon capture and storage to stop emissions from being released into the atmosphere.
At the core of the agreement, reached Saturday evening in a suburb of Paris, is a collection of voluntary plans submitted by every country to tackle climate change, each reflecting its own economic and political situation. Most of them focus on shifting to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and, for some, nuclear power and away from carbon-heavy fuels such as coal and oil.
While the plans lay out a monumental challenge, in aggregate they still don't meet the level of cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions that the agreement itself targets. Much of the success of the deal also lies in implementation years from now, by governments that haven't yet been elected. The accord's requirement to review the ambition of the planned cuts to emissions provides what supporters hope will be an open-ended commitment to deeper cuts.
The plans aren't legally enforceable -- a condition the U.S. among others insisted upon -- though the deal does legally bind countries to a periodic review process that backers of the accord hope will prod countries to repeatedly raise their emissions-cutting efforts.
In addition, developed countries have to help provide at least $100 billion annually from a variety of sources after 2020 to help developing countries cut their emissions.
Getting to that agreement was a bumpy path and an outcome that surprised many participants and observers as ambitions in the negotiating rooms grew. A key alliance that sprang up was among a group of small developing nations led by the tiny Marshall Islands, along with Mexico and Colombia -- and the European Union. All wanted a tough agreement that wasn't only legally binding but also aimed for a more aggressive target in curbing the rise in average global temperatures.
The conference's stated goal was to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The islands wanted a goal of 1.5 degrees, arguing that aiming for the 2-degree target wouldn't be enough to prevent them from being wiped out by rising sea levels, based on most scientific forecasts.
While the U.S. wasn't willing to go that far, it soon joined forces with the alliance, offering to join their calls for a more ambitious target in exchange for acknowledgment that developed nations wouldn't take on the liability for the damage to poor countries caused by rising sea levels and more frequent, more intense storms.
One U.S. demand shaped the conference before it even began: In a divided Washington, Republicans who control Congress vowed to reject anything the Democratic Obama administration sent there for approval. For Todd Stern, who headed the U.S. negotiating team in Paris, that ruled out any legally binding commitment to cut emissions, a major goal of the Europeans and some other countries.
That large caveat thrust a top State Department lawyer into the center of the fray. Susan Biniaz was the arbiter on the critical matter of what would or wouldn't require U.S. congressional authorization during the talks.
The differences were settled in the night between Friday and Saturday, when developed countries agreed to continue leading on financing, leaving large emerging markets like China free to make just voluntary contributions. In return, developing countries accepted regular reviews and checks of their voluntary plans to curb emissions.

Full text:   Scientists hailed the Paris agreement on climate change as an important step forward to reducing the most severe impacts of a warming earth -- welcoming mechanisms intended to keep nations ambitious about reducing carbon emissions, but wary about how vigilant they will end up being.
"Climate change will continue, but now at a much-reduced pace this century relative to what it would be without an international agreement and adherence to it," said Jeffrey Kargel, a researcher at the University of Arizona.
The agreement, signed by more than 190 countries, aims to keep the warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and stakes out the more ambitious goal of keeping it 1.5 degrees below.
The countries also agreed to ratchet up their level of emission reductions every five years, starting in 2018.
"If they increase their emission cuts after 2025, we'll see more reductions in temperature," said Simon Lewis, an environmental scientist. "We'll see . . . if that occurs."
The danger is that countries' pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions may yet falter. Legislaturescould fail to ratify the pact, or future governments might undo pledges made by their predecessors.
Richard Allan, climate scientist at the University of Reading, added: "Paris has delivered a plan, next begins the hard bit: action."

Full text:   PARIS -- Setting the rules for how developed nations will pay for poorer ones to respond to climate change was the key obstacle to a deal late Friday, as negotiators haggled past the scheduled deadline of international talks here.
Beyond that dispute, a group of climate scientists said the latest draft on Friday showed serious inconsistencies and would require much deeper cuts to emissions than currently foreseen.
Officials were seeking a compromise between poor nations demanding assurances that the money will be there and rich nations pushing wealthier developing nations, such as China, to pay part of the bill. They were also grappling with U.S. concerns about requirements to provide finance, given the difficulties of getting spending legislation through the U.S. Congress.
The persistent disagreements over money on Friday suggested difficulties on Saturday morning, when French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who is leading the talks, aimed to release a final draft.
"Everything comes back to the provision of finance, the predictability of finance, the scaling-up of finance," said Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko, a South African official who represents more than 100 developing nations in the talks. "That's the test of this agreement."
Mr. Fabius said he expected a deal on Saturday. "The conditions have never been this favorable," he said.
A draft released by Mr. Fabius on Thursday night eliminated many disagreements that had hobbled talks so far, but left open how much financial help the world's poorest governments can expect to get to adjust to rising temperatures, and whether developing countries will be required to measure and report emissions as accurately as rich states.
According to the draft, governments will commit to hold the average rise in global temperatures "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and "pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C."
That was a victory for small island states that say a 2-degree warming would result in rising seas swallowing their lands and depriving their citizens of homes and livelihoods.
Yet a panel of five climate scientists -- convened at the site of the Paris talks -- said the rest of the draft agreement didn't back up that promise. To keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees, man-made emissions of carbon dioxide have to be reduced to zero by 2050, the scientists said.
"You cannot say we'll stay under 1.5 [degrees] on the one hand and not say anything on decarbonization on the other hand," said Steffen Kalbekken, director at the Norway-based Centre for International Climate and Energy Policy. "Otherwise it is meaningless."
Unlike earlier drafts, which included plans to cut global greenhouse-gas emissions by up to 95% by 2050 from 2010 levels, the draft text saw emissions peaking "as soon as possible," giving developing countries extra time.
In the second half of the century, the world should reach "greenhouse-gas emissions neutrality," the draft text said. That means emissions would be so low that they could be absorbed by the earth's natural mechanisms, such as plants and oceans, or new technologies such as carbon capture and storage.
"There is an inconsistency between near-term and long-term ambition," said Joeri Rogelj, a scholar at the Energy Program of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria.
National pledges to limit greenhouse-gas emissions fall far short of reaching even the less ambitious goal in the draft text and would still see global temperatures rise by around 3 degrees from preindustrial levels, according to U.N. and other scientists.
The draft agreement foresees governments reassessing their emissions pledges every five years, but this review process doesn't start early enough, the scientists in Paris said. Under the draft, the first full global stocktaking of emissions wouldn't happen until 2023. By then, the scientists said, emissions will likely have surpassed the maximum allowed under any existing 1.5-degree scenario.
Officials familiar with the latest negotiations among national delegations said there was still some pushback on the review mechanism and the overall targets of the deal.
India, one of the world's biggest CO2 emitters, was still lobbying for the reviews to be voluntary and, along with Saudi Arabia, wanted to eliminate the reference to the 1.5 degree target, said Bas Eickhout, a European Parliament member for the Dutch Green Party following the talks.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Mxakato-Diseko said the draft of the climate-change deal was too vague about who will pay for developing nations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and protect themselves from impacts of climate change.
"You get vague language such as 'finance will be provided' -- by whom?" she said.

Full text:   PARIS -- Nations moved closer to a global climate deal that has eluded them for more than 20 years, as compromise emerged on some of the most controversial issues facing negotiators at a summit here, even as other problems remain unresolved.
A new draft unveiled on Thursday showed that an agreement is in sight, after 11 days of talks did little to bridge differences that have bedeviled negotiators since nations first agreed to pursue an international climate-change deal in 1992.
"They are obviously much closer to the finishing line," said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group.
Perhaps the biggest breakthrough came in the overall target guiding the cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that nations would enact under the proposed agreement. The draft says nations will limit the increase in average surface temperatures to "well below" two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the dawn of the industrial era, and "pursue efforts" to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.
Still, other issues remain, such as financing for the developing world and how the burden of fighting climate change should be divided between rich and poor nations, with little time left in the talks to find solutions. Hopes now rest on whether Europe, the U.S. and some of the world's poorest nations can compromise with a group of developing countries that are resisting calls to shoulder more of the burden in the fight to limit global warming.
The developing-nation group, known as Like-Minded Developing Countries, represents the hard core of opposition to the U.S., the EU and other developed nations. It includes developing-nation giants such as China and India, oil-producing states such as Saudi Arabia and staunch critics of the West such as Iran, Venezuela and Bolivia.
Members of the Like-Minded group didn't comment on the new draft as talks moved behind closed doors on Thursday evening.
European officials voiced cautious praise of the new text. The new draft is "looking better, bolder," said one official, but cautioning that more work needed to be done on ensuring all governments accurately measure and report their emissions.
Countries most vulnerable to climate change insist on the 1.5-degree target, arguing that any more warming would result in catastrophic damage from rising sea levels and increased storm intensity. The United Nations says the globe has warmed about 0.9 degree since the late 19th century.
Tony La Vina, a senior negotiator for the Philippines, which represents a group of countries most at risk from climate change, said the proposed language on 1.5 degrees appears broadly acceptable.
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who is leading the negotiations, and other French officials put together the draft based on hours of nonstop negotiations among the 195 nations gathered at the Paris climate summit. It is still uncertain if the compromises drafted by Mr. Fabius will be acceptable.
Thursday's draft also sets greenhouse-gas neutrality as a goal for the second half of this century. That means nations have agreed to commit to cut their fossil-fuel emissions to such a low level that the Earth's natural mechanisms for absorbing these gases -- through plants and other means -- can offset man-made emissions.
While the EU and the U.S. have narrowed differences with some of the poorest nations in recent days, much of the Like-Minded group opposes committing to more ambitious emissions-reduction targets or to provide financing for poor nations to respond to climate change. Their priority must remain fighting poverty within their borders, they say.
Thursday's draft wouldn't require developing countries to provide financing for climate-change projects in the poorest nations, a provision that may draw objections from developed nations.
Mr. Fabius gave ministers 2 1/2 hours to examine the text before deciding whether the French proposals are acceptable, but talks were expected to continue long into the night.

Full text:   MANILA -- The Philippines is set to open 23 coal-fired power plants over the next five years to meet rising electricity demand, illustrating the challenge climate-talk negotiators face in crafting a deal that reduces carbon emissions.
A new draft of the agreement released Wednesday -- after almost 10 days of talks among 195 nations -- showed that some fundamental points remain up in the air, including how much money developing countries should get to help switch away from fossil fuels.
The U.S. announced it would double aid to help poor countries adapt to the effects of climate change, to at least $860 million by 2020, in a signal that rich governments will stick to their part of the deal.
Governments also still haven't decided by how much temperatures should be allowed to increase, or whether emerging economies will take on more responsibilities.
In most of the developed world, competition from natural gas and environmental regulations have crippled the coal industry, bankrupting companies and snuffing out jobs in the U.S. and Europe. But in the Philippines and in dozens of other developing countries, coal remains an essential fuel for building more prosperous societies.
The commodity is cheap and abundant, supplying about 40% of the world's energy, according to the International Energy Agency. But coal is also responsible for a third of all carbon emissions, and its use is projected to rise -- especially in Asia.
Environmentally minded leaders, especially from the West, want to curb coal use. But many developing countries, aware that it fueled the industrialization of the U.S. and Europe, argue that coal is key to their future too.
Manila's building bonanza will make it Asia's most coal-dependent country by 2035 as a percentage of its energy mix, according to IHS Energy Insight, a research company. Government officials say the booming economy needs the coal plants to offset declining domestic reserves of natural gas.
The government's position is at odds with the country's self-image as environmentally progressive. A third of the country's power is now generated by renewable sources, chiefly geothermal and hydroelectric.
Filipinos became acutely conscious of climate change after scientists blamed global warming for the intensity of Typhoon Haiyan, which killed over 7,000 people and ravaged the country's central provinces two years ago.
At the climate talks in Paris, the Philippines is leading a 20-nation group, the Climate Vulnerable Forum, comprising countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Vietnam that are most at risk from rising temperatures.
Before arriving, President Benigno Aquino III pledged the Philippines would reduce its carbon emissions 70% by 2030.
"We all have to do as much as we can," Mr. Aquino told Asia-Pacific leaders in Manila in November. "Countries have to contribute the maximum."
The Philippine government said in its Paris pledge that the 70% cut would be conditional on financial assistance and the transfer of green technology from more-developed nations, but that ambitious reductions could be made in various sectors, including energy.
Yet, according to IHS, the Philippines will nearly triple its fleet of coal plants by 2020, while doubling the amount of CO2 to 70 million metric tons a year by 2025.
The Philippines is hardly the only country depending on coal.
Vietnam plans to double its coal plants to 40 by 2022 to tide it over until a generation of nuclear generators comes on line. Indonesia is encouraging more coal-fired plants to support its mining industry.
China added an extraordinary 39 gigawatts in new coal-fired capacity last year, according to official data, enough to power millions of homes. Even Japan is building dozens of new coal plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.
But while the use of coal in countries like China and India has yet to peak, the commodity is projected to be a smaller proportion of their total fuel mix in the coming decades.

Full text:   Bangladesh built Sushil Kumar Sarkar a cyclone-resistant home on his land near the Bay of Bengal as part of a government-funded program to protect the region from rising storm intensity that scientists say is a result of climate change.
Fearing it could collapse at any time, Mr. Sarkar refuses to live in it. "This house isn't fit for my cows, let alone my family," he said, standing in front of the dark and damp one-room building.
Far away in Paris, rich and poor countries are negotiating a global climate-change agreement. At the heart of the talks is a debate over how the world's wealthiest nations will pay to help people like Mr. Sarkar in the world's poorest cope with the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and more frequent and powerful storms.
The sums involved are huge. Wealthy nations have pledged to channel at least $100 billion a year to poorer ones by 2020 -- and possibly more after that -- to pay for a vast array of infrastructure, from cyclone-resistant housing to wind turbines to farms that can flourish in salty soil.
Developing countries say donor nations should ease regulations on how the money is spent. But the developed world is wary, and Mr. Sarkar's house highlights why: Rich nations fear that weak government institutions, lack of resources and corruption in poor countries mean climate funds will be wasted. "We don't hand over $100 billion to whoever asks in developing countries," said Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's state secretary for environment.
Poorer nations say they don't have time to navigate the rich world's maze of red tape when faced with what they call the emergency of global warming. At the Paris summit, they are demanding more control over how the money gets spent.
"It should not be conditional. It should not be earmarked," said Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko, the South African diplomat who is representing a group of more than 100 developing nations in the talks, "because we know what we're dealing with in our countries. We know better."
To give developing nations more control over climate funds, wealthy ones are exploring new ways of delivering aid. The U.S., Europe and others have pledged $10 billion for the Green Climate Fund, which is geared toward allowing poor countries to propose and manage large climate-change projects -- provided that they meet a long list of other criteria.
The Green Climate Fund tentatively approved its first eight projects in November, though officials say it may be a year before money flows.
In Bangladesh, wealthy donor countries set up a climate-finance fund in 2010 that was supposed to give more power to the government over aid decisions. Though initially managed by the World Bank, the goal was to establish a secretariat for the fund the Bangladeshi government would run. But last year, the donors and the World Bank decided to shut it early.
A fund established by the Bangladeshi government using its own money has been more active. But the projects it financed, such as the shelter for Mr. Sarkar, have been undermined by lack of resources and oversight, say Bangladeshi officials and nonprofit groups.
Mr. Sarkar's house is one of more than 2,000 houses built by Bangladesh's Department of Disaster Management at a cost of nearly $3 million between 2011 and 2013.
Local residents say the houses were initially built without walls: Officials argued that the "open" design would help make the houses cyclone proof. After an outcry from civil society organizations, walls were added more than a year later, locals say.
Riaz Ahmed, director general of the Department of Disaster Management, said some houses weren't built properly "due to lack of monitoring at local level."
"We are investigating and will take action, including confiscation of contractors' security deposits and blacklisting them if necessary," he said.

Full text:   PARIS -- Strands of a deal on tackling climate change emerged Tuesday, but divisions remained on the two most contentious issues: Who will help developing countries pay for less-polluting energy generation and adapt to rising temperatures; and whether emerging economies take on larger responsibilities in the fight against global warming.
Two days of negotiations among ministers managed to bridge some differences that had hamstrung the first week of talks here.
Most of the 195 governments involved in the negotiations now agree that national plans to limit greenhouse-gas emissions should be reviewed every five years, said Tine Sundtoft, the Norwegian environment minister.
National emissions pledges so far would still see global temperatures rise by around three degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels, above the two-degree target of the talks.
Negotiators also indicated concessions to small-island states, which say any increase beyond 1.5 degrees would threaten their survival. A reference to the 1.5 degrees in the agreement would allow for ratcheting up emissions cuts in the future.
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he would present delegations with a new draft for the climate agreement by Wednesday afternoon.

Full text:   PINGDINGSHAN, China -- Chinese negotiators traveled to climate talks in Paris this month with a rare tailwind: the country's slowing growth.
China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, and images of Chinese cities blanketed by smog remain common. On Monday, Beijing issued its first-ever "red alert" for hazardous air, effective Tuesday, ordering half the capital's cars off the streets and a halt to construction, and urging residents to stay indoors.
Still, there are signs that as China's economy starts relying less on heavy industry and more on consumer spending, it will also pollute less. And across China, including here in sooty Pingdingshan, entrepreneurs are racing to profit from China's push for a cleaner economy.
Alongside the drop in China's growth rate -- the economy expanded 6.9% in the third quarter, its slowest rate since 2009 -- China's power demand has flattened after years of double-digit expansion, and its coal use and imports have plummeted.
The slowing growth has given China greater room for big pledges on cleaning up its environment and curtailing emissions in the coming years, even as emissions continue to rise today.
China has promised to peak its carbon emissions by 2030, if not earlier, a sign Beijing believes it can separate growth of its economy from rising emissions levels.
"China's pledges are very forceful if compared with those of some developed countries," Premier Li Keqiang recently said of China's climate commitments to the United Nations.
The pledges by Beijing have contributed to some optimism as the Paris talks continue. China's approach is "definitely not business as usual," said Jonathan Pershing, a former U.S. lead climate negotiator, now principal deputy director at the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis.
But the question for China's leaders -- and policy makers globally -- is whether the transition to slower-but-cleaner growth will be sustainable. While Beijing may envisage creating tens of thousands of high-value jobs in sectors such as wind power and electric cars, providing enough work to satisfy its huge labor force is difficult. If growth were to falter more, leaders could choose to pump up investment in old industries that support jobs, such as steel.
China's goal of raising its share of nonfossil fuels in the energy mix to around 20% by 2030 -- up from around 10% in recent years -- remains daunting. The country will need to deploy as much as 1,000 gigawatts in new clean energy capacity, according to U.S. government estimates -- roughly equal to the U.S.'s entire capacity.
China's ability to meet those goals and sharply slash emissions over the longer term will help determine whether the world's nations can limit rising global temperatures. China accounts for over one-fifth of carbon emissions world-wide.
Proponents of aggressive climate action by China say cleaning up its economy and creating jobs can go hand-in-hand. Yulong Zhu, an entrepreneur in the coal city of Pingdingshan, in central Henan province, is part of an emerging crop of businessmen who want to profit from China's pledge to curtail emissions.
Henan officials say they have been heeding Beijing's calls to strengthen environmental protection. Among new orders, cities including Pingdingshan and Henan's capital, Zhengzhou, are requiring builders to use higher proportions of eco-friendly materials in their projects, particularly public works like roads and social housing.
There, Mr. Zhu saw opportunity. His company, Nasdaq-listed Yulong Eco-Materials Ltd., whose revenue largely comes from making ready-mixed concrete for customers, now competes for government contracts to haul building-material waste, such as old cement from dilapidated buildings. Yulong then reprocesses the waste into paving bricks and other materials used for the base layer of roadways.
"The government's stance toward environmental issues has really clearly intensified," said Mr. Zhu.
Yulong says it expects big growth in its recycled brick business thanks to new government policies. It finished a new dormitory for employees this year, and is ramping up hiring.
Growing anxiety over environmental degradation across Chinese society underpins confidence of those like Mr. Zhu, who believe the nation's leaders are committed to greener growth.

Abstract: U.S. Republicans and other critics of the Paris climate talks are seizing on concern about China's reliability, after Beijing earlier this year disclosed it had burned around 14% more coal in recent years than previously reported.

Full text:   PARIS -- Countries pushing to complete a global climate accord face a challenge as they try to wrap up talks this week: How to trust that nations will live up to their commitments.
Largely because of resistance from the U.S., national pledges to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, which are at the heart of the Paris negotiations, likely won't have legal force.
So American and European negotiators are insisting the accord have a clear system for measuring and reporting emissions. Accurate data on emissions, they say, will form the basis for updating emissions-reduction pledges to make sure global warming can be kept within acceptable limits.
Emerging economies such as China and India are pushing back, saying external checkups on their emissions are unwanted interference. Smaller developing nations say they lack the means and expertise to work by the same standards as richer governments.
The push for a new, more-unified system to measure and verify national emissions is part of a larger effort to narrow the decades-old division between developed and developing countries under international climate agreements.
It is one of a host of issues, including financial support for poor countries, that technical negotiators failed to resolve last week and which are bound to keep ministers, who arrived in Paris on Saturday, busy as they try to seal a deal to tackle global warming. Talks are scheduled to wrap up on Friday, but many officials expect them to run into the weekend.
U.S. Republicans and other critics of the Paris climate talks are seizing on concern about China's reliability, after Beijing earlier this year disclosed it had burned around 14% more coal in recent years than previously reported.
Moreover, the scandal over Volkswagen AG's diesel emissions also is pushing officials and environmental groups to take a second look at what countries and companies are doing behind the scenes.
The U.S., which wants to avoid binding emissions targets, backs mandatory standards of transparency, a point President Barack Obama underscoredon Tuesdayin Paris.
The most recent draft for the Paris deal, released on Saturday, highlights controversies surrounding emissions measuring and reporting.
The article dealing with transparency stretches over two of the draft document's 43 pages and contains multiple options laying out different reporting requirements, including some that would shield China and India from having to play by the same rules as traditional developed countries.
In the EU, high standards of accountability and transparency are important for member states, including Germany, that are undertaking expensive transitions away from fossil fuel. Officials say by forcing countries at least to regularly report on what they spew into the air, other governments and civil society can apply peer pressure to hold laggards accountable.
Accurate data, these officials say, would clarify whether governments should step up emission reductions to make sure average temperatures don't rise more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.

Full text:   World leaders are hammering out ways to cut their countries' carbon emissions in Paris. But what about all the carbon dioxide -- from planes and ships -- emitted outside any one country's borders?
Airlines and the global maritime industry count among the world's biggest CO2-emitting industries. Unlike emissions from power plants or passenger cars, CO2 from planes and ships plying international routes don't count toward any country's total emissions. Those national totals are the main subject of haggling in Paris this week and next with the aim of creating a concrete plan to limit man-made climate change.
Pressure is growing on negotiators in Paris to figure out how to handle that uncounted CO2, and whether to force the industries' global watchdogs to establish credible plans of their own to rein in air and sea emissions.
One big challenge: It is hard to determine just how much CO2 the two industries are emitting in the first place.
A recent European Parliament report estimated between 3% and 4% of global, man-made CO2 emissions came from international commercial flights and shipping. Left unchecked amid broader efforts to reduce emissions, that share could grow to as much as 40% of the global total by 2040, the report warned.
The International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations body, puts the current contribution from international aviation to global C02 emissions at 1.3%. Its shipping counterpart, the International Maritime Organization, said in a report last year that from 2007 to 2012 emissions from ships averaged 3.1% of the global output.
The issue wasn't at the top of the climate-change agenda among negotiators in the yearlong run-up to the Paris talks. But the threat of a more forceful approach to restricting air and sea emission has long shadowed those industries. It is also flaring anew as an irritant for environmental groups, which say executives haven't done enough to produce a plan on their own.
"Progress has been insufficient," said Andrew Murphy, a representative for Transport & Environment, an environmental advocacy group.
A paragraph in the preliminary draft of the Paris accord -- a document global leaders hope will lead to a concrete plan -- could require that countries work through the U.N. agencies to slice up emissions from such international trips by air and sea and apportion them to individual countries.
The ICAO and IMO have taken leading roles in trying to broker the details of any agreement, and representatives of both are in Paris now.
Countries with rapidly growing airlines, or those heavily dependent on tourism, argue any moves to limit flight emissions will favor more mature markets, such as those in the U.S. and Europe. The airline industry, meanwhile, has fought against what it worries would be a patchwork of national regulations and taxes that would govern its emissions.
The European Union has threatened that the lack of a global agreement on international flight emissions could spur it to revive efforts to include them in its carbon cap-and-trade mechanism, something carriers so far have fought successfully.
"We are supportive of ICAO putting together a framework that governs the entire planet," said Mark Dunkerley, chief executive of Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings Inc. He said the industry already has done "a tremendous amount" to reduce carbon emissions through the use of more-efficient engines, cutting weight on airplanes and washing engines more frequently to make them operate more optimally.
Paul Steele, corporate secretary at the International Air Transport Association, which represents more than 200 carriers, said the body welcomed an international agreement in Paris. Such an accord would "help resolve the developed-versus-developing country climate standoff," he said.
The ICAO, meanwhile, is pushing what it calls market-based measures, like carbon offsets. The U.N. body estimates that the cost of an international carbon-offset trading system could cost the industry between $6 billion and $20 billion, depending on the market price of carbon.
For the shipping industry, the IMO has imposed an efficiency standard for ships built since 2013. That standard requires ships to be 30% more energy efficient by 2025, a move that would reduce carbon emissions, too. The International Chamber of Shipping, a trade body representing global shipowners, has pledged a 50% increase in energy efficiency per ship by 2050.
Those steps, however, won't curb emissions from the large fleet of existing ships that will take decades to replace with more-efficient models.

Full text:   The day before "Your Complete Guide to the Climate Debate" by Matt Ridley and Benny Peiser was published as a Nov. 28 op-ed, former NASA scientist James Hansen, considered by many to be the father of the U.S. climate concern, wrote: "The danger is that Paris will lay a Kyoto" wherein "each country promises to do better."
He warned: "Watch what happens in Paris carefully to see if all that the leaders do is sign off on the pap that U.N. bureaucrats are putting together, indulgences and promises to reduce future emissions, and then clap each other on the back and declare success."
The same James Hansen warned back in 2006: "We have at most ten years -- not ten years to decide upon action, but ten years to alter fundamentally the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions" before it is too late.
Is it too much to hope that the futile global climate crusade collapses to free public and private resources for here-and-now problems, not distant, hypothetical, unlikely ones?

While climate change is the elephant in the room, what environmental doomsayers never mention is that the environment in the freer-market, publicly accountable Western democracies is cleaner by almost every metric than it's been in more than 100 years -- far better air quality, far fewer unsecure landfills, much better drinking water quality, far better wastewater treatment, far better lake/river water quality, light years better air and water treatment technologies, many more robust habitats. Having worked on hundreds of environmental projects over the past four decades, I've seen this improvement firsthand, though it's a deep, dark secret to the public at large because these facts don't fit the apocalyptic environmentalists' narrative.

Messrs. Ridley and Peiser cite three principal reasons to question the idea that rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide will cause catastrophic global warming: the planet was significantly warmer thousands of years ago, world temperatures have gone up far less than predicted, and observed "climate sensitivity" to carbon dioxide emissions is much lower than climate models assume. These are indeed relevant arguments.
I submit, however, that the authors, like many others writing in opposition to the global-warming scare, overlook the primary objection: The prediction that global warming will cause immense environmental damage is an assumption that cannot be verified. It is an example of consensus science, which in recent decades strangely has pervaded the scientific community but is not science at all.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Republican-controlled House approved a pair of measures blocking federal rules to cut power-plant emissions, a symbolic move aimed at sowing doubt about President Barack Obama's climate agenda while world leaders gather in Paris to forge an accord on the problem.
Tuesday's votes are part of a multifront attack congressional Republicans are mounting against Mr. Obama's climate policies. GOP lawmakers also are working to prevent federal dollars from supporting global climate efforts, and considering separate energy legislation this week that they say shows a stark contrast between their priorities and Mr. Obama's.
Meantime, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in Iowa, said that "I'm not sure I would have gone to the climate summit if I was president today," due to concerns about the potential U.S. economic impact of an agreement.
The House measures aim to nullify recent Environmental Protection Agency rules that cut carbon emissions from existing power plants and limit emissions from new ones. The Senate passed similar measures in mid-November, employing a rarely used legislative tool that allows the chamber to nullify recent federal rules with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes required for most bills.
Citing the regulations' aim of improving public health and fighting climate change, the White House has said Mr. Obama would veto the measures. Republicans likely lack the votes to overturn such vetoes.
The EPA regulations represent the central commitment Mr. Obama is making to the United Nations conference that began Monday and extends through Dec. 11. Mr. Obama wrapped up a two-day visit to the summit Tuesday.
"You have the president leaving Paris, and you'll also have a contrast," House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) told reporters on Capitol Hill. "[With] what the president's proposing now -- a regulatory cap-and-trade [program] -- you'll see disapproval, not just from the Senate, but in the House as well."

World News: Indonesian Fires Are a Burning Issue at Talks

Abstract: Brazil, once synonymous with rain-forest destruction for soybeans and cattle, reduced the practice by around 75% starting in 2002, said the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S. advocacy group, although the problem has again flared in the past year or so amid growing demand for soy, palm oil and beef.

Full text:   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Fires consumed a roughly 6.2-million-acre swath of land here this fall, much of it set to expand plantations that drive Southeast Asia's largest economy and feed global demand for its palm oil, pulp and paper.
That released around 1.75 billion tons of greenhouse gases, potentially bumping Indonesia up to the fourth-largest emitter in the world from sixth place in a span of just weeks, researchers said. The portion of the country's emissions that comes from deforestation is the world's highest, scientists say.
Globally, the practice contributes to about 11% of climate-altering gases, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, so addressing it is a key component of any climate deal in Paris, where the role of forests and land use as a contributor to climate change is being discussed.
On Tuesday, Indonesian Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said her country is cracking down on those responsible for illegally setting fires, the Associated Press reported.
President Joko Widodo said he was ashamed that authorities failed to prevent the fires, and he ordered law-enforcement agencies to punish perpetrators, including revoking forest concessions and blacklisting those responsible, the AP reported.
Indonesia has lagged behind other countries in preserving forest land while expanding its economy. The palm-oil and pulp-and-paper industries employ several million people and reap billions of dollars of annual revenue in a country that struggles with inequality.
Other major forested countries have improved their records. Brazil, once synonymous with rain-forest destruction for soybeans and cattle, reduced the practice by around 75% starting in 2002, said the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S. advocacy group, although the problem has again flared in the past year or so amid growing demand for soy, palm oil and beef.
India now plants more trees than it cuts down, and Mexico provides financial incentives for reforestation, the organization said, following periods of massive deforestation in both countries.
Indonesia, however, saw a decline of nearly 15 million acres of primary forest from 2000 to 2012, a study published last year in the journal Nature Climate Change said.
"Indonesia is the laggard," said Chris Meyer, senior manager for tropical forest policy at the Environmental Defense Fund, a U.S. advocacy group.
A complex network of economic interests drives the fires. Environmentalists often blame plantation owners. Plantation owners tend to blame locals. Unclear land ownership can add to the confusion.
Mr. Widodo on Monday signaled in Paris that Indonesia would overhaul the way it manages its forests as he tries to fulfill the country's pledge to reduce emissions by 29% by 2030, including restoring forests and peat land.
"As a country with one of the largest forest areas acting as the lungs of the world, Indonesia is here today as part of the solution," he said.
He said Indonesia would establish a peat-restoration agency. One plantation owner, Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings Ltd., on Tuesday said it would invest $100 million over 10 years to expand protection and restoration of carbon-rich peat lands in central Sumatra.
To reduce fossil-fuel emissions, Mr. Widodo said his government would pursue a plan to increase the use of renewable energy to 23% of national energy mix by 2025. He also cited current rules aimed at combating forest clearing, including a moratorium on new development in primary forest and peat land.
But the economic pressures are great. Indonesia produces 52% of the world's palm oil, an industry whose exports earned $18 billion last year, according to the Center for International Forestry Research.
"The reason fires happen is because people are making a lot of money off of them," said Louis Verchot, director of environment research at the Bogor-based Center for International Forestry Research.

Full text:   PARIS -- World leaders struggling to sharpen their attack on Islamic State received a welcome boost from the U.K., which appeared set to join U.S.-led airstrikes against the extremist group in Syria.
At a climate summit in Paris, leaders grappled with the difficulties of forging a broader international coalition to counter the threat of the violent Islamists given persistent divisions between Russia and Western nations. French and U.S. officials said Russia's military operations had shifted slightly in a positive direction in recent days, while Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested greater optimism.
"On the whole, I think we have an understanding of where we need to go," Mr. Putin said at a news conference in Paris after he met with President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the summit.
Mr. Obama and French President Francois Hollande dined together at an upscale Paris restaurant Monday night, where they discussed the campaign against Islamic State. The working dinner was held at l'Ambroisie, a short distance from where some of the Nov. 13 terror attacks struck.
The arrival of British warplanes to the Syrian battlefield could provide capabilities on par with the U.S. Air Force and allow a potential broadening of the fight.
Mr. Obama came to the French capital seeking an international accord to stem the effects of global warming. But questions about his counterterrorism strategy and about whether the U.S. and France could partner with Russia followed Mr. Obama to the city where gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people on Nov. 13.
The French president traveled the globe last week in search of what he called "a grand and single coalition," meeting with the U.S., U.K., German and Russian leaders. French officials said they hoped that Mr. Hollande's shuttle diplomacy has persuaded Mr. Putin to concentrate his efforts on Islamic State instead of rebels opposed to the Syrian regime.
A U.S. intelligence official said that while more of Russia's firepower has been directed at Islamic State in recent weeks, the majority of its strikes still are targeting moderate rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- some of them backed by the West. The U.S. continues to believe that Russia's No. 1 priority is shoring up Mr. Assad, the official said.
A French official said after the dinner with the French and American leaders, there was cause for optimism.
"There is something of a convergence," the official said.
World leaders may hold a meeting on the long-term political situation in Syria before the end of the year, the official said.
Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama, described "a mixed picture," saying before the Obama-Hollande meeting that Russia still hasn't abandoned efforts to target other rebel groups in Syria.
"Yes, there has been some focus on ISIL," Mr. Rhodes said, using another name for Islamic State. "At the same time, we continue to believe that there's too much military activity taking place against other elements of the opposition."
At his news conference, Mr. Putin said he and Mr. Obama discussed drawing up a list of groups in Syria considered terrorist organizations and a list of groups considered a healthy part of the Syrian opposition.
"If we talk about the need for a political solution, then we have to work on a new constitution, on new elections and monitoring of their results," Mr. Putin said.
In his conversation with Mr. Putin on Monday, Mr. Obama repeated that the Syrian president must leave power as part of a political resolution to end the civil war in Syria, administration officials said. But Turkey's decision to shoot down a Russian plane last week is complicating efforts to bring Moscow into an international coalition.
Mr. Obama expressed regret to Mr. Putin about the aerial confrontation, U.S. and Russian officials said. Mr. Obama, who previously has publicly defended Turkey's right to protect its territory, urged Moscow and Ankara to move to de-escalate tensions.
While Mr. Obama told world leaders at the summit that they couldn't wait to act on climate change, the urgency of the threat posed by Islamic State extremists at times threatened to overshadow that message.
In London, British Prime Minister David Cameron set a debate for Wednesday on whether the U.K. should join in the airstrikes in Syria against Islamic State targets, saying he believes there is "growing support" in Parliament for military action. The debate will likely be followed by a vote.
The main opposition Labour Party said it would allow its lawmakers to vote their conscience on the issue, making majority support more likely.
Mr. Cameron has been urging lawmakers to support extending Britain's yearlong bombing in Iraq to Syria. But he also has said he would only do so if there was parliamentary support, and he would only proceed with a parliamentary vote if he was confident of winning.
"It's in the national interest. It's the right thing to do. We'll be acting with our allies. We'll be careful and responsible as we do so, but in my view it's right to do this to help to keep our country safe," Mr. Cameron said.

Full text:   Several big oil companies have fallen into unlikely alignment with environmental groups calling for new taxes on air polluters like coal-burning power plants. One key reason: Those taxes are probably good for their natural-gas businesses.
Energy giants including Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC hope a so-called carbon tax -- which would force companies to pay for their emissions and likely increase oil producers' costs -- also would increase demand for natural gas, an increasingly significant part of their output.
The companies are part of a collection of business interests, environmental activists and economists that have urged negotiators meeting at a U.N. climate-change summit in Paris over the next two weeks to consider potential carbon-pricing policies as a tool to curb emissions. Such programs could open new markets in China and elsewhere for gas to displace coal.
Most carbon-tax plans being discussed wouldn't much affect transportation fuels that oil companies already sell, says the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Automobile fuel is already heavily taxed in much of the world, while coal-heavy power production often isn't.
"Coal," BP's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said in an October speech, "is likely to be more affected by future climate policies than either oil or gas."
The embrace of carbon taxes demonstrates how some oil companies now see a business opportunity as efforts to enact climate-change policies gain momentum. While not entirely new, oil companies have become more vocal in their support for carbon taxes in recent years.
Oil companies including BP, Shell and France's Total SA joined forces in recent months to push for action on climate change, calling for taxes to encourage the use of cleaner-burning gas over coal. BP has said switching just 1% of world-wide power production to gas from coal would have an equivalent emissions reduction as increasing renewable-energy generation by 11%. Exxon Mobil Corp. isn't part of the coalition, but in recent years it has expressed support for a carbon tax, provided it is offset by tax reductions elsewhere.
Their support for a carbon tax carries relatively little risk, says Kurt Van Dender, the head of the tax and environment unit for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of first-world countries that includes the U.S. and Western European nations.
Around 80% of carbon emissions in the U.S. and Europe come from power plants and big industrial sources that largely use coal, he said.
"The relative increase [in costs] will be much higher for these nonoil types of energy," he said.
Coal producers say any financial incentives to reduce CO2 emissions should be directed toward the development of carbon capture-and-storage, or CCS, technologies that force emissions into underground reservoirs.
"Market mechanisms, including carbon pricing, should not impose punitive costs but should instead provide revenues that can be directed toward the deployment of low-emission technology, including CCS," said a spokeswoman for the World Coal Association, an advocacy group for coal producers.
Positioning "coal as the villain and gas as the solution" isn't a productive long-term approach to curbing climate change, said Daniel Litvin, managing director of Critical Resource, a London-based resource-extraction consultancy. Shifting to natural gas from coal is "pretty far off the major transformation that's needed," he said. On Wednesday, his group said oil companies should focus more on alternative energy and energy efficiency.
A global carbon tax is unlikely to emerge from the U.N. climate summit, but any international commitment to reducing emissions likely will result in individual countries implementing their own version of pricing carbon.
The pro-carbon-tax talk hasn't taken oil companies out of the sights of environmental groups and policy makers who want to reduce fossil-fuel use. Shell this year faced protests in the U.S. for its exploration of the Arctic offshore Alaska, which environmental groups said could lead to pollution. Shell said it had taken all necessary precautions but pulled out of the project in September when drilling results were disappointing.
In November, the New York attorney general's office confirmed it sent Exxon a subpoena for information on the company's research on and response to climate change going back decades. The request followed stories by InsideClimate News that detailed Exxon's 1970s research into climate change and later support for groups that questioned climate science. Exxon has said it didn't do anything wrong.
Many environmentalists say the companies' support for a carbon price won't be sufficient to prevent global temperatures rising by dangerous amounts in the coming decades.
Greenpeace campaigner Charlie Kronick said he supports raising the cost of fossil fuels, but he says a carbon tax alone isn't enough to curb global warming, and could benefit the companies that sell fossil fuels. It "absolutely will not do what we need to do, which is dramatically reduce fossil fuels," he said.
Some oil companies, particularly in the U.S., remain suspicious of regulation and taxes overall. In a speech in October in London, Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson pointedly noted that the U.S. had curbed emissions with an increase in natural-gas usage for electricity "in the absence of a comprehensive cost-of-carbon policy."
Oil companies also oppose policies that would force a fast switch to more reliance on renewable energy, saying the world's energy needs are so great that fossil fuels will remain a part of the picture for decades.
The carbon-tax push isn't oil companies' first foray into promoting more environmentally friendly energy alternatives. In the 1990s, for instance, Shell and BP invested in solar energy and other renewable sources, but they have scaled back many of those investments, scrapping some altogether. A Shell spokesman said the company is continuing with a "multibillion-dollar" investment in biofuels.
Shell has produced more gas than oil on an annual basis since 2009. BP expects natural gas to make up about 60% of its total production by the end of the decade and nearly 50% of Exxon's production last year was gas.

Full text:   India's combination of growth prospects and greenhouse-gas emissions illustrates how developing countries face a delicate balancing act.
The country has almost 300 million people, about a third of its population, still living in poverty without access to electricity. Bringing those hundreds of millions access to energy while raising the living standards of the rest of India without breaking the carbon budget is one of the central challenges the Paris climate conference aims to tackle.
"India is so big it swings the balance of whether you get the reduction of warming you want or not. It's paradigmatic," said philanthropist and Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, who at the conference announced a multibillion-dollar energy-research initiative that includes both the government of India and billionaire Indian investor Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd.
As India's economy expands and its population grows wealthier and more urban, demand for energy is expected to double by 2040, accounting for roughly 25% of the total increase in consumption world-wide, according to the International Energy Agency, which tracks energy trends globally.
India has promised an ambitious program to expand solar, wind and nuclear power, so that more than half of all new energy capacity brought on line during that time will come from sources other than fossil fuels. Yet even if India accomplishes those goals -- and many experts are skeptical -- the country will still likely also be the fastest-growing consumer of coal and oil in the world by far, the agency said.
The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said it aims to add 175 gigawatts of wind, solar and other non-fossil fuel capacity by 2022, and to have those sources make up 40% of the country's installed electric-power capacity by 2030.
More than 160 countries have submitted plans in Paris for restraining or reducing carbon emissions to contribute to a goal of holding global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial times.
That is the amount to which the international community has decided the planet can manageably adapt.
Rather than commit to cutting emissions, or target a year for emissions to peak, India's pledge is to chip away at the amount of carbon used to fuel economic growth.
India was responsible for emitting only about 6% of global emissions in 2014, and just 3% of the cumulative global greenhouse-gas emissions since 1965.
At talks in Paris on combating climate change, Mr. Modi and French President Francois Hollande unveiled an initiative to get rich and poor countries to cooperate on expanding solar power. "It's making the dream of universal access to clean energy become more real," Mr. Modi said Monday.
Even as solar and wind energy use rise to 324 gigawatts from 24 gigawatts by 2030, the country will also use six times as much coal as its poorest people gain access to electricity, the IEA said.
"[India] didn't create the problem. It isn't really contributing much to the problem now," said Manish Bapna, executive vice president of the World Resources Institute in Washington, D.C. "The concern is the pathway India takes over the next 30 years."
The presumption at the Paris talks is that the biggest historic emitters of carbon will have to make do with less. The U.S. has contributed 24% of carbon emissions between 1965 and 2014 and 17% of emissions last year.
The U.S. has pledged by 2025 to cut emissions by 28% from 2005 levels. That is among the more ambitious pledges, but would still leave the U.S. using a disproportionate share of the world's overall carbon budget.
India's energy goals have been assessed as "everything from 'admirably ambitious' to 'heroic' to 'yeah, not going to happen,' " said Rahul Tongia, a fellow with Brookings India, an affiliate of the Washington, D.C., think tank.

Full text:   PARIS -- World leaders vowed to finish a deal to curb greenhouse gases and overcome a thorny divide on financing it, as they kicked off international climate talks against a backdrop of heavy security.
President Barack Obama called on governments to develop a long-term framework to cut greenhouse emissions, saying the time is coming when it will be too late. He pledged the U.S. would do its part to slow global warming, and urged other countries to "rise to this moment."
"I've come here personally as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter to say that the U.S. not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it," Mr. Obama said Monday.
At a heavily guarded airport complex outside Paris just two weeks after terrorist attacks killed 130 people in the city, other leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon underscored the urgency of addressing global warming in the two-week conference, dubbed the COP21.
Evidence of a long-standing divide quickly surfaced. Developing countries said the richest nations that have emitted the most carbon dioxide must do more to finance a transition to greener energy and help prepare poor countries to stave off the early effects of a changing climate.
Developing countries want their highly industrialized peers to make good on pledges to mobilize $100 billion a year in public and private climate financing from 2020 onward. Some officials have warned they won't support a deal in Paris that doesn't deliver high levels of funding. Any agreement would require the consent of nearly 200 countries.
To help bridge the divide, several rich countries unveiled programs to boost funding. Germany, Norway and the U.K. said they would provide $1 billion a year until 2020 for payment based on emissions reductions from forests and improved land use.
Mr. Obama and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates unveiled a multibillion-dollar program involving 20 countries to boost green-energy research and development.
Yet another commitment Monday -- from Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland -- would provide $500 million for projects in poorer countries via the World Bank.
Emerging economies made it clear that to conclude a deal in Paris, they want to see more progress in the 2020 goal and perhaps even more funding afterward.
"Developed countries should honor their commitment of mobilizing $100 billion each year before 2020 and provide stronger support to developing countries afterwards," Chinese President Xi Jinping said, adding that Beijing would also help finance poorer countries through its own funding vehicle.
South African President Jacob Zuma said rich countries have a "historic responsibility" to at least meet the $100 billion target.
Just before officials gathered, India slammed an October estimate on how much financing rich countries have provided to poorer countries, saying the "methodologies were inconsistent." The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which produced the estimate, sees India's criticism as "misjudged and inaccurate," according to Simon Buckle, head of climate change at the organization representing highly industrialized countries.
Ahead of the Paris talks, most of the countries involved submitted their own plans for curbing emissions of greenhouse gases linked to climate change or boosting the share of green energy after 2020.
An accord clinched in Paris would codify those national plans, part of an original goal to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
The current pledges are likely to limit global warming to only about 2.7 degrees, officials say, so the U.S., European nations and other countries want the Paris accord to require countries to renew their emissions targets every five years or so, helping shift the world toward the 2-degree goal over time.
"We are at the foot of a wall built from the sum of our egos, fears and resignation," French President Francois Hollande said as he opened the conference. "But this wall is not insurmountable."
Mr. Obama and most other heads of state will leave the talks by Tuesday, but delegates will keep negotiating with the goal of wrapping up an agreement by the end of next week.
The climate talks are taking place on the outskirts of a city still on edge in the wake of the deadly Paris terror attacks. France has moved to secure the city, shutting down some external access points and thoroughfares Sunday and Monday. Helicopters whirred overhead in downtown Paris and soldiers were a more visible presence on the streets.
After arriving in Paris late Sunday night, Mr. Obama visited the Bataclan concert hall where gunmen killed at least 89 people on Nov. 13. Mr. Obama stood in silence with Mr. Hollande and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, and each leader laid a single white rose in front of the building.

Full text:   The single most important benchmark underpinning this week's talks in Paris on climate change -- two degrees Celsius -- has guided climate-treaty discussions for decades, but scientists are at odds on the relevance of that target.
Many researchers have argued that a rise in the planet's average global air temperature of two degrees or more above preindustrial levels would usher in catastrophic climate change. But many others, while convinced the planet is warming, say two degrees is a somewhat arbitrary threshold based on tenuous research, and therefore an impractical spur to policy action.
"It emerged from a political agenda, not a scientific analysis," said Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London. "It's not a sensible, rational target because the models give you a range of possibilities, not a single answer."
Policy makers tend to assume the two-degree target expresses a solid scientific view, but it doesn't. The exhaustive reports published by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are considered to be the most comprehensive analysis of the science of global warming. Yet the two-degree limit isn't mentioned in a single IPCC report.
Still, many scientists back the goal because they see it as giving policy makers a clear-cut target to shoot at in the fight against global warming.
World leaders began arriving on Sunday to open two weeks of talks in Paris, triggering a lockdown of a city already on high alert since the Nov. 13 terror attacks that left 130 people dead.
The police closed major routes Sunday afternoon between airports, downtown Paris and the Le Bourget conference center, where the conference known as COP21 will take place. Using powers under a state of emergency, French authorities have banned public gatherings in Paris that climate activists hoped would express the city's resolve for action to curb climate change.
"It's traumatic and a real handicap that only those already involved will be able to express themselves," said Nicolas Hulot, a climate activist and the government's special envoy for the environment. "But I'm well placed to know that we have excellent reasons to ban these marches."
Still, thousands flouted the ban on protests, forming a human chain and calling on leaders to do more to fight climate change. The chain spanned an area near where gunmen and suicide bombers unleashed carnage just over two weeks ago.
Later, riot police fired tear gas as they clashed with demonstrators who refused to disperse from Place de la Republique, north east of central Paris. Police said 174 demonstrators were detained.
The vast majority of climatologists agree that the earth is getting warmer and that the emission of greenhouse gases by human activity is the main driver of this change. But the question of when a catastrophic tipping point might be reached is up in the air.
Some phenomena widely attributed to warming -- such as dramatic summer melting of Arctic sea ice and glacial retreat in Greenland -- are already evident today, even though the average temperature is one degree Celsius above preindustrial levels and thus some ways from the two-degree benchmark.
On the other hand, some dangerous consequences of warming might not become evident until long after the two-degree line is crossed.
"The whole apocalyptic metaphor is misleading," said Carlo Jaeger, chairman of the Global Climate Forum, a German think tank, and a professor at the University of Potsdam. "Hell is not going to break loose at two degrees -- it will take hundreds of years to unfold."
William Nordhaus, a professor of economics at Yale University, appears to have been the first to mention the two-degree figure in a paper published in 1977. But rather than making a robust scientific calculation based on the physics of climate change, his paper argued that a rise of two or more degrees would put the earth's climate outside the observable range of temperature over the last several hundred thousand years.
Thereafter, the two-degree benchmark slowly gained traction. Other scientists argued that global air temperatures hadn't risen beyond 1.5 or two degrees in the course of human history, and that greater temperature shifts eons earlier had triggered cataclysmic changes in sea level. They figured that a two-degree ceiling would therefore amount to a natural safety limit.
"The idea was, 'let's not move the human enterprise out of an evolutionary regime that we are adapted to,' " said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who helped popularize the two-degree goal.
In 1994, at a meeting in Bonn, Dr. Schellnhuber sat down with Angela Merkel, then Germany's minister for the environment. Since both are trained physicists, Dr. Schellnhuber offered complicated charts and figures for Ms. Merkel to peruse.
"I presented what I call 'the tolerable windows' approach," recalls Dr. Schellnhuber, then the German government's chief adviser on climate. "In terms of temperature, the tolerable window was limited to two degrees."
Ms. Merkel backed the target. The following year, she persuaded the Council of the European Union to formally endorse it.
More scientists began to support it, too. One 2003 study concluded that beyond two degrees, "the risks increase very substantially involving potentially large extinctions or even ecosystem collapses, major increases in hunger and water shortage risks as well as socioeconomic damages, particularly in developing countries."
In October 2014, David Victor, a professor of international relations at the University of California, San Diego, and Charles Kennel, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., wrote a sharp critique of the two-degree benchmark in the journal Nature.
They argued that the yardstick was scientifically weak because it captured only a tiny portion of the planet's climate profile. More than 93% of the extra heat, they noted, ends up in the ocean and not in the atmosphere.
For that reason, they said, policy makers should also track ocean heat content and other parameters when setting emission goals. In an article this month in Nature Climate Change, they and a third author said "a new list of planetary vital signs" is needed to take the full measure of climate change.
Prof. Victor also said the two-degree benchmark should be ditched because it is no longer an achievable target.
"The trajectory of emissions we're on now is so steep, it's too late," he said. "There's no scenario under which this could be contained below two degrees -- it's game over."

Full text:   The goal for next week's Paris summit was lofty all along: to hatch a climate accord strong enough to keep global warming at bay, built on promises from nearly 200 countries to limit their greenhouse-gas emissions.
President Barack Obama and other leaders will face immediate distractions when they huddle just outside the French capital on Monday to kick off a final, two-week effort to reach a global accord. Since the Nov. 13 terror attacks, Paris is under a huge police clampdown, with downtown rallies banned under a national state of emergency.
Mr. Obama already plans to spend part of his brief time there on antiterrorism talks with French President Francois Hollande.
Diplomats say the attacks have galvanized world leaders to demonstrate solidarity, increasing the chances of success on the climate front. Still, the recent violence won't soften unease over the climate accord in many countries, including the U.S., where Mr. Obama faces stiff opposition from Republicans in Congress and other critics.
Some big companies -- including several European energy giants and U.S. utilities -- have embraced the Paris talks as a path to greater predictability, including more certainty about the future price of carbon-based fuel.
But the biggest U.S. energy firms have withheld support, and coal giants are warning that efforts to curtail the use of affordable fossil fuels will hurt the poorest countries.
To succeed, leaders and their negotiators must bridge a decades-old rift between highly industrialized countries, whose growth was founded on the use of fossil fuels, and poorer countries demanding financial help for any deal that could impinge on their development.
Officials backing a climate accord in Paris have spent more than a year warning of rising sea levels, severe droughts and extreme weather that could come in future decades if countries don't take steps now to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for warming the atmosphere.
The main aim is to forge an agreement that would limit emissions enough to keep the average global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels -- a threshold agreed upon by scientists over decades and codified by officials at earlier summits.
But all of the national offers to limit emissions expressed so far, if sealed in a Paris agreement and extended decades into the future, would likely still result in warming of 2.7 degrees, experts say. That is about 1 degree less warming than would likely occur without a deal. But it also falls significantly short of the 2-degree goal, a frustrating outcome for island nations and other countries where small temperature changes can greatly affect weather and sea levels.
The U.S., Europe and other countries want the Paris accord to require countries to renew their emissions targets every five years or so, helping shift the world toward the 2-degree goal over time.
"You need successive rounds of new targets that ratchet up ambitions, and we hope that will be on five-year cycles," said Todd Stern, the U.S. special envoy to the talks.
More vulnerable developing countries want deeper cuts now from advanced economies to help them avoid adverse weather or even, in the case of some Pacific island nations, catastrophic inundation as ice caps melt and sea levels rise. Mr. Obama is set to meet leaders of island countries on Tuesday.
Other developing countries, including India, have resisted any commitments to revisit their targets in five years.
Emission-reduction plans offered by countries vary considerably, from steep cuts to carbon-dioxide emissions in the U.S. and Europe, to a Chinese goal to peak carbon emissions by 2030.
India's national plan doesn't involve any firm limits on greenhouse gases, although it does commit to bringing a massive amount of solar power online. Indian officials say they won't commit to steps that could prevent hundreds of millions of its citizens from using cheap energy to emerge from poverty.
Perhaps the biggest fight between rich and poor countries centers on who will pay for green-energy transitions and climate adaptation in countries that haven't emitted much carbon historically and don't have easy access to capital.
Highly industrialized countries are working toward a 2020 goal of mobilizing $100 billion a year in public and private financing to help poorer countries reduce emissions or prepare for an adverse climate. Officials may pledge in Paris to renew or even increase that level of finding, observers say.
"The $100 billion by 2020 -- that's the very first, critical step," said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations climate-change body, in an interview in Washington.

Full text:   SYDNEY -- Coal-mining companies whose stock prices have tumbled could use some friends. Instead, they have become the target of campaigners hoping to cast the sector as the new Big Tobacco.
With a meeting of global leaders to discuss climate change beginning Monday in Paris, the campaign has been building support. This week, German insurer Allianz SE, which manages roughly $2.1 trillion in assets, said it would no longer invest in mining companies or utilities that generate more than 30% of their sales or energy output from coal.
Allianz has about $4.25 billion invested in coal, mostly in bonds, and will gradually exit from the sector over coming months as they mature. Two years of talks on coal with several nongovernmental organizations, including Transparency International, WWF and Germanwatch, influenced the money manager's final call, although Chief Executive Oliver Bate said Allianz is also aware of efforts to slow global warming and what he said are the economic risks involved with coal-focused businesses.
Mining firms including Glencore PLC and Anglo American PLC have argued that they are working to make coal cleaner to burn and are important providers of jobs and fuel. But they worry environmental activists may persuade some big money managers to drop them for good.
"One of the challenges the coal sector faces is an increasingly militant antimining, anticoal campaign," Glencore coal chief Peter Freyberg said in a recent speech. "This campaign fundamentally ignores the global energy reality and the resources required for economic growth and development."
Coal producers' shares have been hammered this year, as rising supplies and slowing demand push prices to their lowest level in a decade. With economic growth weakening in places such as China and many power generators shifting to gas or renewable energy, global coal shipments are falling for the first time in 21 years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.
Growing antipathy to the fuel among some institutional investors is adding to the pressure. Fund managers -- from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund to religious and academic institutions and industry bodies, such as the Church of England, Canadian Medical Association and Stanford University -- have committed to rid themselves of exposure to coal. Even the city council of Newcastle, in eastern Australia, which is home to the world's biggest coal port, recently voted to abandon fossil-fuel investments.
Coal is relatively cheap, generating roughly 40% of the world's electricity and fueling many blast furnaces. But its use puts millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere -- making it the leading source of greenhouse-gas emissions thought by many scientists to cause climate change -- and releases pollutants known to harm human health.
The business also isn't growing much. The International Energy Agency predicts global coal demand will increase just 0.4% a year to 2040, a marked slowdown from the 4.1% annual growth of the past decade and well behind the expansion of sectors such as renewables, which it forecasts will overtake coal as the largest source of power generation by the early 2030s.
Earlier this year, activists including environmental group Framtiden i vare hender, or Future in our hands, persuaded lawmakers in oil producer Norway to block its nearly $900 billion sovereign-wealth fund from investing in coal stocks. The campaigners argued the fund would be better off investing in other, higher-yielding investments given coal's long-term outlook.
Coal's malaise makes it hard to distinguish the impact of the divestment from the impact of the poor market.
Norway's fund has sold stock in mining firms, including Peabody Energy Corp. Its shares are down 93% over the past year, and the company points to the anticoal investment campaign as a risk.
"The impact of such efforts may adversely affect the demand for and price of securities issued by us, and impact our access to the capital and financial markets," Peabody said in its latest annual report.

Full text:   Corrections & Amplifications
U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) is the majority leader in the House of Representatives. A U.S. News article Friday about the Republican Party and climate-change talks incorrectly identified him using his previous position, House majority whip.
(WSJ November 28, 2015)
WASHINGTON -- Republicans in Congress are mounting a multifront attack on President Barack Obama's climate-change agenda, seeking to weaken his position ahead of a Paris summit the president hopes will lead to a historic global agreement.
Republicans are targeting new Obama administration rules aimed at cutting carbon emissions from power plants, and are working to block federal dollars from supporting global climate efforts.
The House plans to vote next week -- the first week of the two-week summit -- on a pair of measures that would repeal Environmental Protection Agency rules to cut carbon emissions from power plants. The Senate voted to nullify the rules in mid-November in largely symbolic resolutions.
The EPA regulations represent the central commitment Mr. Obama plans to make when he travels to Paris in hopes of reaching a global deal on emissions cuts.
Opposition to Mr. Obama's climate-change moves has been a largely unifying move for Republicans at a time when they have split over many other high-profile issues, such as free trade and spending. While House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), has been leading on this issue, the effort is being done with the assent of Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the new House speaker.
The main effect may be to signal that Americans aren't unified behind Mr. Obama's efforts, since the legislative tools at Republicans' disposal likely aren't powerful enough to stop the president from forging a deal at the United Nations conference on climate change that starts Monday.
The White House, saying the power-plant regulations are important to public health and climate change, promises Mr. Obama will veto the measures should they reach his desk, and Congress likely doesn't have the votes to override such vetoes.
In his final stretch in office, Mr. Obama has pushed rules on everything from emissions to fracking to waterways, hoping to create an environmental legacy through administrative means while skirting the opposition of the GOP-dominated Congress.
Mr. Obama's top environmental priority has been a world-wide deal on climate change. Republican leaders say the effects of climate change are uncertain and don't merit sweeping reactions; Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, even tossed a snowball on the Senate floor last February to mock the climate change agenda, a gesture Mr. Obama called "disturbing."
Republicans now hope to undermine Mr. Obama's attempts to make Paris a showcase by arguing the EPA rules will hurt the economy without alleviating climate change -- and that they could be reversed by the courts or a future administration. Mr. Inhofe is sending at least one staffer to Paris and has said he may go himself.
"The president and his State Department officials are recklessly leading the world to believe we will live up to emission reductions the administration can't substantiate and won't even defend before congressional committees," Mr. Inhofe said recently on the Senate floor.
Democrats predicted these efforts wouldn't hamstring Mr. Obama in Paris and would backfire with voters. "It's somewhere between political folly and political suicide to do this," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.), who takes to the Senate floor weekly to warn about the dangers of ignoring climate change. "There'll be a big price to pay in November for this."
Republicans also are working to block the administration from funneling federal dollars to developing nations so they can tackle climate change as part of a U.N. program called the Green Climate Fund.
A year ago, Mr. Obama pledged $3 billion for the fund, and in his 2016 budget proposal earlier this year he asked Congress to appropriate an initial $500 million. More than 100 House Republicans signed a letter opposing the inclusion of that funding in the spending bill that Congress must pass to keep the government running beyond Dec. 11. That date coincides with the end of the Paris climate talks.

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- The European Union's climate and energy czar warned that an agreement on a global deal to fight climate change is far from certain days before negotiations kick off in Paris.
On Monday, world leaders open two weeks of talks in the French capital on how to protect the planet from the potentially catastrophic consequences of global warming. If successful, the Paris climate conference, also known as COP 21, could, for the first time, bind developed and developing countries into cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.
But after four years of preparations, big gaps remain among the 195 governments that have to agree unanimously on any deal.
At a summit of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations this month, some governments questioned central elements of the deal that many thought had long been settled -- including the overall target of keeping average global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.
"It shows nothing can be taken for granted at the COP," said Miguel Arias Canete, the EU's climate and energy commissioner, who will represent the bloc's 28 member states.
The conference is meant to deliver a follow-up agreement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Hopes of success in Paris had been rising after the U.S., which never ratified Kyoto, as well as emerging economies such as China and India that didn't have to cut emissions under that deal, submitted national targets for boosting renewable-energy sources and reducing air pollution.
In contrast to Kyoto, which was ratified by 35 countries covering just 12% of global emissions, 167 governments, responsible for some 94% of emissions, have submitted national targets to cut emissions in the run-up to Paris.
Still, added together, these contributions would see global temperatures rising by around 3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, according to EU and United Nations officials. Scientists warn that such an increase would lead to the melting of the Greenland ice caps, sharp rises in sea levels and dramatic weather patterns, such as droughts and hurricanes, that could threaten human survival.
The commitments made so far are "positive, but it's not enough," Mr. Canete said. "There's a gap of 1 degree Celsius."
That is why the U.S., European and other countries, including small-island states that risk drowning if temperatures rise more, have been banking on a regular review process to the Paris deal. Every five years, governments would check progress on the 2-degree goal and if necessary, draw up new emission targets.
"They can resubmit the same or a new one, more ambitious," Mr. Canete said.
But at the G-20 summit in Antalya, Turkey, some countries, led by India and Saudi Arabia, blocked any reference to such a review process in the final statement -- startling negotiators, including Mr. Canete, who thought the plan had been widely accepted.
"In our [most recent] meetings . . . I didn't hear anybody raising" objections to the review process, Mr. Canete said.
Beyond the review process, negotiators in Paris will have to nail down a host of other elements that will determine the effectiveness of any agreement. The U.S. has resisted making national emissions cuts legally binding, since that would require the deal to be ratified by Congress, where it would likely be blocked. Mr. Canete is nevertheless optimistic that the U.S., even under a Republican administration, would implement its promised cuts.
The big number of outstanding issues -- and the challenge of getting 195 countries to agree to each of them -- is the biggest threat to arriving at a credible deal, Mr. Canete said. "A single country has the power, the ability or the capacity to block an agreement under a COP. The risk is that to accommodate everybody the agreement loses the level of ambition."
Money is another clash point between rich and poor countries. At the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference, developed nations promised to come up with $100 billion in annual financing by 2020 to help developing countries buy the technologies needed to reduce their emissions and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of global warming.
While groups like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development say governments and private investors are on track to meet that target, poorer states have questioned their accounting.
Mr. Canete said he would push EU members to block a deal that can't deliver the necessary emission cuts. "Just to sign an agreement for the sake of having a piece of paper on the table is not useful."

Full text:   Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund defends his call for government probes into Exxon Mobil's climate research based on inaccurate reporting in InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, by saying there is no other way to get the facts (Letters, Nov. 14). Yet the facts are readily available.
Beginning in the 1970s, company scientists began examining the question of anthropogenic contributions to climate change. Our company's work to help understand the role that man-made CO2 emissions play in climate fluctuations has continued unabated for four decades.
There are many aspects to consider in assessing the wide range of predictions on how serious the impact of increasing amounts of anthropogenic emissions might be in the future. These include various policy proposals to drive investment to combat climate change and the economic and social effects of those efforts, not to mention the pace of technology development.
While we have worked to advance the scientific underpinnings, collaborating with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and with research institutions such as MIT, Princeton and Stanford, we have also worked to advance a responsible policy framework for addressing the risks of climate change. We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant thoughtful action.
At times our policy advocacy has put us at odds with some in the climate-activist community. For example, we opposed the Kyoto Protocol because it would have exempted two-thirds of the world's emissions while doing grave damage to the U.S. economy. The U.S. Senate felt similarly; in 1997 it voted 95-0 to oppose this ineffective and costly policy proposal.

Full text:   Bjorn Lomborg's "Gambling the World Economy on Climate" (op-ed, Nov. 17) argues that emissions reductions are bad investments because of cost. But he never considers the value of the asset we are buying. Smart policy should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of possible actions and pursue those that yield the strongest return for society. Mr. Lomborg became famous advocating for this approach, but now he seems to forget his own lesson.
Our research shows that the climate is a valuable asset and paying billions to prevent it depreciating is a bargain. Our recent study published in Nature shows rising temperatures could cost 23% of global GDP by 2100 -- and that there is a 50-50 chance it could be worse. Mr. Lomborg rightly advocates for lifting up the world's poor, but we calculate that failing to address climate change will cost the poorest 40% of countries three-quarters of their income. By 2030 alone, we show that climate change could reduce annual global GDP by $5 trillion.
These are only the effects of temperature on productivity. Other impacts will add to the price tag. For example, we estimate avoiding intensification of tropical cyclones from climate change is worth about $10 trillion. And warming could increase conflict roughly 30% in 2050; what is that worth?
Mr. Lomborg says that $730 billion a year in 2030 is too much to pay to avoid many trillions in losses. This math is easy.

Mr. Lomborg shows the conceit and utter disregard of the climate bureaucrats for an honest cost/benefit analysis, detailing estimated expenditures of hundreds of billions globally to reduce carbon dioxide emissions projected to prevent a temperature rise of a mere fraction of a Fahrenheit degree in the next 80 years.
He also sheds light on the motivation of those who advocate for global control of energy generation. The U.N.'s Christiana Figueres and others, such as the Bolivian delegation, aspire to destroy capitalism, because freedom in the marketplace reflects individual freedom of thought, expression and action. That won't do when the goal is to establish world government, based on the dictates of the self-selected intellectually and morally superior, who not only know what's best for all, but why some are more equal than others.
The latest draft of the agreement for the Paris climate summit includes an "International Tribunal of Climate Justice," a climate court modeled after the U.N. International Court of Justice at the Hague. Secretary of State Kerry says that a U.N. emissions-reduction agreement would be legally binding on the U.S., but would not require Senate approval. Watch your freedoms as a U.S. citizen evaporate as quickly as a puddle of water on a hot July day when your state or community is judged to be in violation of emission goals set, not by a market-based cost/benefit analysis, but by the wisdom of international bureaucrats.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted Tuesday to strike down regulations aimed at cutting carbon emissions from power plants, the first congressional action against President Barack Obama's climate-change agenda.
The move comes less than two weeks before a global conference on climate change in Paris, where Mr. Obama hopes to show U.S. leadership.
In two votes, the Senate passed measures nullifying recently completed Environmental Protection Agency rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants.
Citing the rules' importance to public health and climate change, the White House said Tuesday that Mr. Obama would veto the measures. Congress likely doesn't have the votes to override such a veto.
Congressional Republicans nonetheless hope to send a symbolic message sowing doubt among other nations that Mr. Obama will be able to take decisive steps to address the issue of climate change.
One of the EPA rules calls for a 32% cut in carbon emissions from hundreds of mainly coal-fired power plants across the U.S. by 2030 based on 2005 emissions levels. The second rule sets new standards for power plants not yet built, and that could make it difficult to build future power plants fueled by coal.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and other lawmakers from coal-dependent states argued that the EPA rules are killing U.S. jobs without any sizable impact on climate change. "Their effect on global carbon levels? Essentially a rounding error," Mr. McConnell said Tuesday. "Their effect on poor and middle-class families? Potentially devastating."
Mr. Obama says that even if the regulations by themselves won't slow climate change, they show U.S. leadership on the global stage leading up to United Nations climate negotiations set to begin Nov. 30.

Full text:   In his "In Exxon War, Bamboozled by Greenies" (Business World, Nov. 7), Holman Jenkins, Jr. accuses me and the organization I lead, the Environmental Defense Fund, of turning our backs on our core philosophy of coalition-building because I endorsed a federal probe of Exxon Mobil. I did not call for a criminal investigation, as Mr. Jenkins claims, and the company's opposition to climate solutions isn't the issue here.
I called for a civil fact-finding probe because I am troubled by detailed news reports which strongly suggest that since the late 1970s Exxon Mobil's staff scientists have been privately briefing top executives on the realities of climate change, and that the executives have been making business decisions based on those realities, while spending tens of millions of dollars to actively mislead the public and investors. The public deserves to know the facts. I took the rare step of endorsing a civil probe because the stakes are extraordinarily high, and I don't see any other way to get those facts on the table.
The EDF's commitment to corporate partnerships, which has led to groundbreaking alliances with McDonald's, FedEx, Wal-Mart, AT&T and many others, gives us a responsibility to speak up when this kind of serious allegation surfaces. Mr. Jenkins accuses me of joining a rush to judgment and dismisses my public statement which made clear that is not the case. But I meant what I said. We don't have all the facts about what Exxon knew, and we are not prejudging what happened.

Full text:   CALGARY, Alberta -- Canadian oil producers, pummeled by the prolonged slump in oil prices and a string of political setbacks, now face another challenge: higher carbon taxes.
The nation's oil-sands developers have been hit particularly hard by lower oil prices, because they are among the most expensive oil plays in the world.
Already facing a corporate tax hike and the possibility of higher royalty payments in Alberta -- the province richest in oil sands -- the industry was dealt another blow by the Obama administration's rejection last week of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was designed to transport oil-sands output to Gulf Coast refineries.
All major oil-sands operators in recent weeks posted losses or steep declines in profit for the most-recent quarter, as shrinking revenue outpaced cost cuts. Some global giants are rethinking future development. Late last month Royal Dutch Shell PLC shelved an 80,000-barrel-a-day project, following similar moves by Total SA of France and Norway's Statoil ASA.
Now, ahead of a United Nations climate-change conference in Paris starting Nov. 30, oil companies await the details of moves -- including possible new taxes on carbon -- pledged by new governments in Ottawa and Alberta to rein in greenhouse-gas emissions, making the oil sands a global test case for climate policy.
"Canada's years of being a less-than-enthusiastic actor on the climate-change file are behind us," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who took office last week, said at a news conference on Oct. 20, the day after his Liberal Party won national elections. Mr. Trudeau promised to start working on a framework for regulating greenhouse-gas emissions within 90 days of the Paris summit.
Within weeks of taking power in May, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's government said it would double Alberta's existing tax on carbon emissions by 2017, and has committed to additional measures in time for the U.N. conference in Paris. Ms. Notley is expected to release details of the proposals later this month. Alberta pioneered carbon taxes in 2007 when it introduced a levy of 15 Canadian dollars ($11.37) a metric ton.
Oil sands are among the highest-intensity greenhouse-gas producers of any oil fields in the world. Production from the oil sands has been growing at a steady clip in recent years under previous provincial and federal governments that played down climate-change risks and ignored calls from environmental groups and opposition politicians for tougher rules on carbon-dioxide emissions.
Canada's environment ministry says the country's CO2 emissions have continued to rise over the past five years and are expected to hit 781 million metric tons a year by 2020 if no reduction measures are taken. While oil sands account for just a fraction of that total, it is one of the fastest-growing contributors to the release of these gases. The government's latest estimate projects oil sands-related emissions to nearly double to 103 million metric tons by 2020.
Mr. Trudeau's stance is a direct challenge to Canada's oil-sands industry, but the country's oil producers are divided on how best to cope with the push for stricter environmental regulations.
Some, including the nation's No. 1 oil producer, Suncor Energy Inc., say they accept the tougher rules as inevitable, and can use them to help burnish their environmental reputations. Others, such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. -- Canada's biggest natural-gas producer and a major oil-sands leaseholder -- are pushing back, warning the rules would make Canadian crude even less competitive.
The divide in the industry has surfaced in submissions by top energy companies to a government advisory panel of experts that will recommend new climate-policy measures in Alberta.
"The time is right for a higher level of ambition in carbon policy stringency in Alberta," Suncor said in its submission to the provincial panel.
Suncor Chief Executive Steve Williams has publicly championed new taxes on retail sales of energy such as electricity and gasoline, in addition to levies on large industrial emitters. "Every indication is that, on the road to Paris, Canada will start to take positions" to combat climate change, Mr. Williams told reporters late last month.
Canadian Natural said in its submission that it objects to higher carbon taxes and other new government-mandated policies, and has called for allowing oil and gas producers to focus on new technology to cut emissions.
Its 34-slide Power Point presentation to the Alberta panel lays out the competitive challenges facing the industry and warns that tinkering with policies that directly affect oil and gas producers "is very difficult and more often than not has unintended consequences." In a similar vein, oil-sands producer Husky Energy Inc. warns against making emission cuts deeper than in other countries such as the U.S.
"It would be politically suicidal for us to do a mea culpa and hang our neck out in a way that disadvantages the industry here," Husky CEO Asim Ghosh said on a recent conference call.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline Friday ends a seven-year saga with a declaration that the project is not in the national interest and would undermine U.S. global leadership in fighting climate change.
The permit denial, which was cheered by environmentalists and lambasted by the energy industry, capped a politically charged review of the oil project that had escalated into a broader debate on climate change, energy and the economy. In the end, the administration's decision likely will not have much impact on the industry's operations, and the White House said the rejection was important to bolster the country's credibility as the U.S. urges other nations to confront climate change.
President Barack Obama, who had signaled deep misgivings about the project as he pursued an expansive agenda aimed at combating climate change, said the pipeline ultimately took on an overinflated role in the country's political discourse.
"It became a symbol too often used as a campaign cudgel by both parties rather than a serious policy matter," Mr. Obama said at the White House. "And all of this obscured the fact that this pipeline would neither be a silver bullet for the economy, as was promised by some, nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others."
The project would not have lowered gas prices, improved energy security or made a meaningful long-term contribution to the economy, Mr. Obama said.
But Russ Girling, president and chief executive of TransCanada Corp., the company behind the project to move crude from Canada's oil fields to U.S. refineries, said the State Department's own reviews presented compelling evidence that Keystone XL would not significantly exacerbate greenhouse-gas emissions.
"Misplaced symbolism was chosen over merit and science. Rhetoric won out over reason," Mr. Girling said in a statement. "Today's decision deals a damaging blow to jobs, the economy and the environment on both sides of the border."
The permit application process, known as the "national interest determination," was supervised by the State Department, which considered several aspects of how the pipeline would affect the U.S., including its impact on the economy, environment and energy security. Secretary of State John Kerry delivered the final determination to the president Friday morning.
The administration's decision effectively kills the pipeline, at least for now. Mr. Girling has said his company was unlikely to abandon the project entirely. But he also told the Journal in an interview last month that TransCanada would consider writing off the $2.4 billion it has already spent on the project and letting it lie fallow if approval appears unlikely soon.
The Keystone XL pipeline would have moved as many as 830,000 barrels of oil a day, mostly from Canada's oil sands to Steele City, Neb., where it would have connected with existing pipelines to Gulf Coast refineries.
But as the fight over approval unfolded, Keystone became a symbol as much as a project. Environmental activists seized on it as a rallying point, portraying it as epitomizing the U.S.'s reliance on fossil fuels. That prompted a backlash from conservatives, who derided critics as opposing an economically valuable, job-creating project to appease a political interest group.
In recent months, activists on both sides speculated that Mr. Obama, caught in the middle, might simply decline to make a decision. Friday's move suggests the president ultimately concluded that a formal rejection would be a key part of his environmental legacy that also includes new rules on carbon emissions, fracking and water protection, which are being challenged in the courts.
The rejection sends a diplomatic message as the Obama administration works with other countries to complete a sweeping international climate agreement in Paris next month.
"America is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change," Mr. Obama said.
While the timing of the denial appeared aimed at strengthening the Obama administration's hand ahead of the Paris climate talks, a request by TransCanada this week to suspend its permit application also may have added to the sense of urgency in announcing a decision.
The company's desire to pause the application could have provided the Obama administration with an escape hatch to delay a decision until after the next president takes office in 2017. But White House officials made clear this week that Mr. Obama planned to act on the project and had no intention of handing it off to his successor.
TransCanada first applied for a permit with the State Department, which reviews cross-border pipeline projects, in September 2008. Since then, the Calgary, Alberta-based company has faced multiple setbacks in Washington and in Nebraska, where opposition from landowners and environmentalists repeatedly delayed the permitting process.
Despite the decision, Republicans could keep pushing the issue on Capitol Hill. Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.) has said Republicans likely will seek to attach language approving the pipeline to legislation that Congress must pass, such as a spending bill.
Reaction to the administration's decision broke down largely along party lines, with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) calling the rejection "sickening" and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev) saying that the president had stopped a "harmful project" and further cemented his environmental legacy.
The 2016 presidential candidates lined up along the same partisan fault lines, with Democratic contenders praising the president for tackling climate change and Republican candidates denouncing a move they said would cost thousands of jobs and harm the economy.

Full text:   Exxon Mobil Corp. has received a subpoena from the New York attorney general's office seeking information about the company's research on and response to climate change over several decades, the company said Thursday.
The investigation was confirmed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office, which declined further comment. The probe is focused on potential consumer and securities fraud stemming from Exxon's public statements on global warming.
The company is weighing how to respond, according to spokesman Alan Jeffers, who said Exxon has long disclosed information about the business risk of climate change in its reports to shareholders and regulators. The company is among the world's largest oil and gas producers.
"We unequivocally reject allegations that Exxon Mobil suppressed climate change research contained in media reports that are inaccurate distortions of Exxon Mobil's nearly 40-year history of climate research," Mr. Jeffers said in an emailed statement.
InsideClimate News, a nonprofit journalism organization and other news media have published reports since September detailing Exxon's early research on global warming in the 1970s and noting that the company later supported groups trying to raise questions about climate science.
"Exxon has said that it's inaccurate and yet they have not asked for any corrections," said Neela Banerjee, one of the authors of the InsideClimate series.
In recent years, Exxon has said the risks of climate change are real and should be addressed.

Abstract: The company has spent at least $2.5 billion on the Keystone project, which aims to move as many as 830,000 barrels of oil a day, mostly from Canada's oil-sands region, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with pipelines to Gulf Coast refineries. Led by author Bill McKibben, founder of the climate-change activist group 350.org, and with the help of Jane Kleeb, founder of the landowner's group Bold Nebraska, they portrayed Keystone and the carbon-heavy oil sands it would carry as incompatible with fighting climate change.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- When TransCanada Corp. applied to the U.S. State Department for permission to build the cross-border Keystone XL pipeline in 2008, it expected approval in two years or less.
But two years into the process, then-Sen. Mike Johanns, a Republican, saw opposition brewing in his home state of Nebraska, through which the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline was supposed to pass. He advised Russ Girling, TransCanada's chief executive, to change the pipeline's route to defuse a fight with environmentalists and landowners allied against the project.
Instead, TransCanada chose to plow ahead. "Honestly, in all my years in government, I've never seen such an enormous miscalculation," Mr. Johanns said earlier this year. "They made a lot of assumptions that this thing was going to skate right through the Obama administration."
On Wednesday, the State Department denied TransCanada's request earlier this week to suspend its permit application for Keystone -- a move that would have essentially punted the pipeline decision to after the 2016 elections. The Obama administration is widely expected to reject the proposed pipeline as soon as this week, ending a yearslong drama.
Interviews with more than two dozen people -- including current and former TransCanada executives and government officials -- suggest that the company fumbled its U.S. push for the pipeline by pursuing a politically naive public-relations strategy over the past seven years, and failing to play an aggressive role in shaping the pipeline debate.
TransCanada didn't open a Washington office until 2012, at least two years after the pipeline became a national issue. Before that, Paul Elliot, its only full-time staff lobbyist for the pipeline in Washington, regularly commuted to the city from New York.
That doesn't mean a bolder approach would have clinched the U.S.'s approval. Many of those interviewed said the Obama administration politicized the process and sent TransCanada mixed signals.
"It was a very tough environment to be in." said Mike McCurry, a former White House press secretary who has consulted for TransCanada. "When you're being told by decision makers that they're going by the book and politics aren't going to be a factor, if you play the political game, you run the risk of alienating the folks at the career level who have the file."
The State Department has repeatedly denied that politics figured in the approval process. But Obama administration officials acknowledge Keystone has taken an unprecedented length of time.
Company executives say their decision to stick with the pipeline's original route made sense at the time because of an initial report by the State Department finding the pipeline's route in Nebraska environmentally safe. Company officials also argued that repeated delays by the U.S. government allowed climate activists to make Keystone a rallying point, prompting a backlash by conservatives that polarized the debate.
"There are lots of folks in Washington who are totally versed on how it works and what's necessary there," said TransCanada's Mr. Girling. "Our job is to build pipelines."
Many of those interviewed said TransCanada followed a playbook that no longer works in Washington, where regulatory approvals can get caught up in ideological conflicts. "I think there is a new world order in terms of these projects," said Michael Whatley, executive vice president of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a trade association that has worked with TransCanada. "You need to build an advocacy campaign into your budget, and you have to start this outreach early."
The company has spent at least $2.5 billion on the Keystone project, which aims to move as many as 830,000 barrels of oil a day, mostly from Canada's oil-sands region, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with pipelines to Gulf Coast refineries.
As the federal review wore on, Obama administration officials and many congressional Democrats grew more hostile to the project. Early opposition to the pipeline's route in Nebraska led to Mr. Obama's 2011 decision to delay the State Department review until a new route was selected.
That nearly two-year delay helped environmentalists. Led by author Bill McKibben, founder of the climate-change activist group 350.org, and with the help of Jane Kleeb, founder of the landowner's group Bold Nebraska, they portrayed Keystone and the carbon-heavy oil sands it would carry as incompatible with fighting climate change.
In 2012, with Keystone a focus of public and congressional attention and a presidential race in progress, TransCanada executives considered mounting a multimillion-dollar ad campaign to defend the project. But they feared their message would get lost, and didn't want to get involved in electoral politics.
"Others may disagree with this approach," said TransCanada spokesman James Millar. "But isn't hindsight a wonderful thing when you have not lived in the trenches like I have every day?"
In the past two years, the company has adopted a more aggressive tone and poured more money into U.S. lobbying and advertising, spending $3.6 million in 2014. In February, it launched ads to boost its credibility on clean-energy issues.
"There has been a shift in how these projects will be reviewed in the future," Mr. Girling said in an interview this year. "I think we're better positioned now than before."

Full text:   Poorer nations' demand that wealthier countries help bankroll their transition to cleaner energy has emerged as the biggest obstacle for world leaders seeking to reach an agreement on emissions at a summit that begins this month.
World leaders arrive in Paris in late November with the aim of negotiating an agreement to slash carbon-dioxide emissions beyond 2020. But many developing countries say highly industrialized nations haven't yet pledged enough to help them transition to lower-carbon energy or to prepare for the effects of a more adverse climate.
"Finance is a very big issue in this negotiation," said Todd Stern, the U.S. special envoy for climate change, in an interview.
The latest round of climate negotiations organized through the United Nations was meant to blur the line between highly industrialized, richer countries that have burned large amounts of fossil fuels for more than a century and the poorer, developing countries that still rely on burning more coal and oil to achieve rapid growth and lift hundreds of millions out of poverty.
Rather than assigning across-the-board reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, the Paris talks allow countries to set their own emissions targets based on their particular level of development. That approach will prevent the Paris accord from limiting global warming as much as officials had sought, but it may allow for a politically palatable deal that brings China and other big emerging markets to the table to limit emissions down the road.
Still, the split between richer and poorer countries persists in the area of finance: The participation of many developing countries -- including their decision on whether to sign on to the agreement next month -- is based on richer countries following through with plans to mobilize money.
"One of the pieces that is very, very critical for this process is to provide that transparent support to developing countries," said Christiana Figueres, head of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, in an interview in Washington.
The stated goal is for richer countries to kick in $100 billion a year of their own money and related private financing for developing nations by 2020. A report last month from the leading group of developed countries -- the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- estimated that more affluent countries delivered $61.8 billion in financing last year to help developing economies limit carbon emissions and fend off extreme weather and rising sea levels.
Ms. Figueres and other leading officials say the figures from the OECD show progress, but not all developing countries are satisfied.
"Those numbers haven't been consulted with or accepted by developing countries," said Ms. Figueres.
Paul Bledsoe, a former climate official in the Clinton White House and consultant in Washington, said "The big threat is that there's a bloc of countries that basically says, 'No, no, wait a second, we believe the whole climate-finance system is inadequate,' and they make a big demonstration, and they walk out of the meetings."

Full text:   In "This Child Doesn't Need a Solar Panel" (op-ed, Oct. 22), Bjorn Lomborg, a political scientist by training, presents readers with a false choice that pits investment in climate security against investments in food, water and health security.
Developing countries need affordable electricity to solve their problems. Without irrigation systems, food insecurity in poor countries creates a cycle of famine and poverty for one billion people globally. Without access to clean drinking water, disease and lost labor hours charge a high economic toll on nations that can ill afford it. Solar-powered technologies from Kyocera are a proven and cost-effective way to irrigate cropland and extract clean well water.
Solar power also helps improve education, enhancing political enfranchisement and supporting economic growth. The d.light company makes affordable, battery-connected solar-powered lamps used by 53 million people to light their homes at night so they can read. Solar power scales up and down easily without incurring additional infrastructure or environmental cost.
If Mr. Lomborg is concerned about global health, water and food security, then he should prioritize investments with environmental benefits and low infrastructure costs, like solar. The Pentagon recognizes that climate-change-induced environmental disasters will have a horrifying impact on the issues Mr. Lomborg cites and is investing in solar now.

The world's poorest, those who are most economically affected by "feel good" efforts to cut global greenhouse-gas emissions, are more concerned about education, health care and jobs than rising oceans.
It is wrong to keep poor people poor in order to keep tidewaters from creeping too high on Malibu beaches. Let's join Mr. Lomborg and listen to what those most in need of our compassion and assistance are telling us.

---
While a shrinking few continue to deny the scientific reality of climate change, far too many of the world's most impoverished peoples are already suffering from the changes to our warming world. Tragically, many now being hit by the effects of climate change are among the world's least fortunate and most vulnerable populations who have contributed very little to the greenhouse-gas pollution impacting their lives.
Problems like poverty, the refugee crisis and a lack of clean drinking water and sanitation are symptoms of our changing climate and must be addressed as such. As Pope Francis said in his recent encyclical: "There has been a tragic rise in the number of migrants seeking to flee from the growing poverty caused by environmental degradation."
We all have an obligation to take on global warming by ending fossil-fuel subsidies and investing in sensible climate strategies now. It's time for people of all faiths to demand the smart, ethical and affordable policies on climate change needed to secure the safety and prosperity of all of God's children.

Full text:   Corrections & Amplifications
Alan Blumberg is director of the Davidson Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology. An article on Wednesday about climate change research since superstorm Sandy incorrectly stated his title.
(WSJ Oct. 30, 2015)
Ben Horton came to New Jersey specifically to study sea-level rise and catastrophic storms, so superstorm Sandy seemed to him like a gift, albeit a grim one.
"There was so much interest in science explaining why Sandy caused so much damage late in the hurricane season," said Mr. Horton, a British native who is a professor of sea-level research at Rutgers University. "It provided a focus for us."
Three years since Sandy caused historic damage to the region, scientific learning and research on sustainability, climate change and coastal studies have had a renaissance. Tens of millions of state and federal dollars have flowed to projects pertaining to climate change, and interest among students to study the topics has been high at area universities since the storm made landfall on Oct. 29, 2012.
What has varied is the interest of state public officials to solicit and publicly embrace climate-change research.
States such as New York, California, Oregon and Washington have commissioned research on how sea-level rise can affect their communities, while North Carolina banned the studies from informing coastal policies in 2012.
New Jersey has fallen somewhere in the middle. State Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican running for president, has said that climate change is real and that governments should respond, but he sees no direct link between global warming and Sandy.
"No one has shown me any evidence that Sandy happened by climate change. The climate is changing all the time," said Mr. Christie, during a town-hall meeting earlier this month in New Hampshire.
State scientists and planning advocates argue climate change has fueled sea-level rise and storms such as Sandy to be more intense and frequent. They believe the administration should do more to include projections of rising seas into building codes and state policy.
"There are other states that are providing a more aggressive approach to working with communities to address sea level rise," said David Kutner, a planning manager at New Jersey Future, a land-use nonprofit.
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection spokesman said that sea-level rise predictions vary widely and the state relies on the best science available from federal officials.
Arguments over whether Sandy was caused by climate change amount to hairsplitting, and the Christie administration is moving ahead with resiliency projects that will build back the state stronger, a spokeswoman said.
Mr. Christie is expected to make remarks in New Jersey to commemorate the third anniversary of the storm on Thursday and to highlight progress made in recovery.
The congressional disaster aid bill passed after Sandy earmarked $309 million in federal funding for research pertaining to severe-storm prediction and response.
The results of that funding will be featured in a Washington, D.C., briefing scheduled for Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
The storm that did an estimated $70 billion in damage in New Jersey and New York acted as a catalyst to climate change-related research under way in the region.
Planning for the City University of New York's Science and Resilience Institute research consortium at Jamaica Bay had already started when the storm struck, but it received $3.6 million in federal Sandy funding in 2014. The Cuomo administration provided more than $7 million for its efforts, including climate change studies.
At Stony Brook University, state officials started the New York State Resiliency Institute for Storms and Emergencies to study sea-level rise and conduct other research to be incorporated into New York's planning for future storms.
At the private Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., researchers have used an estimated $6 million in funding from the federal government and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to better predict flooding caused by storms. Student researchers have grown to about 20 from none before Sandy, said Alan Blumberg, director of the school's Center for Maritime Systems.
And at New Jersey's largest public university, the Rutgers Climate Institute opened in 2013. A paper co-authored by Mr. Horton was referenced by President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address earlier this year.
Regardless of the arguments over climate change, New Jersey students are showing an interest in studying it. Jennifer Walker, a Rutgers doctoral student who grew up going to Stone Harbor, N.J., was prompted to focus her studies on sea-level rise after Sandy devastated her Jersey Shore town.
"I wanted to choose a career in research that I would have a personal connection to," said Ms. Walker, a 23-year-old New Brunswick resident. "I understood after Sandy how much a longer term context of sea-level rise is needed."

Bus Crash Kills
At Least 43 People
A collision between a cargo truck and a bus left at least 43 people dead and several seriously injured, in France's worst traffic accident in decades.
A bus carrying elderly passengers along a country road in southwestern France collided with a truck at 7:30 a.m. local time, authorities said, causing the vehicles to burst into flames.
TV images of the accident showed smoke rising from the charred shells of the two vehicles.
A truck and its trailer appeared in the opposite lane of traffic, where it was apparently struck by the oncoming bus.
The dead included the truck driver and his 3-year-old son, French authorities said. It wasn't clear whether 41 or 42 people died in the bus.
"We are deep in grief after this disaster," French President Francois Hollande said. He dispatched three ministers to the site of the accident near the village of Puisseguin in the southwest of France.
The accident occurred along a narrow winding road where vehicles moving in opposite directions are required to squeeze by each other.
The collision was the deadliest in France since a 1982 crash involving a busload of children.

CLIMATE
Developing Nations
Raise Climate Target
Developing nations facing some of the biggest threats from climate change are pressing rich countries to make a goal that has underpinned years of negotiations even tougher, highlighting the difficulty of reaching a global agreement this year.
While limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from the preindustrial age has long been the target, the group of poor African countries and low-lying nations say even that would be disastrous for them.
They seized on preparatory talks this week for the coming Paris climate-change summit to demand the world cap the increase at 1.5 degrees.
The disagreement is just one area in which quarreling between rich and poor nations is threatening to derail a new agreement. With little more than a month until it begins Nov. 30, negotiators worry about falling behind schedule.

Dalai Lama Joins Call
For Climate Action
The Dalai Lama said action against climate change was a question of "the survival of humanity," echoing recent statements by Pope Francis on the need to combat global warming.
The 80-year-old Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader made his remarks on Tuesday in the run-up to international talks aimed at slowing global warming set for December in Paris.
"This is not a question of one nation or two nations. This is a question of humanity affecting the whole world," the Dalai Lama said in a statement, adding that people are responsible for global warming.
The Dalai Lama spoke of the dangers global warming poses to Tibet. Some ecologists call the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau a "third pole" because of the environmental importance of its icy landscape.

Uber Driver Convicted
Of Raping Woman
An Indian court convicted a driver of raping a woman in a car booked through the Uber app in Delhi, a case that triggered a ban on ride-hailing services there. Shiv Kumar Yadav was found guilty of the December attack by a specially convened fast-track court designed to improve rape conviction rates. Sentencing is expected to be Friday, lawyers involved in the case said.
The woman attacked by the Uber driver began proceedings to sue Uber Technologies Inc. in the U.S. for negligence, saying it failed to carry out proper background checks. She later withdrew the case.
The Uber driver in Delhi pleaded not guilty to the charges, including kidnapping and endangering a woman's life while raping her. Mr. Yadav's lawyer D.K. Mishra said his client would appeal the verdict.

AUSTRALIA
Parliament to Pass
China Trade Deal
Australia's parliament is set to ratify a free-trade pact with China before the end of the year after the country's main opposition party dropped threats to scuttle the deal after securing safeguards for local workers.
Ending weeks of political acrimony, opposition leader Bill Shorten said Labor had struck an agreement with the conservative government on "satisfactory legal protections" to stop Chinese workers taking local jobs.
Proponents of the deal say it will be a boon for Australian commodities and service exports, by cutting tariffs and opening lucrative Chinese markets to Australian legal and insurance services, while also improving investment access for Chinese companies to Australia. China is Australia's biggest trade partner.
Coming in the wake of similar pacts with Japan and South Korea, the deal was seen by backers as proof that Canberra could broaden economic ties with Beijing without compromising its close military alliance with the U.S.

Xi Begins State Visit
Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived for his first state visit in the U.K., where he addressed Parliament and was greeted by members of the royal family and government officials.
The U.K. has sought to bolster trade with China and secure investments in infrastructure and other projects. Prime Minister David Cameron said the visit would unlock more than GBP 30 billion ($46.4 billion) of trade and investment deals, creating more than 3,900 jobs.

Full text:   OAKLAND, Calif. -- A proposal that could make this city a gateway for Utah coal to be shipped overseas has become a political flash point and put pressure on Gov. Jerry Brown, a former mayor known for his warnings on climate change, to come out against the project.
The proposed deal would grant four coal-producing counties in Utah rail access to a major commodities shipping terminal under development on city land, adjacent to the Port of Oakland, in exchange for a $53 million investment. City officials hope the redevelopment plan, on an old Army base, would bring thousands of jobs to a city that still has pockets of poverty and violence even as the region's tech sector booms and housing costs rise.
California ports in Stockton, Richmond and Long Beach export coal, but because of climate change and pollution concerns, such terminals have become highly contested on the West Coast. Environmentalists, who have defeated similar proposals in Oregon and Washington, have filed suit against the city, the project and developers. They are now calling on Mr. Brown, a Democrat, to speak out forcefully against coal being shipped through his former city.
"We are hopeful that he won't let his hometown of Oakland become a thoroughfare for dirty coal," said Jessica Dervin-Ackerman, conservation manager with the local chapter of the Sierra Club.
Mr. Brown declined to comment on the Oakland terminal. While he has sounded an alarm on climate change -- recently telling a Vatican symposium that 90% of the world's coal must remain unused to evade the perils of global warming -- as governor he has angered environmentalists by allowing the expansion of hydraulic fracturing in the state.
The master developer of the project is Phillip Tagami, a local businessman with close ties to Mr. Brown, who is credited with sparking a revitalization of the city's downtown when he served as mayor from 1999 to 2007. Mr. Brown is an investor with Mr. Tagami in an Oakland office building, according to an economic disclosure form filed by the governor. During Mr. Brown's gubernatorial administration, Mr. Tagami served as chairman of the state's Lottery Commission and as a member of its Medical Board; he left the administration in 2013.
The terminal, which would sit at the end of an existing track network, would be managed by Terminal Logistics Solutions, a company that is looking to partner with the Utah counties to export commodities including coal. "It is important to realize that this is an opportunity for Oakland," Jerry Bridges, the company's chief executive, told City Council members last month.
Mr. Tagami said he has spoken with Mr. Brown about the project, assuring him the terminal was designed to accept a wide variety of goods and has passed all necessary environmental reviews. The project, dubbed Oakland Global, is expected to bring in as much as $2.9 million in annual property taxes for the city, schools and other local governments, and has already created more than 2,300 jobs, he said.
"This is a local issue, and I think he respects it as that," Mr. Tagami said.
Utah backers say the state's coal burns more efficiently and has a lower sulfur content than coal from elsewhere, though experts say it doesn't necessarily emit less carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas produced by industry.
The state has sought new markets for its coal as energy companies and utilities in the U.S. have moved toward natural-gas plants and renewable forms of energy due to stricter federal pollution rules. While coal mining represents a fraction of Utah's economy, it has long been a source of jobs for counties in the central and southeastern part of the state. Statewide production of coal last year was near a 30-year low amid lower demand from Nevada and California. The Oakland terminal would give the Utah counties four million to five million tons of annual shipping capacity and access to overseas markets including Asia, where coal is in greater demand than in the U.S.
"This is what I call ultraclean coal, and it has a place in the world markets," said Jae Potter, a commissioner in Utah's Carbon County. "It has a place in developing countries."
But the idea of coal being shipped through Oakland has roiled politics in the city of about 414,000. Among those concerned is Mayor Libby Schaaf, a former aide to Mr. Brown. "We will not have coal shipped through our city," Ms. Schaaf wrote to Mr. Tagami in an email that was made public.
Oakland's City Council, which held a contentious hearing on the issue last month, is considering an ordinance to ban coal at the terminal. The Sierra Club argues coal dust has been linked to decreased lung capacity, childhood bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia, emphysema and heart disease. Mr. Bridges, of Terminal Logistics, told council members that any coal shipped through the city would be covered, eliminating the risk of coal dust.
Mr. Tagami said no restrictions should be imposed on which commodities the terminal can export and that doing so could harm the project's success.

Full text:   The International Transport Forum called Monday for global, enforceable regulations for the maritime industry to reduce carbon emissions by half over the next 35 years and to zero by 2080.
The ITF, a research arm of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the United Nations' International Maritime Organization should impose the standards across the maritime industry -- from container shipping lines to tanker operators -- and set up requirements including a carbon tax.
ITF analyst Olaf Merk recommended that the IMO, which regulates shipping emissions, submit regular reports on the industry's progress toward meeting the goals.
The call comes ahead the U.N.'s conference on climate change in December in Paris. The conference will bring together representatives from governments, nongovernmental organizations and U.N. agencies, with the goal of reaching a legally binding deal to limit global warming.
"It would be odd if countries are expected to adhere to emission targets but not the shipping sector, especially since it would be impossible to apportion shipping emissions to countries," the ITF said in a policy brief.
In 2012, the shipping industry contributed 800 million metric tons, or 2.2%, of world-wide carbon emission, according to the ITF.
Mr. Merk said the industry could take steps such as slowing ship speed, ensuring ships are fully used, designing more efficient ships and using alternative fuel sources to meet the targets. ITF recommended setting a carbon tax of $25 per metric ton of carbon dioxide.

Full text:   New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo hasn't always earned the praise of his fellow Democrats on issues central to the party, but on Thursday he added his voice to one of its core concerns -- climate change.
Appearing alongside former Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat, at an event at Columbia University, the governor said the state would take several major steps to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He called the measures a matter of survival, not political importance.
"Climate change is not about making society better. Climate change is an issue of society's sustainability," Mr. Cuomo said. "To deny that climate change is real is to defy reason."
At the news conference, the second climate-change event in which Mr. Cuomo has participated in less than a week, the governor said the state would sign the "Under 2 MOU," a memorandum of understanding among states, provinces and cities to keep the earth's average temperature from increasing two degrees Celsius by 2100.
The agreement is intended to demonstrate the commitment of those who sign it to the participants in the United Nations climate negotiations in Paris in December.
Mr. Cuomo also said the state would attempt to help build a broader North American carbon market with other states, including California and parts of Canada.
The governor's efforts in this area mark the third time recently in which Mr. Cuomo has turned his attention to national issues.
Last month Mr. Cuomo, alongside another Democratic, Vice President Joe Biden, said he would seek to give New York the highest minimum wage in the country. And in the past week, the governor has repeatedly advocated for national gun-control legislation, saying congressional Democrats should threaten to shut down the federal government over the issue.
Though climate change itself hasn't been a central focus of his administration, Mr. Cuomo's first term was marked by the governor's deliberations over high-volume hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a practice Mr. Cuomo's administration ultimately decided it wouldn't permit in New York.
Still, environmentalists found cause for concern with some elements of the governor's plans. While praising Mr. Cuomo's commitment to the climate change, the executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, Peter Iwanowicz, said the plans lacked specifics.
"What is still not clear, however, is whether the governor's goals are fully appreciated within his administration or what his plans are to achieve them," Mr. Iwanowicz said.

Full text:   LONDON -- The chief executives of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp. laid out contrasting visions this week for reducing fossil-fuel emissions, illustrating a divide between American and European energy companies ahead of a United Nations climate-change summit.
Rex Tillerson, CEO of U.S.-based Exxon, said Wednesday that innovation, free markets and competition were the best tools for curbing emissions. His remarks came a day after Ben van Beurden, chief of Anglo-Dutch giant Shell, said technology wouldn't be enough to bring about emissions cuts, and that governments needed to step in.
Both executives were speaking here at the Oil and Money conference, co-hosted by Energy Intelligence and the International New York Times.
The differing messages show that the oil industry hasn't come up with a unified response to climate change, even as its leaders become increasingly vocal about it in the run-up to the U.N. summit in Paris. Nearly 200 countries are expected to participate in the Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 meeting, which is designed to hammer out a way to reduce carbon emissions enough to slow climate change.
Messrs. Tillerson and van Beurden agreed on many issues, including that renewable-energy sources like solar can't meet the demands of a quickly industrializing world with a growing population. Both also would back putting a price tag on carbon emissions, an idea expected to be discussed in Paris, but Mr. Tillerson's support was more qualified.
Mr. van Beurden, like many of European energy executives, was more explicit in calling on governments to intervene, and "take the opportunity to put a price on carbon." "By taking the costs of tackling climate change and air pollution into account, carbon-pricing systems will drive the right behavior of consumers and producers," Mr. van Beurden said.
Mr. Tillerson took a different stance, saying technological advances launched the American shale boom, producing an abundance of natural gas that has helped curb U.S. emissions.
Those reductions, he said, were made without a U.S. policy on carbon pricing. Mr. Tillerson said he would accept a carbon tax if it was "revenue neutral," which, according to Exxon's website, means it would be "offset by tax reductions in other areas."
The divergence between American and European energy executives in their approach to climate change has played out elsewhere this year.
The chiefs of the biggest European oil companies signed an open letter in June calling for a carbon-pricing system to be instituted globally. Mr. van Beurden, who helped coordinate the letter, said American companies were invited to join, but declined.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents hundreds of U.S. oil and gas companies, including Exxon, Chevron Corp., and European companies like Shell, didn't sign the letter.
American companies don't plan to participate in meetings next week in Paris among European energy companies including Shell, BP PLC and French oil giant Total SA and state-oil companies from Saudi Arabia and Mexico to discuss climate-change initiatives.

U.N. Council Urges
Foreign Role in Probe
The United Nations Human Rights Council called for foreign judges and prosecutors to take part in Sri Lankan efforts to try those accused of crimes during and after the country's civil war.
U.N. investigators last month issued a report detailing "egregious violations" by both sides in the decadeslong conflict, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians, torture and rape of detainees, and extrajudicial killings.
The compromise resolution passed by the council was backed by Sri Lanka's government as well as by the U.S. Colombo has been eager to ensure that domestic authorities are in charge of investigations and prosecutions.

INDIA
Government Makes
Pledge on Emissions
India pledged to reduce the intensity of its carbon emissions and boost the share of electricity produced from sources other than fossil fuels to 40% by 2030, making it the final major economy to submit a target for a global climate pact.
The world's third-largest carbon polluter filed its climate action plan to the U.N. climate secretariat late Thursday, the deadline for pledges before a December conference in Paris, where governments are supposed to adopt a landmark deal to fight climate change.
The government said it would cut the rate of emissions relative to gross domestic product by 33%-35% by 2030 from 2005 levels. It said India has already reduced its carbon intensity by 12% since 2005.
The carbon intensity goal will allow India's emissions to grow as its economy expands but at a lower rate than now.

CUBA
Delegations Fail to
Resolve Direct Flights
The U.S. and Cuba are continuing work on re-establishing direct scheduled commercial flights, a State Department official said, though it isn't likely technical and regulatory challenges can be overcome for services to be launched this year.
A U.S. delegation met with Cuban counterparts in Havana this week for two days of technical consultations.
The Obama administration has been exploring an informal arrangement that would allow fliers to book flights direct with airlines rather than via package tour operators, despite the decades-old congressional ban.

Full text:   SYDNEY -- BHP Billiton, the world's biggest mining company, says a global agreement on climate-change action would slow but not stop demand growth for most of the commodities it produces.
Revealing projections for the first time as December's Paris Climate Conference nears, BHP Chief Commercial Officer Dean Dalla Valle assured investors in London Tuesday that the company has "stress-tested" its global resources business, which includes coal mines and oil fields.
The test: Could BHP withstand policy shifts that would follow an agreement limiting carbon emissions to cap global average temperatures at no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels?
The conclusion, according to the BHP report: "Even in an orderly or rapid shift to a 2-degree world, we forecast growth in long-term demand for most of our commodities."

Full text:   President Barack Obama's appearance at the United Nations this week is essentially his last opportunity to use the high-profile global platform to press his foreign-policy agenda, which is facing new challenges as he enters his final year in office.
Increasingly complex dynamics in a volatile Middle East will test Mr. Obama, while he tries to advance his longer-term policy goals on issues such as global development and climate change.
Russia's more aggressive posture in Syria and Iraq is overshadowing Mr. Obama's three days in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. On Monday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to meet with President Vladimir Putin for the first time in more than two years.
The president is also grappling with finding a U.S. role in a global migrant crisis spawned by Syria's civil war.
He is set to address the General Assembly on Monday, a speech that will serve as a road map for how he intends to approach the remaining 16 months of his term. He is expected to appear again next autumn but will have only a few months remaining in office.
Mr. Putin also is scheduled to address the world body on Monday, and the Middle East will be central to the U.S. and Russian leaders' high-stakes talks.
But Mr. Obama's schedule in New York, from Sunday to Tuesday, reflects a president looking to make strides in other policy areas. On Sunday, he addressed a U.N. meeting on global development concerns.
Mr. Obama urged other wealthy nations to contribute more to such issues, particularly the refugee crisis.
"We suffer no illusions of the challenges ahead. But we understand this is something that we must commit ourselves to," Mr. Obama said. "Because in doing so, we recognize that our most basic bond -- our common humanity -- compels us to act."
He said global development issues will be part of his work after he leaves office in January 2017, and he used a speech on Sunday on global development to push another priority, saying "development is threatened by climate change."
On Monday, Mr. Obama also will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The intent of the meeting, for the White House, is to further Mr. Obama's push on climate change.
The White House also announced Mr. Obama will meet with Cuban President Raul Castro on Tuesday, their first since the U.S. and Cuba formally restored diplomatic relations in July. Mr. Castro is attending the U.N. General Assembly for the first time.
Mr. Obama is hoping to advance U.S.-Cuba relations to the point of where he makes a trip to the island nation himself next year.
The diplomatic thaw with Cuba represents one of Mr. Obama's foreign-policy accomplishments. Another, a nuclear deal with Iran reached in July, isn't likely to be followed by a meeting with that country's leaders, administration officials said
Mr. Obama will also meet on Monday with President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan.

What to Expect on Monday
-- Brazil's Dilma Rousseff, President Barack Obama, China's Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and France's Francois Hollande address the General Assembly. Cuba's Raul Castro is also scheduled to speak, in his first assembly address; he is set to meet with Mr. Obama on Tuesday.
-- President Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meet for the third time this year as they seek to strengthen economic and strategic ties in the face of an increasingly assertive China.
-- A heads-of-state lunch hosted by U.N. Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon could see the first interaction between Messrs. Obama and Putin since a brief encounter in November, ahead of a much-anticipated 5 p.m. summit. Iran won't attend the luncheon.
-- President Obama called a 3 p.m. meeting to advance the U.S. push to increase the U.N.'s force of peacekeepers.
-- Messrs. Obama and Putin are set to meet at 5 p.m., as the Russian leader stakes out an assertive and agenda-shaping policy in the Middle East.
-- On Monday evening, foreign ministers from Iran and the six countries that negotiated the nuclear deal will meet for the first time since the July 14 agreement to chart out implementation.

Full text:   UNITED NATIONS -- The messages from world leaders and celebrities gathered here this weekend centered on an ambitious idea: Nations need to tackle 17 goals, including eradicating poverty and controlling climate change, to sustain a better future for the planet and its population.
The cost is $3 trillion and the deadline 2030.
The U.N.'s Sustainable Development Summit kicked off on Friday with 154 countries attending and opening remarks by Pope Francis, a song by Shakira and a call to action by Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai. It closed on Sunday when President Barack Obama spoke, dismissing skeptics who warn that the U.N.'s global development goals are too broad and costly.
Mr. Obama added his own warning, saying that if the goals are to be implemented, nations need to confront three threats: bad governance, inequality and climate change.
"For peace to have meaning it must be translated to bread, rice, health and education," Mr. Obama said.
Some of the goals are easier to achieve, experts say, such as eradicating extreme poverty and improving sanitation. Since the year 2000, when similar goals were set by the U.N., the number of people living in extreme poverty has been reduced by half.
The more challenging changes will be the most costly ones, such as climate-change regulations, and securing women's rights, for instance in cases of child marriage.
Although 193 countries have adopted the goals, they aren't legally binding and there is no system in place to hold governments accountable if they ignore the recommendations. Some independent observers are worried that countries will pick and choose among the goals and thus jeopardize the project's sustainability.
"The key to the success of these goals is an integrated approach," said Lucilla Spini, head of science programs at International Council for Science, who participated in the conference. "You need to have a comprehensive look. You can't pick one without the other, it won't work."
The U.N. developed the goals over the past three years with significant input from member states and private-sector and nongovernment organizations.
Funding will be another major challenge for developing nations that will mostly have to rely on donated funds through private sector or wealthier countries. Mr. Obama reiterated the U.S.'s commitment to the developing world and highlighted that investing in infrastructure in Africa would enable it to fulfill its development potential and benefit the world.
China's President Xi Jinping said his country would invest $2 billion in developing countries and set up an additional $12 billion fund, mostly for Africa, by 2030.
Other world leaders drew connections between domestic challenges and meeting these goals. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his priority was eradicating extreme poverty. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said extreme poverty, persecution and war had flooded Europe with refugees and migrants.
"Each and every one of us should work and must work to implement the agenda, so that people all over the world can live a life of dignity," Ms. Merkel said.

The Pope in America: Pope Ends Visit on a Conciliatory Note --- Sidestepping fiery rhetoric, pontiff urges dialogue in message to a divided country

Full text:   PHILADELPHIA -- During his landmark six-day visit to the U.S., Pope Francis used a soft sell to convey a conciliatory message on topics such as immigration, climate change and inequality, setting aside the fiery rhetoric that had polarized the U.S. faithful, church leaders and politicians before his arrival.
The pope largely glossed over divisive issues, staying on safer ground as he preached a message of dialogue to a deeply divided country. As a result, he deprived both liberals and conservatives of sound bites they might have employed to advance their respective agendas.
"He helped us to see that this polarization that exists in our society, certainly among our politicians and even within the church, this isn't the way we ought to be," said Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas of Tucson.
Before his arrival, the pope's strong language on capitalism, social justice and climate change had made him a sharply divisive figure. Liberals championed his defense of the environment and denunciation of economic inequality, while conservatives blasted his rhetoric on the free-market system and lamented his softer approach to moral issues such as divorce.
As recently as July, the pope blamed many of the world's ills on "corporations, loan agencies, certain 'free trade' treaties, and the imposition of measures of 'austerity' that always tighten the belt of workers and the poor." He described money as "the dung of the devil."
But he left that language behind on his arrival in the U.S., making little reference to capitalism except to laud the "spirit of enterprise."
In his speech before Congress, he spoke about progress in poverty reduction and the potential for technology to curb man-made harm to the environment. He didn't repeat his call in his June encyclical on the environment to combat global warming by reducing use of fossil fuels.
The pope's references to immigration consisted of homespun appeals to the immigrant experience -- including his own, as the son of an Italian who moved to Argentina -- urging his audience to identify with the hopes of Latin American migrants coming north in search of a better life and asking: "Is this not what we want for our own children?"
Even when appealing to the liberal agenda, he was subtle. In the congressional address he paid tribute to American heroes including Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. But he also celebrated Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker movement, and Thomas Merton, a poet and Cistercian monk who championed interreligious dialogue and nuclear disarmament.
He trod lightly over sensitive ethical questions such as same-sex marriage, abortion and divorce.
In a speech to U.S. bishops in Washington, he warned against the "temptation to give in to fear, to lick one's wounds, to think back on bygone times and to devise harsh responses to fierce opposition."
"Harsh and divisive language does not befit the tongue of a pastor, it has no place in his heart," the pope told the bishops.
That was a clear call for the American bishops to shift away from their approach under St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, who encouraged a more confrontational attitude on the most widely contested church teachings.
The pope did send the bishops important signals of support in their struggle with the Obama administration over the contraception mandate in the health law, and in looming conflicts over whether the U.S. Supreme Court's July ruling recognizing a right to same-sex marriage will require Catholic institutions to hire or extend employee benefits to same-sex spouses.
The pope used his first speech on U.S. soil, delivered to President Barack Obama, to warn Americans to "preserve and defend [religious] freedom from everything that would threaten or compromise it." The next day, he paid a surprise visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor, whose demands for a "conscience" exemption to the contraception mandate have made them heroines in the bishops' religious-freedom campaign.
"His messages on religious freedom have been very, very welcome," said Archbishop William E. Lori, chairman of the U.S. bishops' conference's committee on religious freedom. "That's going to help because his witness to faith is so credible and people are so open to what he has to say."
When asked why the pope didn't issue stronger statements against same-sex marriage, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the pope "avoided particular polemics or discussion because he comes [with] a positive message."
Meanwhile, the pope's major opportunity to address ordinary Americans -- a prime-time telecast at a celebration of the family Saturday evening -- gave him the chance to put forth a passionate defense of the traditional family as a monogamous union of a man and a woman.
But when the pope spoke, he entirely ignored those topics. He gave the most relaxed address of the visit, mixing in jokes about mothers-in-law. "Families have difficulties, families quarrel, and sometimes plates can fly," he said. "But the family is like a factory of hope."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and China will announce steps in their efforts to combat climate change, including a pledge by China to begin by 2017 a program to cap some emissions and put a price on carbon, senior Obama administration officials said Thursday.
The announcements Friday will detail their strategies for reaching emissions targets, the officials said, and aim to bolster efforts to complete an international accord to reduce global carbon-dioxide emissions, which is meant to be wrapped up in December.
Chinese President Xi Jinping's decision to put a price on national CO2 emissions with a cap-and-trade system would mark the first time China has launched such an initiative.
Obama administration officials said the emissions-trading system would encompass sectors that produce a substantial amount of air pollution, including the paper, steel and cement industries.
Chinese officials have said they aimed to introduce a national emissions-trading program by 2017, following on programs in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
The plan to be announced Friday would represent an evolution from these regional test programs, and mark a significant policy undertaking by the Chinese, U.S. officials said.
Asked about a potential climate deal late Thursday, Lu Kang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, declined to give details of what the two presidents might announce.
Friday's expected announcements come after months of discussions among U.S. and Chinese officials, as the Obama administration tries to build momentum ahead of United Nations climate-change negotiations in Paris later this year.
The announcements were expected to include domestic policy proposals from each country, climate-related finance commitments and what officials called a "common vision" for the international agreement. China also will announce a significant contribution to finance efforts in developing countries, they said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- In the first-ever address by a pontiff to a joint meeting of Congress, Pope Francis urged a divided legislature -- and nation -- to "confront every form of polarization" in seeking solutions to some of society's most pressing problems.
In an hour-long speech Thursday delivered in English, the pope urged lawmakers to take action to protect the environment, welcome immigrants and reduce economic inequality. The message challenged some Republican positions on those issues, especially immigration, a topic that has sharply divided Congress as well as candidates for president.
His address, though, was clearly calibrated for his audience, which welcomed him with an excitement and warmth unusual in the Capitol. His rhetoric was softer than what he often employs on these issues -- language that has earned him particular criticism in the U.S.
"I too am a son of this great continent, from which we have all received so much and toward which we share a common responsibility," he said.
The Argentine pope, who later in the day traveled to New York for the next leg of his six-day tour, lamented economic inequality and told the audience of senators, representatives and Supreme Court justices to be more accepting of immigrants, combat pollution and abolish the death penalty -- all positions more popular with Democrats. Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D., N.Y.) let out a loud whoop and rose from her seat after the comments on capital punishment.
But Pope Francis -- who has scorned money as the "dung of the devil" and rejected laissez-faire economic policies, which he says rely on faith in a "deified market" -- eschewed such harsh language Thursday. Instead, he echoed defenders of capitalism by stating that the "harnessing of the spirit of enterprise" is an essential element in the "creation and distribution of wealth."
Though he has written of an "exponentially" growing gap between rich and poor, he struck a more optimistic tone, saying that "much has been done in these first years of the third millennium to raise people out of extreme poverty."
Pope Francis didn't read the strongest words on the subject in his prepared text: a warning that politics "cannot be a slave to the economy and finance." According to the Vatican spokesman, the omission was accidental and the Vatican would publish the missing words in the official text of the speech.
The pope addressed immigration in a less confrontational way than he has done in Europe, where he has denounced indifference to the fate of migrants who have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean. He instead appealed to the foreign heritage of most of his listeners, identifying himself as the "son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants."
"On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life," he said. "Is this not what we want for our own children?"
Later in New York, Pope Francis presided over a service at St. Patrick's Cathedral. He began his remarks by expressing sorrow for the deadly stampede in Mecca on Thursday, and in his homily praised Catholic nuns, drawing applause. He also referred to the Catholic priest sex-abuse scandal, saying the clergy "suffered greatly in the not-distant past by having to bear the shame of some of your brothers who harmed and scandalized the Church in the most vulnerable of her members."
In his Washington address, the pope omitted any specifics in his remarks on the environment, one of the pope's best-known and most controversial causes -- including his earlier call to combat climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels -- and spoke only generally of the need to "avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity."
The pope reserved his strongest rhetoric for a condemnation of the arms industry, whose profits he said were "drenched in blood, often innocent blood."
In several cases, the pontiff touched only delicately on sensitive areas. In an apparent reference to same-sex marriage, he expressed his "concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without." Republicans as well as many U.S. church leaders have called on the pope to speak more boldly on issues such as homosexuality and abortion.
He repeated the call of previous popes and U.S. Catholic bishops for abolition of the death penalty and then hinted at his own more radical proposal, to end life imprisonment. A "just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation," he said.
The presence of the popular pope inspired a rare show of bipartisanship in the Capitol, especially among the one-third of lawmakers who are Catholic, including House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), both of whom appeared elated to see the pontiff. Other Catholics in the audience included Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and Chief Justice John Roberts.
After the speech, Democrats focused on the policy challenges posed by the pope, while Republicans sought to play down their legislative disagreements with him.
"The pontiff reaffirmed that we are in a time of crisis: The moment to act on climate change is now," said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.)
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) noted the pope's decision Wednesday to pay an unscheduled visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order that operates nursing homes. The Vatican spokesman said the visit was a "sign of support" for the nuns' demands, so far unsuccessful, for a conscience exemption to the contraception mandate in the federal health law.
Before leaving the Capitol, Pope Francis appeared on a balcony to greet the enormous crowds outside, who erupted in cheers. Mr. Boehner, standing beside him, seemed overcome with emotion.
Speaking in his native Spanish, Pope Francis asked the crowd for their prayers, adding that nonbelievers were welcome to send him "good wishes."
He then closed with a few words in English: "God bless America."
The pope later met with homeless people at Washington's St. Patrick's Church, where he offered consolation for their "unjust and painful situations."
The pope will address the United Nations General Assembly on Friday.

Trump Not a Believer
In Climate Change
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he doesn't believe in climate change and that measures to fight it would "imperil the companies in our country."
The New York real-estate developer said in a CNN interview Thursday that bad floods and other abnormal weather patterns have happened in the past, and the media is fixated too much on the issue.
"You can't watch the news anymore. It's always weather," said Mr. Trump, who added China hasn't done anything to address climate change.
"I believe in clean air. Immaculate air," Mr. Trump said. "But I don't believe in climate change."

STATE DINNER
Obama, Xi to Dine
On Lamb, Lobster
After what's expected to be a tense day of talks Friday on topics including cyber and maritime security, Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama will dig into Colorado lamb, Maine lobster and other dishes incorporating American and Chinese culinary traditions at an elaborate state dinner.
Expect business leaders, politicians and some celebrities to be at the dinner, though the White House was tight-lipped Thursday about who would be among the about 210 invited guests. An official list will be released Friday.
Lee Daniels, director of "The Butler," a movie loosely based on the life of a former White House staffer, said earlier this week that he'd be among the guests. Pop singer Ne-Yo, who has said his father is of African American and Chinese descent, will provide entertainment after dinner.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Pope Francis, during a day wrapped in ceremonial fanfare for the first public events of his landmark U.S. visit, challenged America's political and Catholic leaders, bringing a pointed yet conciliatory message to a country embroiled in debates over climate change, immigration, gay marriage and religious freedoms.
On each issue and at each stop on Wednesday -- from the White House to Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception to a speech to U.S. Catholic bishops -- the pope urged dialogue over opposing views, while standing firm on the Church's moral teachings.
He even waded into a fraught legal struggle between Catholic institutions and the federal government by paying an unplanned afternoon visit to an order of nuns. Pope Francis visited the Little Sisters of the Poor in what his spokesman called a "sign of support" for their demands, so far unsuccessful, for a conscience exemption to the contraception mandate in the health-care law.
By the end of a day that included cheering crowds as he paraded along the National Mall in his open-air popemobile, Pope Francis had both defended and challenged the positions of Democratic and Republican politicians -- and even U.S. bishops.
He endorsed climate-change initiatives President Barack Obama and fellow Democrats support and many Republicans oppose, saying "it seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to our future generation."
"When it comes to the care of our 'common home,' we are living at a critical moment of history," the 78-year-old pontiff said.
The pope's remarks, delivered in English, also gave credence to GOP arguments in Congress and on the campaign trail that some of Mr. Obama's core policies infringe on Americans' religious freedoms, such as his support for the Supreme Court ruling in favor of gay marriage.
A "truly tolerant and inclusive" society respects Catholics' "deepest concerns and their right to religious liberty," the pope said, noting the church's rejection of "every form of unjust discrimination," a phrase found in the Catechism of the Church in regard to "homosexual persons."
The pope arrived in Washington on Tuesday, following a visit to Cuba. He will address a joint session of Congress Thursday morning -- the first pontiff to do so. Later in the week, he travels to New York, where he will address the United Nations General Assembly. He closes his trip with a visit to Philadelphia over the weekend, including a Mass on Sunday expected to draw more than a million pilgrims.
The Argentine pontiff set the tone for his first-ever visit to the U.S. at the start of his first full day. "As a son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families," he said at the start of brief remarks during an elaborate White House welcoming ceremony.
The comments came as immigration is under fierce debate in the 2016 presidential race and as efforts to pass an overhaul of the system have stalled in Congress due to party divisions.
"Our mission as bishops is first and foremost to solidify unity," he said. "This service to unity is particularly important for this nation, whose vast . . . resources impose significant moral responsibilities" for world "peace, prosperity and integration."
Later, in a speech to bishops, Pope Francis again touched on the issue of immigration, calling for special attention to the influx of Latin-American immigrants in the Catholic Church -- a group that is the main driver of growth of the faith in the U.S. He told the bishops that they may be challenged by such diversity but that these immigrants have resources that should be shared.
The pope largely avoided the scandal that has seriously undermined the U.S. church -- sexual abuse of minors by priests. He made only a brief reference to the problem in remarks to the bishops, thanking U.S. church leaders for working to ensure that such crimes won't be repeated while making no mention of punishing abusive priests or church leaders who covered up incidents. The pope is expected to meet victims of sex abuse during his visit.
The pontiff, through his policy pronouncements, presented himself as a unifying figure in a deeply divided country.
Democrats and Republicans, who are at odds in current policy debates, agree on their admiration of Pope Francis. The pope's White House arrival ceremony drew Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike, and GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush attended Mass with the pontiff.
Both parties sought to highlight areas where the pope bolstered their views while playing down areas where he didn't.
Mr. Obama thanked Pope Francis for his key role in supporting his effort to restore U.S. diplomatic relations with Cuba and highlighted the pontiff's endorsement of his climate-change initiatives.
"Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet -- God's magnificent gift to us," Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Obama's aides hope the pope's support of initiatives to combat climate change will boost the chances of a broad agreement at an international meeting on the problem this December in Paris.
The pope, who in a major encyclical published last May threw his support behind those arguing that human activity is contributing to climate change, has been unusually forthright in saying he hopes the Paris meeting will produce new solutions.
Republicans, by contrast, seized on the pope's comments on religious freedom and gay marriage.
"I was encouraged that Pope Francis began his first speech in the U.S. by expressing appreciation for America's founding principles, especially religious liberty, and the importance of traditional marriage, family and the sanctity of life to our culture," said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R., Kan.). Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.) said he was "grateful to hear Pope Francis bring up the importance of religious liberty."
Yet it is unclear the pope's message will change the tone of policy debates in Washington.
"Everybody wants a clean planet, everybody wants to take care of those who are less fortunate," said Rep. Tom Rooney (R., Fla.). "I believe this pope is saying the right things about how I should live my life as an individual and how I should raise my children. How that translates into public policy, I just think is very different."
Thousands of people turned out for the pope on Wednesday. The day began with Mr. Obama welcoming the pope at the White House, where more than 11,000 were gathered on the South Lawn.
After the public event, Mr. Obama gave Pope Francis a tour of the White House and the two met privately for 40 minutes, without aides, in the Oval Office.
They discussed a range of issues, according to the White House, including the moral responsibility to offer refuge to people who are forced to flee their homelands and the right of all people to practice their faith.
The pope ended his day by celebrating an outdoor Mass where he proclaimed Father Junipero Serra, the friar considered the father of California's missions, a saint.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- When Pope Francis becomes the third pontiff to visit the White House, President Barack Obama plans to use the moment to advance core components of his policy agenda.
He'll have to tread carefully, however, as the effort to capitalize on the high-profile meeting is diplomatically sensitive.
Unlike in meetings with other foreign leaders, Mr. Obama won't be trying to shape the pontiff's views before or during his Wednesday appearance at the White House. Instead, White House officials are looking at ways to tweak the president's message to more closely align with the pope's pronouncements on issues where they already overlap, including two central to the president's second-term agenda: combating climate change and renewing U.S. relations with Cuba.
Mr. Obama's push on both issues has drawn criticism from Republicans. But Pope Francis has advocated for similar actions on climate change and played a key role in facilitating the historic thaw between Washington and Havana.
The White House also announced, in advance of the pope's arrival, a more robust response to the refugee crisis that has mostly stemmed from the civil war in Syria, including a decision to accept 10,000 additional Syrian refugees during the next year, an increase of 30,000 in the U.S. intake of refugees overall and additional humanitarian aid.
Pope Francis has called on Europe's Catholics to accept refugees and met with one family at the Vatican before flying to Havana last weekend.
The challenge for Mr. Obama, though, is to seize on those overlapping views without appearing to be overly political in doing so.
"Anybody who tries to use Pope Francis is going to be disappointed, and that goes for the right and the left, in the church and outside the church, because while he is consistent in his defense of human life and human dignity, we are not," said John Carr, director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought & Public Life at Georgetown University.
The pope looks askance at political gamesmanship, which means the administration will be moving cautiously.
"This is a huge moment," said Christopher Hale, executive director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good. "Pope Francis and the president share many values." Yet Mr. Hale, who helped the Obama campaign with Catholic outreach, warned that the pontiff "has a profound aversion to being used as a political football to push people's agendas."
That, in part, is why much of the White House's public campaign to use the papal visit to promote Mr. Obama's policies actually is set to unfold in the days after the meeting.
"We are very sensitive that what makes [the pope's] statements powerful is that they come from him. They don't come from our requests," said Ben Rhodes, one of Mr. Obama's closest foreign-policy advisers.
Mr. Obama and the pope also differ on issues such as abortion and gay rights, and the White House hopes to play down those differences. The pope also has been a critic of U.S. consumerism and capitalism.
Mr. Obama will be one of just three presidents to host a pope at the White House. President Jimmy Carter received Pope John Paul II in 1979, and President George W. Bush welcomed Pope Benedict XVI in 2008.

Full text:   Next week, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping will add to earlier pledges to cut greenhouse-gas emissions with specific guidance on what the two countries will do at home to keep climate change at bay, officials said.
The United States and China announced Tuesday that cities, states and provinces in both countries would commit to taking parallel steps to address climate change.
The participating Chinese cities and provinces, which represent about 25% of total urban emissions in that country, will offer plans to have their emissions peak sooner than the national target of 2030.
Beijing and Guangzhou, two of China's largest cities, will aim for their peak emissions to come as early as 2020.
Climate officials and leaders from both countries are meeting in Los Angeles this week to lay out the steps the regions will take and to set the groundwork for next week's summit between the two presidents.
U.S. officials said the Obama-Xi summit is part of an effort by the two biggest polluters -- which account for more than a third of global greenhouse-gas emissions -- to demonstrate progress on meeting the terms of a bilateral accord reached in November.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that Mr. Obama would use next week's meeting to discuss additional opportunities for U.S.-China cooperation on cutting carbon pollution.
The U.S. commitments are coming from states such as California and Connecticut and an array of cities including Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, Washington, Seattle, and Houston.
The U.S. pledged last year to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2025, compared with 2005 levels, while China said it would make sure its emissions peak by 2030 or earlier.
To achieve its goal, the Obama administration this summer finalized new rules for coal power plants.
Some prominent Republicans in Congress say the moves will damage the U.S. economy and are moving to block the rules in court; they are seeking to undermine Mr. Obama's authority to conclude a binding agreement among nearly 200 nations, which is meant to come to a head in Paris later this year.
"Last year was a year for setting goals and targets," said Brian Deese, a senior White House adviser who specializes in climate issues. "This year needs to be a year of implementation."
The Chinese cities' commitment to early peaking highlights the country's efforts to achieve its national target as early as possible, Mr. Deese said, and the joint U.S.-China actions show the seriousness of the effort to meet the terms of the countries' agreement.
The cities, states and provinces that sign the declaration and pledge to address climate change also will track and report their emissions on a regular basis. Such commitments create a measure of accountability, Mr. Deese said.
For the world's highly developed economies, a top goal of the agreement expected in Paris in December is signing up fast-growing emerging markets, which have avoided the burden of reducing emissions in previous agreements organized by the United Nations.
The U.S.-China climate discussions will spill into a range of wider discussions among countries gathering later this month at the U.N.
China's move last year reassured environmentalists about Beijing's commitment, but India and other emerging markets haven't submitted their own proposals for cutting emissions through the Paris accord.
Republicans in Congress say China got off easy by agreeing to start reducing emissions only in 2030. A slowing Chinese economy and rebalancing away from heavy manufacturing could allow China to achieve the goal much earlier without significant costs, according to some climate experts.
A survey this summer by the China Carbon Forum, an independent organization that promotes efforts to curb climate change in China, found that 82% of industry experts say China will reach its emissions peak before 2030, with 39% saying before 2025 and 16% before 2020.
Mr. Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the pledges announced Tuesday signaled that China's emissions could peak before 2030.
Environmentalists have cheered China's commitment to boosting green energy, a shared goal U.S. officials say will likely come up during Mr. Xi's visit.
The two leaders may also tackle some of the thorny unresolved issues of the international climate talks, including poorer countries' insistence that developed economies help finance their transitions at a cost of around $100 billion a year for all countries combined.
"Anything that signaled a preparedness to find some common ground on the outstanding issues would be welcomed," said Jo Tyndall, New Zealand's climate-change ambassador, in Washington last week.

Full text:   I'm amazed at Sen. John McCain's inability to understand that the real dangers facing the U.S. are the forces causing the melting of Arctic ice, which are far more threatening than Vladimir Putin's theatrical posturing ("The Real Arctic Threat," op-ed, Sept. 2).
Sen. McCain's failure to extrapolate from the current melting to the dangers of extreme climate change, for which no other threat compares, underscores that he is utterly unprepared for the new world we are in. Climate change is the result of past accumulations and increasing CO2 emissions. Therefore, reducing those emissions is the principal security effort he should be engaged in, starting with getting the U.S. to enact a carbon fee and dividend program. A tax on carbon emissions buttressed by a tariff on imports from countries without a comparable program would result in the rest of the world quickly following suit and ending Mr. Putin's imperialistic ambitions.

Full text:   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Democrats in California, which already has the toughest climate-change rules in the U.S., are pushing to strengthen them drastically, an effort that has spurred business groups to mount an intense opposition campaign.
A proposed state law would cut petroleum-fuel use by 50%, require utilities to get half their power from renewable sources, and increase energy efficiency in buildings by 50% -- all by 2030, using 2016 levels as the starting point. A second measure would mandate an 80% reduction in state greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050, from 1990 levels.
The bills are backed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who say that California must begin taking serious steps to curb its use of fossil fuels.
Business organizations and the energy industry say the effort would hurt the state economy and hit residents' wallets.
Both measures have passed the California Senate, though none of the 14 Republicans in the 40-member body voted for them. Bob Huff, the former state Senate minority leader, called reducing greenhouse gases a "noble" goal, but said "those gases don't end at California's border."
The legislation would have to be approved by the California Assembly, where Democrats also dominate -- though some have withheld support over concerns about their economic impact, making the bills' fate too close to call, observers say.
While the energy sector doesn't have a specific projection for how much the proposed policies would cost the state economy, a June study commissioned by the petroleum industry estimates 184,100 Californians received a total of $23.3 billion in pay and benefits from the oil and gas industry in 2013.
Both sides of the issue are stepping up their game.
An opposition campaign from the oil industry is warning state residents in television, radio and mail advertisements that the mandates would result in fuel rationing and driving restrictions.
"If you can afford a Tesla [electric car], then this message won't really matter to you," a woman says in one of the television ads for the group California Drivers Alliance, which is backed by the Western States Petroleum Association.
Mr. Brown has raised his rhetoric in response, saying on the shores of Lake Tahoe in August that "the oil industry is in deep trouble" because it sells a "product that is highly destructive." At another event in Oakland last month, the governor said climate change has exacerbated the state's wildfires and refuted the oil industry's argument, saying: "This is not about rationing. As a matter of fact, if you're in the business of selling a product that the state says we want you to sell half as much, obviously they're going to do everything they can to prevent that."
The governor said he is working with the bills' critics, which include the California Chamber of Commerce, but said he has "no intention of backing down."
The measures don't lay out specific ways to reach the targets; the details would be left to California's Air Resources Board. The hope is that setting the goals would spur industry innovations, including in zero-emissions vehicles and biofuels.
The Western States Petroleum Association spent $2.5 million lobbying California lawmakers through the first half of the year on a host of legislation, including the two climate-change bills, lobbying reports show. Tupper Hull, a spokesman for the group, said the petroleum-reduction mandate was "a very poorly conceived and reckless attempt to slash how much fuel is available for Californians to use."
The new legislation would add to California's efforts to fight climate change, which include populating the state's freeways with electric cars and other low-emission vehicles, increasing biofuels in gasoline and building a high-speed train line.
California produces about 1.5% of the world's greenhouse-gas emissions. But the state has long been a bellwether on environmental regulations, passing laws that are copied by other states and become templates for federal environmental rules.
President Barack Obama recently cited the state's proposed 50% curb on petroleum use by motor vehicles as an example of how states could act to combat climate change. Among the proposals' biggest backers is Mr. Steyer, a former hedge-fund manager who has become one of the Democrats' most generous donors nationally and has begun using his fortune to shape environmental policy in California.
Mr. Steyer spent $29.6 million to bankroll an initiative in 2012 that uses corporate taxes to fund energy upgrades at schools and other buildings. His NextGen Climate organization has spent close to $730,000 lobbying California lawmakers on legislation including the two climate-change bills, lobbying records show.
"If we can afford to get our message out, our message wins," said Mr. Steyer.
Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, said he sees reducing petroleum fuel use by 50% in the state as a "long-shot," requiring major advances in biofuels, or a rapid expansion of low-emission vehicles. Other experts say the goals are achievable.
"This focus on California reducing our own greenhouse gases, without really thinking hard about how the rest of the world is reducing greenhouse gases, is misguided," Dr. Borenstein said. "I think what we should refocus on is this: helping develop the technologies that China and India, and the rest of the developing world, would actually adopt."

Full text:   The correct headline for the Aug. 29 letters responding to Daniel Yergin's "Power Up" essay isn't "Green, 'Alternative' Energy Is Moving to the Big Time" but "Green Part-Time Energy." Utility-scale green electricity exists as adjunct energy only because it is on a grid with full-time electricity producers. As the green movement kills full-time electricity producers, starting with coal, substituting so-called solar and wind "alternatives" will kill civilization as we know it. Think of reading essays at night by the light of candles.
Storage of green energy can work for homes and other small nonutility applications, as Richard Factor writes about Arizona. In sunny Arizona, a reasonable-size battery can bridge the electricity gap from sunsets to sunrises. In New England, where five or more days can pass without a visible sunrise, battery sizes must grow by a factor of five or more. Universal utility-scale storage has yet to be invented.

Paul Bledsoe's letter demonstrates his skills as political propagandist and environmental activist. Devoid of a single credible reference, his letter purports to solve the fact of eternal climate change. His letter speaks of authoritative dogma, not scientific argument.
"Capturing carbon dioxide" isn't the answer. The Energy Department pulled support in February for FutureGen Industrial Alliance Inc., a public-private partnership to build a coal plant that would store its CO2 emissions. A similar project in Kemper County, Miss., is now projected to cost almost $5.6 billion, not the estimated $2.4 billion. Such plants require a secondary power-generation source to supply the approximate 40% additional energy to drive the CO2 compression and burial scheme.
The false threat of climate change caused by the use of fossil-fueled power plants and CO2 release is documented by the current 18-plus-year lack of change in the global temperature record as provided by NASA satellites, even as atmospheric CO2 has increased over 10%. It is now over 10 years since a Category 3 or higher hurricane has hit the U.S. mainland. Two cycles of declining sunspot activity suggest a cooling trend. The droughts in the West are well-known to be cyclical.
The true disaster for the Paris climate meeting is the lack of credible evidence for supporting the climate scare story.

World News: Catholics in U.S. Split on Families

Full text:   Roman Catholics in America overwhelmingly believe it is best to raise children in a household with a married mother and father, but most also consider families composed of unmarried or same-sex couples acceptable, according to a survey released Wednesday.
The survey by the Pew Research Center sought to capture how practicing and nonpracticing U.S. Catholics viewed family issues in advance of Pope Francis' visit this month. He is set to address Congress and the United Nations and spend a weekend in Philadelphia.
Pope Francis has emphasized themes of inclusion, alleviating poverty and protecting the environment, and is seen as attempting to steer the church away from clashes over divisive social issues. Some Catholic leaders in the U.S., especially those appointed by earlier popes, remain outspoken against same-sex marriage, artificial contraception and abortion.
The findings show Catholic views roughly mirror the sentiments of other Americans on divorce and homosexuality, though Catholics as a whole tend to be more disapproving.
About 84% of Catholics say it is acceptable for children to be raised by unmarried parents, according to the study of more than 5,000 adults surveyed in May and June. Almost half -- 48% -- say that situation is as good as any other, while 35% say it is acceptable but not ideal.
Of those who attend Mass weekly, 36% say it is unacceptable for a same-sex couple to raise children, while 25% say it is acceptable but not as good as other family situations. In contrast, almost half of Catholics who attend Mass less than once a week say a same-sex couple raising children is not only acceptable, but just as good as any other family arrangement, the survey found.
A Knights of Columbus-Marist poll released last week found that 43% of Catholics say same-sex marriage is wrong. Among Catholics who attend church weekly, the number rises to 59%.
In the Pew poll, 83% of Catholics say it is acceptable for children to be raised by divorced parents, though 52% say that situation isn't as good as others.
The poll also found 57% of Catholics -- and 73% who attend Mass weekly -- believe it is sinful to have an abortion, compared with 48% of the general public.
Separately, Pew researchers said the survey "suggests that Pope Francis may have a difficult time persuading Catholics in the U.S. to adopt his philosophy about excess and his focus on the environment."
The poll found nearly 60% say working to help the poor is "essential" to Catholic identity, while only 29% say working to address climate change is an essential part of their Catholic identity.

Full text:   KENAI FJORDS NATIONAL PARK, Alaska -- President Barack Obama hiked to a shrinking glacier Tuesday, traveling to this icy expanse to deliver a visual message to the country: This is what climate change looks like.
Mr. Obama spent the day in the Kenai Mountains, exploring Exit Glacier, which has receded as the planet has warmed, touring the area by boat and even taping a segment for an outdoor adventure show.
The president's arguments were familiar, but the White House is hoping that a change in scenery will help galvanize support for combating global warming. His visit comes as public consensus in the U.S. is growing that the earth is heating up and that people are responsible.
"This is as good of a signpost of what we're dealing with when it comes to climate change as just about anything," Mr. Obama said as he stood about a quarter-mile from the glacier, which he called spectacular. "It sends a message about the urgency we're going to need to have when it comes to dealing with this."
In a Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll conducted earlier this year, 34% of respondents said addressing the issue of climate change should be an absolute priority this year. More people -- some 37% -- said the issue could be delayed until next year, and 27% said addressing climate change shouldn't be pursued.
During his hike, the president marveled at both the natural beauty of the state and the threat to this glacier, which is 10% smaller than it was in 1950.
Still, as the president tours the nation's largest state by area through Wednesday, his message to Alaskans is more nuanced than the one-note narrative aimed at the American public.
Climate change has to be addressed, Alaska's leaders have told Mr. Obama, but so, too, does the state's $3.5 billion deficit and its sagging oil revenues.
In this state, where oil is central to the economy and sea levels are rising, permafrost is melting, and wildfires are multiplying, the complexities of the president's climate and energy policies are on stark display. Mr. Obama is calling for aggressive action to combat climate change even as he acknowledges that the U.S. economy must rely on oil and gas for now.
Many Alaskans have urged Mr. Obama to clear the way for more energy development. The administration recently approved a permit allowing Royal Dutch Shell to drill in the Arctic Ocean.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) has excoriated the administration's efforts to set aside as wilderness more than 12 million acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where petroleum reserves are plentiful. She argued earlier this year that the administration has delivered a kick to the gut of the state's economy by treating Alaska like a "nice little snow globe."
White House officials said they spoke with stakeholders and communities before the president's visit to ensure that the administration understood the challenges facing Alaska.
David Biette, director of the Polar Initiative at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said climate change is an important issue, but he cautioned against using Alaska as little more than a stage set to make a visually compelling argument.
"I don't think we treat Alaska as a serious state," Mr. Biette said. The president "shouldn't use Alaska as a backdrop for climate change. What's in it for Alaskans?"
The president's historic visit -- Mr. Obama will be the first sitting president to travel north of the Arctic Circle -- has been celebrated by many in Alaska. Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said it was exciting to see a president make his state a destination and "not just a low-on-fuel stop."
He added, though, that the state faces serious issues beyond climate change. "We're about 90% tied to the price of oil," he said, noting that plummeting revenues have led to cuts in services.
While climate change has gotten top billing this week, the White House has rolled out other policy announcements, including the decision to rename North America's tallest mountain, returning Mount McKinley to its traditional Alaska Native moniker, Denali.
The White House also said it would accelerate the acquisition of a replacement icebreaker, which the Coast Guard uses to support Arctic scientific research and other work.
"We want to make sure our grandkids can see this," Mr. Obama said of Exit Glacier.

Full text:   President Barack Obama's trip to Alaska's Arctic on Monday likely will reverberate much farther south, on the 2016 presidential campaign trail, where global warming is expected to emerge as a key issue.
His visit to the region, the first ever for a sitting president, coincides with a growing public consensus that the earth is heating up and that humans have something to do with it.
A July report from the Pew Research Center found that 72% of American adults say there is "solid evidence" of global warming. Of those respondents, 46% said the warming trend is "mostly due to human activity," compared with 22% who blamed it mostly on "natural patterns."
Democrats are particularly convinced human behavior is driving climate change, emboldening Hillary Clinton and her primary rivals to prescribe more aggressive solutions than those pushed by Mr. Obama.
The crowded Republican field remains divided on the issue, although public opinion is prompting some candidates to address it in more substantive ways.
In past presidential elections, climate change was a second-tier topic. Mr. Obama has made clear that he views this issue as central to his legacy and his actions are serving as a benchmark for the candidates.
In early August, the Environmental Protection Agency issued the first-ever federal regulations to cut carbon emissions from power plants. It also is regulating carbon emissions from cars and trucks and is working on rules cutting emissions of methane from oil and gas drilling.
Mr. Obama's Arctic visit will be the latest in a series of trips and speeches the president has been making to build momentum toward a United Nations conference this year where world leaders will decide whether to agree to cut global carbon emissions. While in the region Monday through Wednesday, Mr. Obama plans to visit villages in Alaska that the White House says are threatened by climate change.
Mrs. Clinton has described Mr. Obama's rules for power plants as "the floor, not the ceiling" in addressing climate change. She also opposed the Obama administration's recent approval of a permit for Royal Dutch Shell to drill in the Arctic Ocean, a decision environmentalists have criticized.
"I think Secretary Clinton has made a decision to prioritize climate change in her campaign," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. "You have polling consistently showing Americans want more action on climate change."
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton's rivals in the Democratic primary, oppose the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which is awaiting a decision from Mr. Obama's administration.
Mrs. Clinton, who as secretary of state oversaw the earlier stages of the review, has declined to take a position on the pipeline, although she recently expressed frustration about how long -- nearly seven years -- it has taken to review the project.
Donald Trump, who is leading the GOP presidential field, tweeted this month that if elected, he would approve Keystone immediately because it would have "no impact" on the environment. All the other GOP candidates support it, too.
"The environment is an important issue," said John Feehery, president of Quinn Gillespie Communications and a former House GOP adviser. "It's something that Republicans have to improve their messaging on, especially when you're talking about younger voters."
Most of the Republican candidates have shied away from speaking on the issue, as deep divisions remain within the party about the science behind climate change and, if they agree it's occurring, its causes.
Mr. Trump has said he doesn't think climate change caused by human activity is real, though he hasn't spoken publicly on the matter recently.
"This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING b------- has got to stop," Mr. Trump tweeted on Jan. 1, 2014, one of his more recent posts on the subject. "Our planet is freezing, record low temps, and our GW scientists are stuck in ice."
A spokeswoman for his campaign declined to comment last week on his position, saying Mr. Trump "will address these issues over the next several weeks."
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has equivocated on climate change in the past, said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal last week that human activity has contributed to climate change and he would address it as president.
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is the only GOP candidate who actively has talked about the need to address climate change.
"Here's a question you need to ask everybody running as a Republican: What is the environmental policy of the Republican Party?" Mr. Graham said on CNN in June. "When I ask that question, I get a blank stare."

Full text:   Daniel Yergin ("Power Up," Review, Aug. 22) is precisely right that new energy technologies have historically taken many decades to become price competitive and widely deployed. But climate change is a far more profound threat than any previous energy challenge. Climate change requires more profound and urgent policy responses than past transitions. We know how to cut emissions. Some combination of pricing carbon, regulation of emissions and efficiency, incentivizing alternatives and capturing carbon dioxide is needed. To be most effective, these policies must be adopted by all major emitting nations, which is why gaining an agreement at the climate negotiations in Paris this December is essential. Yes, oil, natural gas and coal will continue to have a role, if reduced, in our economies. But alternatives must be deployed, and quickly, because complacency in the face of climate disaster isn't economically or morally acceptable.

Dr. Yergin's prediction of slow and steady growth in solar from about 1% this year up to 4% to 9% of total global electricity by 2040 seems far short of the mark. As is already happening here in Arizona, and no doubt in other sunny states, the utilities are seeing their income from customers with rooftop solar greatly diminish. They understandably are fighting back by charging not just for electricity, but separately for connection to the grid. Maintaining the grid infrastructure is an enormous expense to utilities, and must be recovered from rate payers. Rooftop solar power can be infrastructure-free, just as many homeowners have their own wells and septic systems. As the utilities necessarily increase their connection charges to compensate for the newly disconnected, ever more people will think that utility power is a bad deal and also disconnect. This will ultimately result in electric utilities holding sway only in urban or perpetually cloudy areas. Unlike large generation plants, enormous wind turbines and especially nuclear reactors, all of which require years of planning, personal and small industrial solar installations can be planned and installed in a month or so, and the rate of these installations is likely to accelerate rapidly.

I feel current "sustainability" ideas are on the wrong track. I don't think solar energy is sustainable because it takes too much energy to manufacture the panels and auxiliary equipment needed. Nuclear-power plants operate 24/7 and are, cradle to grave, the lowest CO2 energy sources. Their 100% duty cycle, compared with about 20% for solar, means less capital investment and less grid-management capital infrastructure. Solar and wind have about 30-year life expectancies compared with 60 to 120 years for new nuclear installations, again, reducing capital costs in both energy units and dollars.

Full text:   In your Aug. 19 editorial "Tom Steyer's Stimulus" you mischaracterize the success of Proposition 39, the California ballot measure I co-chaired with George Shultz and Kevin de Leon in 2012. In truth, hundreds of millions of dollars in extra funds are now flowing to California schools because of this law.
Prop. 39 closed a corporate tax loophole for companies that ship local jobs to other states. Schools are using the money for much needed upgrades to their energy systems. In the first 16 months of the program, our schools saved $25 million in annual energy costs, leaving more money for books, teachers and playgrounds. Despite the misleading math in the initial reporting, we've also created thousands of jobs -- and this is just the beginning. Many schools are in the planning stages of much bigger construction projects, which will mean more jobs and more savings.
Just as important, this transition to clean energy will help protect our air, water and the health of our children by cutting pollution. Energy savings through efficiency, along with clean technologies like solar and wind, are also critical ways to address the moral challenge of our time -- climate change.
Critics complain that Prop. 39 was supposed to generate even more money and jobs by now, but let's count up the figures after the work is done. For decades, Big Oil has denied basic science in their fight against policies that combat climate change. But now it seems they've moved on to simply denying basic math.
The record is clear: By embracing policies like Prop. 39 that grow our economy and cut carbon pollution, California is building on the more than 430,000 advanced energy jobs that already exist in the state -- and leading the world in the fight against climate change.

Intelligence Worker
Charged With Treason
German prosecutors charged an intelligence agency worker with treason for allegedly passing documents to U.S. and Russian spies, in a politically explosive case that prompted Berlin to expel the top U.S. spy official from Germany more than a year ago.
In an indictment that was filed last week at Munich's higher regional court and made public Thursday, the Federal Prosecutor's office charged a 32-year-old man identified as Markus R. on two counts of treason, breach of official secrecy and bribery.
According to the charges, the alleged informant for the Central Intelligence Agency came into contact with U.S. spies in 2008 and, in exchange for payment of at least 95,000 euros ($106,000), passed official documents and information about Germany's intelligence activities to the CIA until his arrest in July 2014.
Prosecutors said Markus R. also approached the Russian secret service in mid-2014 and passed three documents to Russia's general consulate in Munich.
The CIA, the Russian Foreign Ministry, and the Russian Federal Security Service didn't respond to requests for comment.
Markus R. had worked for Germany's foreign intelligence service, known as the BND, since 2007, according to the indictment. Beginning in 2008, he oversaw mail distribution and filed classified documents for a BND department that coordinates relations with foreign intelligence agencies.

EUROPEAN UNION
Top Official Says
Climate Deal in Danger
A planned global deal to keep average temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius to contain climate change is under threat unless more countries submit emission-reduction targets, the European Union's energy and climate commissioner said.
"The window of opportunity . . . is closing fast," Miguel Arias Canete said on Thursday.
With just over three months to go until the Paris Climate Conference, which is meant to come up with a follow-up agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, 56 out of more than 190 countries, representing 61% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, have submitted targets for reducing these emissions, Mr. Canete said.
While that is up from the 35 nations that submitted targets under the Kyoto deal, targets are still missing from some big economies, including Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
The EU last fall agreed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions 40% by 2030 from 1990 levels. The U.S., which never ratified the Kyoto Protocol, has submitted a plan to cut emissions between 26% and 28% from 2005 levels over the next 10 years.
In 2010, about 200 governments agreed to reduce emissions to ensure that global temperatures didn't rise by more than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.

RUSSIA
Putin Ally Departs
As Head of Railway
Russia replaced the head of state-owned Russian RailwaysVladimir Yakunin on Thursday, the first major shake-up in the country's upper echelons of power since the country fell into recession this year.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said he had accepted the resignation of 67-year-old Mr. Yakunin, a longtime friend of President Vladimir Putin, and appointed a relatively unknown deputy transport minister in his place.
Mr. Yakunin had run Russian Railways, the country's largest commercial employer with around one million people, for more than a decade. He has been nominated for a seat in Russia's upper house of parliament, a largely ceremonial post.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday will propose the first-ever federal regulations to cut methane emissions from the nation's oil and natural-gas industry, according to people familiar with the move, which is part of President Barack Obama's climate agenda.
The EPA is expected to propose regulations aimed at cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40% to 45% over the next decade from 2012 levels, said a person familiar with the plan. That was the goal the agency said earlier this year it would pursue when it first unveiled its plans.
The move is part of a broader regulatory agenda Mr. Obama is pursuing as he seeks to make addressing climate change a legacy of his time in the White House. Earlier this month, the EPA issued final rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants 32% by 2030 based on emissions levels from 2005.
Tuesday's announcement reflects the Obama administration's middle-ground approach toward the oil and gas industry. The Interior Department said Monday it has issued a permit to Royal Dutch Shell PLC to drill for oil and natural gas in the Arctic Ocean, providing the company a long-sought victory and angering environmentalists.
Meanwhile, with the onset of the fracking boom, concerns over methane, a potent greenhouse gas, have grown within the administration. Methane has a warming effect on the planet more than 20 times greater than carbon dioxide, according to the EPA.
Mr. Obama directed his administration to address methane emissions as part of the climate plan he announced in June 2013.
Oil and gas companies sometimes inadvertently emit methane during different parts of the production and transmission process.
By capturing the methane, companies both cut down on the emissions and are able to capitalize on additional product, since methane is the primary component of natural gas.
The plan is sure to draw fire from some energy companies who argue that new regulations will require the installation of costly mitigation systems, as low oil prices pinch profits across the industry.
Companies will be required to install technology that prevents methane from being inadvertently leaked and to monitor their operations for possible leaks. Many companies are already using this kind of equipment, according to industry executives and the EPA.
Thanks largely to hydraulic fracturing, since 2005, domestic oil production has nearly doubled and natural-gas production has risen by about 50%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Methane emissions from the sector have dropped roughly 15% over that period through 2012, according to EPA data, but the agency estimates that these emissions will rise 25% over the next decade if steps aren't taken to cut them.
The agency is expected to complete the rules in 2016, after a public comment period.
In announcing its intent to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas industry earlier this year, EPA said it would propose rules on new oil and gas wells only, a move that environmentalists say falls short of what is needed to address climate change.
"It's very clear we are going to need regulation for existing sources in order to achieve the 40% to 45% reduction," said Mark Brownstein, vice president of the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund, on a call with other environmental groups Monday previewing the rule. "The question will then be, how far down the road does this particular regulation take us to address existing sources?"
Many executives in the oil and gas industry say any regulation is unnecessary because they are reducing methane emissions already, though some company officials have said cutting such emissions could help them save money and wouldn't impose a prohibitive cost.
The American Petroleum Institute, the nation's largest trade group representing all parts of the oil and gas industry, has said it could support further regulation of new drilling wells for volatile organic compounds, smog-forming pollutants, a regulatory step that would indirectly cut methane emissions.
The EPA in 2012 issued a regulation requiring such cuts from natural-gas wells that have been hydraulic fractured, an extraction technique where large amounts of water and sand, and small amounts of chemicals, are injected deep underground to unlock oil and natural gas trapped in shale rock formations.
API opposes the EPA's move to directly regulate methane emissions from new sources, because that could lead to a requirement to regulate the emissions from existing sources, which would affect hundreds of thousands of wells, according to Howard Feldman, director of regulatory and scientific affairs at API.

Full text:   Corrections & Amplifications
The name of the Association of State Floodplain Managers was incorrectly given as the Association of Floodplain Managers in an article on Monday about a new flood map for the New York City region.
(WSJ August 19, 2015)
Two years ago, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a new flood map for the New York City region, one that substantially expanded what's known as the "100-year floodplain" -- areas where there is at least a 1% chance of flooding in any given year.
FEMA's map, a preliminary document still subject to final approval and its first significant update since 1983, would expand the number of city residents in the 100-year floodplain by 83% to 400,000. It nearly doubles the number of structures in the zone to 71,500.
Now, the city is challenging FEMA's map, saying it overstates the risk of flooding in much of the expanded flood zone, unnecessarily imposing insurance and other costs on homeowners. In late June, the city released the results of its own analysis, conducted by consulting firm Arcadis, which produced a smaller flood zone, one the city says is more reasonable than FEMA's.
Whichever interpretation prevails, the city's appeal has sparked a debate about balancing home affordability against flood risk, and the outcome has potentially huge economic stakes for homeowners, businesses and neighborhoods near the water's edge.
"It's critically important to get these as accurate as possible," said Daniel Zarrilli, director of the Mayor's Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which appealed the FEMA map. "A lot of other issues of policy come from what is on these maps."
The city's map would remove about 26,000 structures and 170,000 people from FEMA's floodplain, potentially sparing them a steep increase in insurance costs. Homeowners in a 100-year zone are effectively required to buy flood insurance -- especially if they have a federally backed mortgage -- and the premiums can cost $5,000 to $10,000 a year, Mr. Zarrilli said. Inclusion in a flood zone "can have a devastating impact on neighborhoods," he said.
It also likely lowers a home's value and raises the income required to qualify for a federally backed mortgage. In addition, flood maps determine building codes, which influence the cost and structural requirements for new construction or renovations on waterfront land.
FEMA expects to begin talks with the city in coming weeks, said Andrew Martin, the agency's regional representative. If the city and FEMA can't agree, the city or FEMA can request a review by the Scientific Resolution Panel, an independent body based in Washington, D.C., or the dispute could end up in federal court.
New York City isn't the only jurisdiction appealing FEMA's map. Mr. Martin said the agency has received 190 comments and appeals from communities across New York and New Jersey, 60% of them backed by scientific or engineering data, he said.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, for example, is challenging the extent of FEMA's floodplain at Newark International Airport, authority officials said.
Jersey City will submit a letter of support for New York's appeal, said its mayor, Steven Fulop. "Our own review shows that as many as 28,000 Jersey City residents have inaccurately been placed in the 100-year flood zone and might unnecessarily face vastly increased flood insurance," he said in a statement.
Some elected officials and neighborhood advocates support New York City's appeal, albeit with reservations.
"It was necessary for the city to do it, to try to keep that affordability for homeowners," said Donovan Richards, a City Council member who represents parts of Queens. "But we also have to be cautious, and not shrink the map to the extent that if another storm comes, these homeowners would not have been in the flood zone."
Others question whether city officials, eager to maintain affordable housing for their constituents, underestimate the risk of natural disaster.
"There is a lot of talking in the formal appeal about how aggressive New York City is being in terms of climate change," said Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of Floodplain Managers, a professional association. "Yet they are almost regressing to old data and old methods, and not wanting to look at sea-level rise and climate change."
In New York City's appeal letter, Mr. Zarrilli said the city takes climate change seriously and is adapting buildings, telecommunications, transportation and other infrastructure to withstand severe weather events.
While it is important for flood maps to reflect the best science, the city's appeal creates uncertainty, notes Caroline Nagy, policy manager at the Center for NYC Neighborhoods, which advocates for affordable Homeownership.
"It puts us in a hard place," she said, "because it's hard to help people get prepared because you don't know what the map will be like or when it will be implemented."
Affected homeowners are well-acquainted with the anxiety that comes with living in flood-prone areas.
High insurance bills could "wipe out the middle class in the beach communities," said Larry Scheiber, a salesman who lives in Belle Harbor, Queens. "Speaking with my friends and neighbors, people are aware of [the appeal], but looking at the bills that come in, you're looking at what's right in front of you."
In the Brooklyn neighborhood of Red Hook this month, residents Andrea and Stephen Kondaks showed off new flood vents in their 1860s house. They hope the vents will lower their flood-insurance premium.
"There is a lot of anxiety in terms of flood-insurance increases," Ms. Kondaks said. "We're all sitting here saying, 'What is it, what are you threatening us with? Is it $7,000, is it $5,000? What's the number?' "

Full text:   Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp's "A Clean-Energy Breakthrough" op-ed, Aug. 4) is utter nonsense, starting with the inarticulate term "carbon pollution" (soot?) that ultimately morphs into "climate pollution" (whatever that is). If one means carbon dioxide, then say it and be clear about it.
The Clean Air Act is a health-focused law, not a climate-focused law. Carbon dioxide at 400 or 500 parts per million isn't going to kill me, my children or my grandchildren, let alone have any adverse health effects. Only if and when we come to understand the relative importance to climate change of natural variability and human-influenced effects, then perhaps we can consider legislation. We aren't even close to that understanding, and as time moves forward the "settled science" is becoming more unsettled.
The EPA's endangerment finding is on increasingly shaky ground (especially if we could actually see the science behind it). There has been no warming over the last 18 years despite one-fifth of all human CO2 emissions in history going into the atmosphere. The climate models are increasingly diverging from the observed temperature record; they fail the engineering test of usability through a lack of validation and verification. We are wrenching the energy economy around on such a basis?
What about the "competitively priced clean energy" that is supposed to becoming commonplace? That seems to be uncommon here in California where we enjoy well above average electricity rates for our renewable portfolio standard. Did I mention the carbon tax on transportation fuels?
Expect more nonsense from the green full-court press ahead of the Paris climate talks in December. Every ill on the news will be linked to climate change between now and then.

Mr. Krupp makes clear that the government should be run by a few bureaucrats and not Congress and the people. The only accurate statement he makes about the EPA's Clean Power Plan is that "the countries that move the fastest toward clean energy . . . will have the healthiest air." The reason isn't what he thinks, though. It will be because the cost of manufacturing will be so expensive due to high energy costs that the remaining U.S. manufacturing companies will continue to move to countries that aren't hallucinating over the man-made global-warming madness (i.e., Mexico, all of Asia, etc.).
That Mr. Krupp can extol this plan while the EPA violates the Constitution and the rights of states shows clearly that the Obama administration is really no different than the late Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. And then Mr. Krupp extols the U.S. agreement with China where they both agreed to setting climate goals. He fails to mention that China isn't going to start to reduce CO2 levels until 2030.
Mr. Krupp states "millions of Americans joined the fight for these standards." Who are these millions of Americans? They sure aren't people who care about manufacturing jobs, electrical bills, governance by fiat or upholding the Constitution.

This plan trades U.S. economic loss in the next several years for vague economic gains in future decades. The truth is that this federal government takeover of our energy economy will have no significant effect on global climate change.

Mr. Krupp mentions that clean-energy investments create three times as many jobs per dollar invested as fossil-fuel investments. This is a bad thing. If energy can be created with fewer laborers, those laborers can pursue more productive endeavors elsewhere in the economy, while paying less for energy. Investments in sweatshops where laborers sew by hand "deliver" more jobs per dollar than investments in sewing machines.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's announcement Monday of an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions from U.S. power plants launched what will be a monthslong push that the administration hopes culminates in a global climate accord later this year.
While the first-ever limits on carbon emissions are a crucial component of the president's domestic agenda, the regulations also are integral to Mr. Obama's efforts to position the U.S. as a leader on the world stage. Nearly 200 countries are working toward completing a climate deal in Paris in December. The issue also is expected to be high on the agenda when Mr. Obama meets with Pope Francis next month, on the heels of a papal encyclical calling for a cultural revolution to combat climate change.
U.S. power plants account for just 5% of global carbon emissions. But administration officials have said that if the U.S. leads on this issue, other nations would follow, and the new plan allows the president to show progress at home.
"If we don't do it, nobody will. The only reason that China is now looking at getting serious about its emissions is because they saw that we were going to do it, too," Mr. Obama said Monday at the White House. "When the world faces its toughest challenges, America leads the way forward."
The limits on carbon emissions are a central component of the U.S.'s pledge to its international partners to cut greenhouse gases by a range of 26% to 28% by 2025, from 2005 levels. The final Environmental Protection Agency rule requires a 32% cut in power-plant carbon-dioxide emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels, which is a more ambitious target than the draft rules proposed last year.
In the absence of a plan to cut carbon-dioxide emissions in the U.S., the president would have a "difficult row to hoe" as he seeks cooperation of other world leaders, said Heather Zichal, a former Obama adviser on energy and climate change.
"You've now got Obama going to Paris with a plan that has aggressive emissions reductions," she said. "Without that, I don't see how the United States would be credible."
Republicans, though, have criticized both the emissions regulations and the president's push for an international pact. When the administration struck a climate agreement with China in November, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other Republicans said the deal made China do nothing until at least 2030 and that U.S. regulations would hurt America's economy much sooner.
Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said Monday that the administration's rules wouldn't meaningfully affect the global climate, adding that "they could actually end up harming the environment by outsourcing energy production to countries with poor environmental records like India and China."
Mr. Obama has been pointing toward Paris for months, framing the negotiations as a historic opportunity to complete a pact with nearly 200 nations and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions world-wide. He has put the issue front and center in his talks with world leaders, building consensus on climate action at the Group of Seven summit in June and securing new commitments from Brazil earlier this summer.
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said Monday that China is pursuing climate initiatives on its own and praised its relationship with the U.S. on this issue.
Whether Mr. Obama will win enough political support for his plan at home -- as well as legal rulings upholding the EPA rule -- remains a question. Even if the president prevails on the domestic front, that doesn't guarantee success internationally.
Norine Kennedy, vice president for environment and energy for the United States Council for International Business, said the administration's ambition in reducing carbon emissions is commendable. But thorny issues, such as agreeing on a plan to verify countries' emissions cuts and finding sources of money to aid developing countries in reducing emissions, still must be resolved before Paris, she said.
Many Republicans and other opponents have said they would explore ways to warn other countries that the president might not be able to deliver on his promises to slash emissions. Some also are pursuing legal and legislative strategies aimed at derailing the EPA regulations, which could prove problematic for meeting the U.S.'s international commitments.
A group of 15 state attorneys general said minutes after Mr. Obama's announcement of the rule that they intend to file a lawsuit challenging it. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) said a Senate committee would soon take up legislation she has sponsored to delay the rule's compliance deadlines until all litigation is resolved and give governors the ability to opt out of the plan if they determine the rule would crimp their economy or reliability of the electric grid.
Experts also said a GOP win in the 2016 presidential election could call into question the regulations' long-term prospects and the U.S.'s Paris commitments.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A new rule mandating the first-ever federal limits on power-plant carbon emissions aims to change the way Americans make and consume electricity, accelerating a shift already under way toward cleaner fuels, renewable energy and consumer-generated power.
The regulations, which will be unveiled by President Barack Obama at a White House event Monday, are part of a broader push by the administration to position the U.S. as a leader in tackling climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency regulations are central to the administration's submission to an international climate conference set for December in Paris.
White House officials say Mr. Obama views addressing climate change as part of his legacy. He announced an aggressive climate deal with China in November and has put the issue high on the agenda in meetings with world leaders in recent months. The president also will discuss climate change with Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. next month, following the pope's release of an encyclical on the issue in June.
"This rule enhances in important ways our ability to achieve the international commitments that we have made," Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, told reporters Sunday.
But divisions at home cast some doubt on the administration's ability to fully implement the regulations, which were released in draft form a year ago.
Industry officials say they are worried about the plan's cost and timetable. Republicans in Congress and states hardest hit by the plan say they will fight it. More than a dozen states and the coal industry have vowed to sue the EPA, and several states have threatened to refuse to comply with the rule.
The rule would require a 32% cut in power-plant carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels, an increase from the 30% target proposed last year. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said Sunday the rule would result in an estimated annual cost of $8.4 billion by 2030 and have total benefits, including public-health benefits, of $34 billion to $54 billion per year by then.
The regulations require states to draft their own plans to reduce power-plant emissions to reach an overall carbon reduction target nationwide. States would have to put in place compliance plans by 2018 and meet their first targets for reductions by 2022. As with the draft rule released last year, the EPA would impose a federal plan on states that don't comply, according to the administration.
The final rule calls for the nation to get 28% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2030, versus roughly 13% last year. Industry experts say cutting carbon emissions 32% by 2030 will require billions of dollars in investments for new transmission lines that accommodate more solar and wind power and new pipelines to feed natural-gas-fired power plants, as coal becomes less important as a fuel.
U.S. electric utilities have already taken steps to shift to less carbon-intensive fuels, and they worry about the degree to which their whole system will need to be upgraded to accommodate more renewable energy, much of it generated by customers with solar panels or other equipment.
The industry, experts said, expects to spend more than $100 billion next year on capital projects, and will adjust its spending programs to reflect the new rules even as court challenges proceed.
"Utilities already are moving in that direction by retiring coal plants and adding renewables," said Nick Akins, chief executive of Ohio-based American Electric Power Co., one of the nation's biggest utilities, which has been a major user of coal. Though some states may object to the EPA rule, he said, most utilities "will be reaching out to our states and be very factual and objective and see if we can comply."
Executives worry about the EPA plan's cost, in part because it could result in shutting power plants that aren't yet paid off, Mr. Akins said, meaning consumers will have to pay for assets that aren't providing benefits.
Administration officials said Sunday they had taken industry concerns into account in the year since the draft was released. Most significantly, the final rule pushes back the first year that states must begin complying, to 2022 from 2020.
In another nod to industry concerns, the final rule would help encourage nuclear power generation, which doesn't emit any carbon and accounts for about 20% of the U.S.'s electricity.
Nuclear reactors under construction in Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia will get credit toward compliance with the rule, a change from the proposal, according to the administration. Nuclear plants that boost their output also will get more credit.
One industry concern is the final rule seeks to prevent a wholesale shift to natural gas. Over the past few years, utilities have been burning more gas, which produces 50% less carbon emissions than coal but still more than zero-emitting sources like wind and nuclear power. That shift has been helped along by the domestic boom in gas production since 2008 aided by new drilling methods such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.
The 2014 draft rule relied on a large and early shift from coal to natural gas. The final regulations would remove that assumption and instead create a new program to encourage states to deploy more renewable energy and energy efficiency by giving credits toward compliance on such projects that begin construction early on.
Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said the rule would increase utility consumption of natural gas by 7.1 billion cubic feet a day, or 32%, enough to lift national demand for it by about 10%. The big loser -- the coal industry -- will see consumption drop 23% by 2020, adding to the crisis already rocking mining. Some opponents have labeled the rule a "war on coal."
"We'll hear the same tired plays from the same special-interest playbook, but the American people know better," Ms. McCarthy said.
To date, states including California and nine in the Northeast have been in the minority in devising programs to trim carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change.
The new rule "will act like an accelerant," said Ted Craver, chief executive of California-based Edison International, parent of Southern California Edison. "Now all the states will have to grapple with the need to reduce carbon emissions."
Electric-grid operators would need to make sure their systems can handle power flowing from decentralized sources, such as millions of rooftop solar systems and thousands of wind turbines.
Utilities have been shutting coal plants for several years to satisfy other EPA rules. Since 2011, Duke Energy Corp. says it has retired 40 older coal units in the Carolinas and the Midwest and replaced them with super-efficient coal units or gas-fired plants at a total cost of $9 billion.

Companies to Vow
To Cut Emissions
More than a dozen U.S. companies on Monday will pledge to invest more than $140 billion in efforts to cut carbon emissions as part of a new Obama administration initiative leading up to the United Nations climate change summit later this year.
Bank of America Corp., General Motors Co., Cargill Inc. and Alcoa Inc. are among the companies set to sign onto a pledge to address climate change at a White House event Monday with Secretary of State John Kerry and White House adviser Brian Deese.
Monday's announcement, which also includes tech giants Google Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., is one part of an expansive effort by the Obama administration to address climate change and make it a legacy of President Barack Obama's time in the White House.
As soon as next week, the Environmental Protection Agency is set to issue final rules cutting carbon emissions from U.S. power plants.

VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS
Workers in Nine States
Take a Strike Vote
Verizon Communications Inc. workers in nine states have voted to go on strike if necessary over a dispute about a new contract, a union official said at a rally on Saturday.
"Our members are clear and they are determined," said Dennis Trainor, an official with the Communications Workers of America union. "They reject management's harsh concessionary demands."
At the rally in New York, the CWA said that 86% of Verizon workers who voted in a recent poll backed strike action if required.
The contract covers employees in nine states from Massachusetts to Virginia who work for Verizon's wireline business, which provides fixed-line phone services and FiOS Internet service. It also affects wireline workers in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, as well as in Washington, D.C.
Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the company had made the unions "a solid proposal that recognizes the changing communications landscape and offers a path toward success."

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES
U.S. Seeks Damages
In Sikorsky Inquiry
The Justice Department is seeking up to $148 million in damages and fines from United Technologies Corp. over allegations that units of its helicopter business overbilled the U.S. Navy for spare parts.
The company had previously disclosed the complaint against two subsidiaries of Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter unit. In a filing Friday, United Technologies said it was notified July 13 that the Justice Department had opened a criminal complaint into the matter.
Sikorsky makes helicopters for commercial and military use, including the Black Hawk.
The investigation comes as United Technologies hopes to complete its announced sale of Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin Corp. for $9 billion. United Technologies said it is cooperating fully and doesn't think it is likely to lose the case.
A Lockheed Martin spokesman said: "We were made aware of the issue during our due diligence and negotiation process and we will continue to monitor the issue in close collaboration with UTC."
At issue is whether the two units of Sikorsky were within their rights to include profit and overhead in billings to the Navy from 2006 to 2012, when the company had a contract to supply spare parts for two types of fixed-wing training aircraft.

Full text:   Corrections & Amplifications
Two internal government watchdogs and the State Department are arguing over whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, during her time in office, sent or received emails containing then-classified information on her personal email server. A U.S. News article Monday about the emails incorrectly called it an intergovernmental argument.
(WSJ July 29, 2015)
A third batch of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails is scheduled to be released this week despite warnings from internal government watchdogs that "hundreds of potentially classified emails" could be among them and a conclusion that the State Department already had posted classified material publicly as part of previous email releases.
The next tranche of Mrs. Clinton's emails is set to be posted Friday by the State Department, the third significant release of emails from Mrs. Clinton's time in office from 2009 until 2013. The release highlights the intergovernmental argument about whether she sent or received information that was classified at the time on her personal email server.
In another development that is likely to further the dispute about her use of a personal server rather than the government system, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman said Saturday that she plans to testify in October before the Republican-led panel investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
Republicans on the Benghazi Select Committee are expected to question Mrs. Clinton about both the Benghazi attack, as well as her email server arrangement. Mrs. Clinton's spokesman said the Democratic presidential front-runner would answer questions on both topics during the public hearing. Republicans on the panel said a firm date had not yet been set.
Last week, an inspector general probe concluded that Mrs. Clinton had then-classified material stored on her own personal server. A State Department spokesman stood by the department's longtime assertion that no material sent or received by Mrs. Clinton was classified at the time it was transmitted, and that the department sometimes needs to retroactively classify information. He said that "to our knowledge, none of them [the emails] needed to be classified at the time."
On a campaign swing in Iowa over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton told reporters, "The facts are pretty clear: I did not send nor receive anything that was classified at the time."
A probe by the Intelligence Community Inspector General found four emails in a small sample of the total emails in Mrs. Clinton's archive that contained information that was classified when they were sent and remains classified to this day.
In a letter last week, the inspector general complained about the vetting process used to clear the emails and about the classified information contained in Mrs. Clinton's communications.
The inspector general's office said Sunday that it couldn't discuss whether the classified material it found was sent or received -- or both -- using Mrs. Clinton's server.
"We carefully used 'transmit' to not indicate either sent or received," said a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office.
A Wall Street Journal report said the inspector general had concluded Mrs. Clinton sent four emails using her personal email server that contained classified information.
In a statement released Friday and cosigned by the State Department inspector general, the intelligence inspector general concluded: "This classified information should never have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system."
Mrs. Clinton has insisted that her email arrangement was legal and that she has turned over all her work-related material to the State Department. She also has maintained that she knew the classification laws during her time in office and didn't violate them.
On Sunday in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton sought to elevate the issue of climate change in the presidential race as she announced two "bold national goals" to expand clean-energy production. She pledged she would take steps to ensure that within a decade, the U.S. would produce enough clean, renewable energy to power every home in the country. And she set a target of half a billion solar panels installed in the U.S. by the end of her first term.
The announcements were the start of what the Clinton campaign said would be a months-long rollout of a broader energy and climate strategy. The focus on these issues allows Mrs. Clinton seeks to draw sharp contrasts with GOP presidential candidates.
Republican presidential candidates have voiced varying degrees of skepticism about whether human activity plays a role in climate change. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), for example, has compared those who have raised concerns about climate change to "flat-Earthers."

Attacker Steals Gun
From Off-Duty Officer
An off-duty New York City police officer was attacked and robbed of her service revolver inside her Bronx apartment building early Wednesday, police said.
The 41-year-old officer was in the building's elevator around 5 a.m. when the door opened, a man entered, grabbed a gold chain from her neck and demanded her wallet.
As the officer reached into her purse, which contained her gun, the suspect punched her in the face and fled with the weapon, said NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce.

Full text:   Regarding former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's "Realistic Goals for the Paris Climate Conference" (op-ed, June 29): The Paris process is reaching out to embrace other efforts to address climate change. This includes efforts to reduce conventional air pollution -- black carbon soot and urban smog -- which saves lives today and cuts the rate of climate change in half tomorrow. It also includes phasing down hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants under the Montreal Protocol. This effort was initiated by low-lying countries concerned with rising sea levels and more powerful storm surges, and is now being championed by the Africa group of 55 countries, as well as the U.S. and Europe.
If agreed this November when the Montreal Protocol parties meet, the HFC amendment would provide on the order of 10% of the mitigation needed to stay below the 2 degrees C guardrail that, if surpassed, will bring dangerous and potentially irreversible climate impacts.
Further mitigation would come from efficiency gains in room air conditioners catalyzed by the phase down of the refrigerants. This could potentially double the climate prize and would be a sizable down payment for the Paris agreement.
The past success of the Montreal Protocol wasn't easy as chemical companies invested in CFCs fought for several years to discredit the science, which later won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for Mario Molina, Sherwood Rowland and Paul Crutzen. But Mayor Bloomberg is correct that focusing on a specific part of the climate problem with a tailor-made solution, as the Montreal Protocol does, is easier than trying to solve the whole of climate change in one go.

Our best hope for the United Nations climate change conference in Paris is that absolutely nothing happens. Mr. Bloomberg holds up Portugal as one of the economic powerhouses we should try to emulate with clean energy. Portugal has an unemployment rate of 13%, with a much higher unemployment rate for young adults. I would think a former mayor of New York would understand that what we really want are jobs and low taxes. We can all be sure that neither of those two things will be a goal or outcome of any climate conference.
The last time I was in New York City, I don't recall seeing any windmills or solar panels, and I certainly didn't see any New Yorkers protesting for the privilege of paying three times more for their electricity.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Cuba have reached an agreement to restore diplomatic relations and reopen embassies in each other's capitals, a senior administration official said Tuesday, the biggest step yet toward ending a half century of enmity between the two countries.
President Barack Obama plans to tell the nation on Wednesday that the U.S. will re-open its embassy in Havana, the official said, culminating a central aspiration of his presidency and representing the end of one of the last vestiges of the Cold War more than a quarter century after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Secretary of State John Kerry will color in details of the U.S. effort, speaking from Vienna on Wednesday about the move to convert the diplomatic post in Havana, known as the U.S. Interests Section, into a full embassy, officials said. He is expected to travel to Cuba in July to oversee the embassy's reopening.
U.S. and Cuban leaders stunned the world in December by announcing they would move to normalize relations, setting off a six-month scramble to overcome differences. They held four rounds of talks to re-establish diplomatic ties, with the last meeting in Washington in May. Cuba late that month was formally removed from Washington's list of sponsors of state terrorism, a critical step toward restoring diplomatic ties.
The expected announcement Wednesday will be the most concrete development to come out of the U.S. policy shift on Cuba. While Mr. Obama has taken several unilateral steps to advance ties, including removing Cuba from the terrorism list, the latest move is the product of bilateral conversation.
"It's a big milestone," said Ted Piccone, a Cuba expert at the Brookings Institution. "This is the first thing we've seen since the Dec. 17 agreement that says, 'We're jointly agreeing to this step.'"
Officials at the Cuban Interests Section in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment.
Obama administration officials see the re-establishment of diplomatic ties as the first step in a longer normalization process. Congress would need to act to fully remove an embargo on trade and travel that has been in place since the early 1960's, though Mr. Obama took steps to loosen restrictions in December.
The State Department must formally notify Congress of its intent to reopen the embassy in Havana. Congress then has 15 days to review the notification before the U.S. can go ahead and formally do so.
U.S. officials have said that the formal announcement of the reopening of the embassy and the notice to Congress would come together.
The announcement is a major victory for Mr. Obama, who has supported renewed relations with Cuba since his 2008 presidential campaign and made the issue a core component of his second-term foreign policy agenda.
The U.S.-Cuba breakthrough comes on the heels of a hard-fought congressional vote last week to give Mr. Obama the authority to negotiate a new trade pact with 11 Asia-Pacific nations.
It comes days before the expected finalization of another plank of Mr. Obama's second-term agenda -- a deal with Iran to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Mr. Obama also gained on Tuesday a commitment from Brazil to buy into another administration priority: a global climate change agreement he hopes to reach by the end of the year.
All four policy initiatives, while controversial among Democrats and Republicans, were part of a far-reaching agenda Mr. Obama set in late 2012 after winning re-election. Mr. Obama had long supported the efforts but largely held back from pursuing them in his first term because of political calculations and economic restraints.
Mr. Obama, who met in April with Cuban President Raul Castro at the Summit of the Americas, is expected to become the first sitting president to visit Cuba in nearly 60 years. Aides have said he wants to travel there and is likely to do so before leaving office in January 2017.
On Tuesday, during a news conference with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Mr. Obama said he hopes the new U.S. policy creates "more opportunities and prosperity for the Cuban people."
But news of the expected announcement drew jeers from U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R.-Fla.), a critic of Mr. Castro. "There was little doubt that the Obama administration would pursue its goal of opening an embassy in Cuba no matter the sad reality on the ground," she said. "Opening the American Embassy in Cuba will do nothing to help the Cuban people and is just another trivial attempt for President Obama to go legacy shopping."
The U.S. relationship with Cuba is destined for the 2016 presidential campaign. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), a Cuban-American and a 2016 presidential candidate, is leading efforts to ensure the U.S. economic embargo holds. He also has said he'll oppose the nomination of any ambassador to Cuba unless he sees progress on human rights, the return of fugitives held in Cuba, the resolution of property claims and removal of restrictions of U.S. diplomats in Cuba.
The question of U.S.-Cuba ties also will heat up in Congress, with several Cuba-related bills coming to life, including a measure by Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) to lift the embargo against travel to the island. The measure has 45 co-sponsors.
"This is the first step that must happen in order to lift the embargo," Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), a co-sponsor of the travel bill and author of a bill to lift the trade embargo, said of the diplomatic step in an interview.
The U.S. embassy building, constructed in 1953 and occupying a prominent place by the Malecon, the famous seaside drive, has been a focus for tensions between the two countries, and a rallying point for the Cuban regime, which habitually called it a "nest of spies." The U.S. closed its embassy when the two countries broke relations in 1961. The building opened as the U.S. Interests Section in 1977 when then President Jimmy Carter tried to re-establish normal diplomatic relations with Cuba.
Hundreds of thousands of Cubans, many waving small paper flags, would march past the worn building shouting revolutionary slogans on May Days. Most had little choice but to participate in the parade since omnipresent neighborhood watch committees kept notes on who marched and who didn't.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Brazil pledged to work toward new commitments to reduce the impact of climate change, extolling a revived relationship during a long-delayed visit by the Brazilian leader.
Tuesday's climate announcement marks a modest step forward in President Barack Obama's effort to elicit agreements from world leaders in advance of a December meeting in Paris where he hopes to complete a global accord.
Mr. Obama met with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff at the White House, and the two also agreed to reduce trade barriers and extend cooperation in various fields, including military exchanges, human rights and cybersecurity.
The meeting between the U.S. and Brazilian presidents, however, was largely an opportunity for them to showcase a relationship on the mend. In 2013, a spying scandal derailed plans for a state visit, as Ms. Rousseff canceled a trip to Washington amid revelations that the National Security Agency had intercepted communications from the president and other Brazilian officials.
The two leaders met in Panama in April on the sidelines of a summit of leaders in the Americas. Tuesday's meeting was a step down from the more ceremonial state visit Ms. Rousseff canceled in 2013. But White House officials sought to play down any lingering discord. Mr. Obama described his relationship with his Brazilian counterpart as excellent. He said the U.S. regards Brazil "not as a regional power, but as a global power."
Ms. Rousseff said Mr. Obama has offered assurances that the U.S. government would no longer engage in intrusive acts of spying on friendly countries. She added that she has told Mr. Obama that if he needs information from Brazil, "pick up the phone and call me."
Brazil hasn't yet submitted its own climate-change plan, and Tuesday's announcement falls short of setting a formal target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. But the White House touted Brazil's pledge to announce a target this year as a victory.
Tuesday's announcement "reflects the strong commitment of the two presidents to reaching an ambitious climate-change agreement," said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama who focuses on climate change.
Both countries pledged to increase the share of renewable energy -- other than hydropower -- in their electricity-generation mixes to 20% by 2030. Brazil also committed to eliminating illegal deforestation and restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares by 2030.
The U.S. already has submitted a plan to cut greenhouse gases by 26% to 28% by 2025, based on 2005 levels.
Brazil has signaled support for the global effort to address climate change, but Brazilian officials have suggested that developed countries should shoulder more of the responsibility and should help poorer nations reduce emissions.

Full text:   President Barack Obama gathered his foreign policy team in the White House Situation Room several weeks after his 2012 re-election for a meeting to set his second-term agenda.
Now that he was free from the politics of another presidential campaign, Mr. Obama told the group, he wanted a "blue skies" assessment of all policies worth considering, according to participants. Nothing was off the table.
What emerged was a sweeping and fundamental re-orientation of U.S. foreign policy, highlighted by four initiatives: conclude a nuclear deal with Iran; renew diplomatic relations with Cuba; elevate climate change to a national-security issue; and complete a free-trade deal with Asia.
Mr. Obama's foreign-policy offensive, described by a dozen current and former U.S. officials involved in its execution, was a blueprint to fulfill the president's 2008 campaign pledge of breaking from decades of post-Cold War U.S. foreign-policy doctrine.
Together, the initiatives reflect Mr. Obama's belief that diplomatic and economic engagement trump military power in winning lasting American influence. David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama's closest advisers since the 2008 campaign, said the seeds of the president's second-term foreign-policy agenda "were planted from the very first days of the first term."
The effort has at times been rocky. All four initiatives have been controversial; in three of them -- Iran, Cuba and climate change -- Mr. Obama challenged Republicans and the foreign-policy establishment. And the trade deal set off a jarring collision with his own party.
Other problems have crowded the agenda and, in the eyes of critics, caught the president unprepared. China was a priority at the outset of the administration, but Beijing has repeatedly defied the White House, striking an aggressive posture in Asia, militarily and economically, that has alarmed U.S. allies.
Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a campaign of intimidation against Ukraine, after the administration sought a "reset" in relations in Mr. Obama's first term. Mr. Putin's moves threaten the cooperation with Moscow that the administration needs to achieve some of its other goals, including nuclear arms reduction. And the Iran initiative has kindled a firestorm in relations with Israel, which Mr. Obama has had to invest time and capital to contain.
"Russia, Iran and China are each in their own way trying to change the international status quo . . . All three are seeing the American-backed world order looking vulnerable," said Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College and scholar at the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. "So far, it doesn't seem like the Obama administration has succeeded in changing the thinking in any of these countries' capitals."
In addition, the administration seemed surprised by the rapid rise of Islamic State across Syria and Iraq. Presidential aides were alarmed last summer when Mr. Obama said publicly he had no strategy against the militants. The remark indicated he feared that Iraq, a problem he had hoped to put behind him, was returning to knock his agenda off its course.
The comment drew a torrent of criticism, which for the president was like "a splash of cold water on his face," one senior administration official said. Mr. Obama agreed to make a concerted effort to get back on course with his foreign-policy plan while elevating the fight against Islamic State on his priority list.
"He is looking at these issues and saying, 'Yes we have to deal with terrorism, we have to deal with security challenges in the Middle East, but we can't be consumed by that,' in part because that is not the issue or the region that's going to define the next 50 or 100 years," said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser.
Mr. Rhodes was dispatched by the president at the December 2012 foreign-policy meeting to begin clandestine talks with Cuba, an initiative that has since opened the door to restoring diplomatic relations with Havana.
Soon after the meeting, U.S. diplomats also expanded secret contacts with Iran that have brought Washington within days of a possible deal to curb Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.
Top White House officials say Mr. Obama's first term was largely defined by the global economic crisis, twin wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as political battles in Washington. But the president in his second term became more willing to butt heads with foreign allies and Democratic leaders.
Israel and the Arab states have publicly broken from the White House over the Iran talks, and many Democratic lawmakers have fought Mr. Obama over a trade deal with Asia that opponents say could hurt U.S. workers.
A second-term administration push to secure an Arab-Israeli peace, driven by Secretary of State John Kerry, failed.
"Every president has to live within the parameters of politics, and there's no doubt that there were limitations because of the last campaign," Mr. Axelrod said. "But I think he's actually been remarkably consistent, given that. He's feeling the pressures of time."
Some Republicans accuse the White House of pursuing an agenda that is weakening the U.S. and its allies, while splintering the Middle East. The emerging deal with Iran, they say, leaves that country still capable of making a nuclear weapon, while prompting such rivals as Saudi Arabia to seek their own bomb.
Mr. Obama also faces GOP criticism that he has failed to arrest moves to redraw international borders by Russia, as well as China. U.S. officials recently said China had positioned weapons on the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, the latest in a continuing dispute over territorial claims to the archipelago, located in one of the world's busiest shipping routes.
Relations were further strained this month after U.S. officials said they suspected Chinese hackers stole the personnel records of more than four million U.S. government workers.
Mr. Obama's foreign-policy initiatives have spilled into the 2016 presidential campaign. GOP contenders say they will tie former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, to Mr. Obama's record.
"It is up to our next president to right the wrongs done by the current one," Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), a Republican presidential candidate, told the Council on Foreign Relations last month. "It is up to our next president to properly fund and modernize our military. It is up to our next president to restore our people's faith in the promise and the power of the American ideal."
"We've made some dangerous mistakes in recent years," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said this month when announcing his 2016 presidential bid. "The Obama administration, and some of my colleagues in Congress, substituted wishful thinking for sound national security strategy."
White House officials say that Mr. Obama has bolstered U.S. standing overseas, in part by reducing the exercise of military power in favor of diplomacy.
Mr. Obama's foreign-policy ambitions date to the earliest days of his presidency, current and former advisers say. Two weeks before the 2008 election, Mr. Obama called foreign-policy experts, including his top Middle East adviser at the time, Dennis Ross, and the late State Department envoy, Richard Holbrooke, to a Chicago hotel to map out a first-term agenda.
Among Mr. Obama's priorities were winding down the war in Iraq and containing Afghanistan's Taliban, meeting participants said. Mr. Obama also wanted to engage Iran and its closest regional ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, reversing the tack of his predecessor, President George W. Bush.
Weeks after taking office, Mr. Obama sent the first of at least four letters to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling for better ties, U.S. officials said. He sent senior envoys to meet Mr. Assad's aides in Damascus. Neither Iran nor Syria embraced the overtures.
Other White House global objectives set in the first term, such as improving ties with Cuba, North Korea and Russia, lagged behind because of political resistance and changes in power in Pyongyang and Moscow.
The president's successes in his first term included the killing of Osama bin Laden and completion of New START, an updated nuclear arms-control treaty with Moscow that was signed before Mr. Putin reclaimed the Russian presidency.
Mr. Obama also withdrew all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011 and oversaw a significant drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan. Critics say the Iraq withdrawal allowed Islamic State to flourish. White House officials said Iraq rejected a continued U.S. military presence, leaving Mr. Obama no choice.
After Mr. Obama's 2012 re-election, he was determined to complete his campaign pledges, White House officials said, and felt he could take more political risks. Some of the sharpest criticism of Mr. Obama's outreach, including Iran, has come from Democrats.
Changes abroad also emboldened Mr. Obama, administration officials said. International sanctions on Iran, for example, cut Tehran's oil exports in half by late 2012, making Mr. Khamenei more likely, in the view of the White House, to negotiate on Iran's nuclear program. Also, the global economy stabilized, strengthening Mr. Obama's hand on trade. And Cuba's ruling Castro brothers became isolated following the death in early 2013 of Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan strongman who was their closest Latin American ally.
After Mr. Obama asked Mr. Rhodes to hold secret meetings with Cuban diplomats, officials from both governments met at hotels in Toronto and Ottawa for months before announcement of the talks in December.
The Iran nuclear negotiations required even more secret maneuvering. For nearly a year, beginning in March 2013, a team of U.S. negotiators met clandestinely with their Iranian counterparts in New York, Geneva and the Persian Gulf sultanate of Oman.
The Americans flew in unmarked government planes. At times, they narrowly missed running into State Department colleagues traveling in the same cities on separate business, according to participants in the Iran talks.
With Mr. Obama's climate-change policy goals hampered by a Republican-led Congress, the president moved to advance his proposals internationally. During a meeting at a California resort in June 2013, Mr. Obama pitched China's new president, Xi Jinping, on forging a climate deal between Washington and Beijing. That was followed by private meetings among aides and a secret presidential letter that yielded new commitments to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
When Mr. Obama's secret initiatives regarding Iran and Cuba finally surfaced, they were criticized for having been executed without the knowledge of such close U.S. allies as Israel, Saudi Arabia and Colombia.
"You have an administration that has become, in its thinking and decision-making process, very centralized, and perhaps the most centralized since Nixon and Kissinger," said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank.
The president relies on advisers largely bereft of the establishment personalities of his first term, who included Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Ross and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Mr. Obama has since amassed a staff with views often at odds with mainstream Washington, and more in line with his own thinking. They include Mr. Rhodes, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power and White House Mideast expert Robert Malley -- people who trace their connections back to Mr. Obama's first presidential campaign.
Mr. Malley, the National Security Council's top Middle East adviser, has argued for years that Washington needed to engage Iran and its proxies to stabilize the Mideast. His work before joining the White House team involved engaging members of Hamas and Hezbollah, both U.S.-designated terrorist organizations. That drew the ire of pro-Israel lobbying groups during the 2008 campaign and forced his resignation. Now, he is on the team negotiating with Iran.
Colin Kahl, Vice President Joe Biden's national security adviser, also backed engaging Iran before he joined the White House last year. "A deal might empower pragmatists by giving them a big win, potentially allowing them to claw back more influence on Iran's foreign policy and push domestic reform," he said last month.
The next few months could define Mr. Obama's foreign-policy legacy and shape U.S. national security for years, according to both the White House and its critics.
Mr. Obama is pushing for an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during talks this December in Paris, after netting China's commitment.
On Monday Mr. Obama signed legislation, passed by Congress last week, giving him authority to wrap up negotiations on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, the free-trade deal on the president's second-term foreign-policy agenda.
The president hopes to complete an agreement with Iran in coming days; negotiations will continue past Tuesday's deadline.
Last month, Mr. Obama hosted the leaders of six Arab countries at his presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., to tout the benefits of a nuclear deal with Iran.
Some warned Mr. Obama that lifting economic sanctions on Tehran, and releasing as much as $150 billion of its frozen oil money in the deal, would fuel instability. They argued Tehran would use the money to fund Hamas, Hezbollah and its allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Mr. Obama wasn't persuaded.
"The president seemed utterly convinced in his views," said one Arab official who was there.

Full text:   A carbon tax is one of the Obama administration's few pieces of unfinished business, so Sen. Chuck "Schumer's Carbon Tax Prediction" if Hillary Clinton is elected president and Democrats retake control of the Senate is no surprise (Review & Outlook, June 25).
A direct question from a reporter to Mrs. Clinton about her support of a carbon tax, followed by a yes or no response, might hurt her politically, but a qualified question and a response that emphasizes renewable-energy research support or public rebate checks would do her no harm and could help her. She isn't going to admit that a carbon tax is needed because Washington's revenue tank is running low. Consider, too, the younger generation of American voters who have been primed by years of climate-change dogma in schools. A recent Overheard column (Money & Investing, June 19) addresses the linkages among climate change, social media and demographics, observing that younger Americans are more receptive to technologies and policies that cut gasoline consumption.
It would seem, then, that the green trend is a voting friend of those who can twist a carbon tax into a climate-change abatement subsidy paid for by less-conscientious energy consumers. The underlying objective of securing an alternative revenue source for Washington will get lost in reporter and moderator smog.

'Green Bond' Sales Struggle --- Flat pace of new debt in the first part of 2015 disappoints, perplexes the market's supporters

Author: Cherney, Mike

Full text:   A flattening in "green bond" sales is highlighting the uncertainty facing the market for the debt, which is billed as financing projects that would mitigate climate change.
Green bonds have been sold all over the world in recent years and have helped pay for energy-efficient buildings, improvements to water and sewer systems and mass transit. As the market has grown, however, so have concerns about whether projects financed by green bonds are truly beneficial for the environment, and whether the companies, municipalities and banks that sell the bonds are using the money as promised.
The Climate Bonds Initiative, a nonprofit group in London that tracks the market, forecast $100 billion in new green bonds in 2015 after sales roughly tripled last year. But green-bond sales are about in line with last year's pace, with $18.3 billion sold as of Wednesday, compared with $20 billion in the first half of last year, according to the group. About $37 billion of green bonds were sold last year in total.
The sluggish sales come as the broader debt market is booming, with investors snapping up bonds that offer higher yields than the low rates on safe-government debt. Some analysts say heavy demand for regular bonds could be dissuading some issuers from selling green bonds, which typically need additional effort to show a project is environmentally friendly.
Even so, the flat pace of sales in the first part of 2015 from a year ago has disappointed and flummoxed the debt's supporters.
"It's been a bummer of a first quarter, and a bummer of a first five months really," said Sean Kidney, the group's chief executive officer, adding that green-bond sales still could hit $70 billion this year.
Bankers, investors and environmental groups are working to add clarity to the green-bond market. Mr. Kidney's group is rolling out an advisory service for issuers who want to sell green bonds but are unfamiliar with the market.
The Banking Environment Initiative, a group of financial institutions at the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, said this month that it will work with other organizations to "support the emergence of industry-level consensus on standards" for green bonds.
And in March, the International Capital Market Association, a trade group for banks, issuers and asset managers, updated a set of voluntary green-bond guidelines that were initially released last year. The guidelines recommend that an outside party review whether a green bond is appropriate and suggest issuers regularly report on their project's environmental impact.
The guidelines "focus on transparency and disclosure," said Marilyn Ceci, head of green bonds at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
The guidelines don't explicitly exclude any type of project from being financed with green bonds. Some investors have gone a step further. One investor group, coordinated by the nonprofit Ceres, supports adherence to the guidelines but said any project that helps perpetuate fossil-fuel uses or emissions might be better served with conventional bonds.
"The marketplace asks a lot of questions," said David Sand, chief investment strategist at Community Capital Management, which manages $2 billion and was part of the Ceres group. "The last thing that anybody, investment banker or issuer, wants to do is come to market with something that doesn't hold up to scrutiny."
To be sure, there are a few days left this month for deals before the first half of the year concludes, and new issuers have still tapped the market. Earlier in the year, German bank Berlin Hyp AG sold what was billed as the first green covered bond, a type of mortgage-backed security that is common in Europe. In the U.S., Morgan Stanley sold its first green bond, as did the city of Asheville, N.C.
Asheville was looking to sell a $50 million bond tied to water-system upgrades, including replacing asbestos water pipes with iron ones that help limit leaks, when its bankers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggested turning the bond green, said Barbara Whitehorn, the city's chief financial officer.
Ms. Whitehorn said Asheville didn't get an outside opinion on its green bond because it was "really clear in what the purpose was, that we're conserving water." But she said the city would consider it for a larger infrastructure project.
"I'm hoping over time that we'll get some more clear criteria," Ms. Whitehorn said. "I think the criteria right now are really amorphous. You can kind of say, 'Sure, it's green.'"

Full text:   HERSHEY
Confectioner Plans
To Cut 300 Positions
Hershey Co., hampered by sluggish chocolate sales in China, on Friday lowered its sales and earnings targets for the year and announced plans to cut about 300 jobs.
The maker of America's top-selling chocolate brand, Reese's, as well as its namesake candy bar, cited lower-than-expected chocolate growth in China in April and May. The candy company also has been struggling with sluggish sales in certain U.S. stores and international markets lately, on top of rising costs for ingredients such as dairy and cocoa.
As part of its efforts to grow its international business, Hershey said its finance chief, Patricia Little, would now head up mergers and acquisitions.
Hershey said it is also reassessing the value of Shanghai Golden Monkey, including the remaining 20% that the U.S. company is scheduled to buy in September. Hershey agreed to buy the Chinese candy maker in late 2013 for nearly $500 million.
For the year, Hershey said it now expects sales to grow 2.5% to 3.5%, down from its previous forecast for 4.5% to 5.5% growth.
The company also slashed its adjusted earnings forecast to $4.10 a share to $4.18 a share, down from its previous forecast of $4.30 a share to $4.38 a share.

KB HOME
Home Builder's Profit
Tops Expectations
KB Home on Friday reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue in its latest quarter, driven by increased demand.
The housing market has picked up recently, as the Commerce Department last week said groundbreakings surged to a seven-year high in April before falling 11% last month. Permits to build new homes surged 12% last month to an annual rate of 1.275 million, the highest since August 2007. Meanwhile, permits for apartment construction surged, while permits for single-family homes, a much broader segment, rose modestly.
For the fiscal second quarter ended May 31, KB Home posted earnings of $9.6 million, or 10 cents a share, down from $26.6 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 10% to $623 million. This beat Wall Street expectations of $619 million in revenue and earnings of 8 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Housing revenue rose 8% to $604.9 million, while land-sale revenue rose to $15.9 million from $2.6 million.

INTEGRATED SILICON
Chip Maker Receives
Another Sweetened Bid
Integrated Silicon Solution Inc. on Friday received an increased bid from Uphill, the consortium of Chinese investors that has been battling Cypress Semiconductor Corp. for the chip maker.
Uphill, led by Summitview Capital, is now offering $22 a share in cash, valuing the company at about $704 million. The offer is up from $21 a share and tops the $21.25 Cypress proposed Thursday.
The tug of war has been going on since March, when Uphill first proposed buying Integrated Silicon for $19.25 a share, or about $640 million.
Integrated Silicon on Friday set a special meeting on June 25 for shareholders to consider the latest offer.
The most recent Cypress bid included a "tick fee" of 10 cents a share for each additional quarter required to obtain regulatory approval. Integrated Silicon has expressed concerns over regulatory approval, but those issues were resolved.
Integrated Silicon's board said it considers the latest Uphill proposal the superior offer.
A representative for Cypress wasn't immediately available for comment.

BOOKS
Publishers Eye
Pope's Encyclical
The release of Pope Francis' impassioned encyclical on climate change last week sparked a flurry of media coverage and a question for the U.S. publishing industry: Who will issue it as a book?
The 183-page document, which the pontiff addresses to "every person living on this planet," attributes global warming to human activity and accuses the global market economy of plundering the Earth.
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has exclusive U.S. rights to publish the encyclical for 30 days. It is now available for preorder on the conference website for $13.95. The book, titled "On Care for Our Common Home," will be in stock on June 25, said Matthew Kilmurry, a conference spokesman.
After that, the book will be up for grabs, and could be released by multiple publishers. Contracts would be issued by the official publishing office of the Vatican, Libreria Editrice Vaticana.
Likely publishing contenders include Image, a Catholic imprint of Random House that published Pope Francis' apostolic exhortation, "The Joy of the Gospel"; and Melville House, which published the Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Torture.
Representatives for Image and Random House didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Dennis Loy Johnson, publisher of Melville House, said he already has reached out to the rights department of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

TAKATA
Eight Deaths Now
Linked to Air Bags
The death of a woman in a car crash in September has been linked to a faulty air bag made by Japanese parts supplier Takata Corp., bringing the total reported deaths connected to the faulty part to eight, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Honda Motor Co. said Friday.
Seven of those deaths were in the U.S.
Car makers have pledged to replace the air bags, made by Japanese parts supplier Takata Corp., in nearly 34 million vehicles, the largest auto recall in U.S. history. The defective air-bag inflaters can explode, sending shards and shrapnel into the vehicle.
Vehicles with the faulty air bags -- from Honda sport-utility vehicles to autos produced by Toyota Motor Corp., General Motors Co. and Daimler AG trucks -- represent almost 14% of the roughly 250 million vehicles on U.S. roads.

Abstract: An online survey conducted in China last November shows that the majority of respondents believed that "greater understanding" is the best means toward "harmonious coexistence between China and the U.S." Through dialogue, we gain better understanding of the concerns and expectations of the American people and deeper insight into the way the U.S. political system works.

Full text:   I have the honor of co-chairing the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Washington, D.C., this week. This meeting is of particular significance as it lays the groundwork for President Xi Jinping's state visit to the U.S. in September. We look forward to engaging in candid discussions with U.S. colleagues to achieve broader consensus, better solutions and mutual success.
The role of this dialogue has been commended by many, but unfortunately also criticized by some who see it as producing more accusations than results. The facts clearly prove otherwise. The dialogue has helped both countries identify and expand common interests and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.
For example, the talks were critical in kick-starting negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty that had been stalled since 1982. This breakthrough came in 2013 during the fifth round of the dialogue with the adoption of a pre-establishment national treatment clause, which means national treatment will apply to U.S. businesses as they establish a presence in China. We also adopted a "negative list" approach, which clearly details which sectors aren't covered in the treaty.
Climate change is another area where dialogue has achieved success. This is an issue where both countries have enormous shared interests and face daunting common challenges. The last three dialogue rounds focused on this issue and produced extensive common ground that paved the way for the historic Joint Statement on Climate Change announced by President Xi and President Obama during the latter's visit to China last November. Such progress also gave a strong boost to multilateral negotiations.
Maintaining a strategic dialogue has helped the U.S. and China effectively manage differences and minimize their impact on our relationship. Some may recall the motion in the U.S. a decade ago to impose a 27.5% punitive tariff on Chinese imports. Fortunately, both sides chose dialogue over confrontation and worked together to forestall a looming trade war.
Over the past decade China has been committed to market-based currency reforms, and the yuan has appreciated 35% against the U.S. dollar. The International Monetary Fund recently released a report stating that China's currency is "no longer undervalued." Currency reforms have also helped reduce China's current-account surplus from a high of 10% of GDP to 2% today. All of this means a big improvement in China's economic structure.
But trade is a two-way street. Many Chinese companies have long been frustrated by the high barriers the U.S. has imposed on investments from China, such as stringent security reviews. They've also found it difficult to obtain business visas. It is through dialogue that some of these concerns have been addressed by Washington. We look forward to more such positive steps.
Over the past six years, direct investment from Chinese companies to the U.S. has increased fivefold, creating more than 80,000 jobs across the country. With fewer obstacles to Chinese investment, imagine how much more can be achieved. A recent study by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and Rhodium Group found that Chinese investments in the U.S. now total nearly $50 billion and will increase to between $100 billion and $200 billion by 2020, creating between 200,000 and 400,000 jobs for U.S. workers.
An online survey conducted in China last November shows that the majority of respondents believed that "greater understanding" is the best means toward "harmonious coexistence between China and the U.S." Through dialogue, we gain better understanding of the concerns and expectations of the American people and deeper insight into the way the U.S. political system works.
Dialogue has also helped U.S. leaders and the public learn more about 21st-century China. For example, the fact that over 95% of Chinese businesses are privately owned or controlled, and that state-owned enterprises are responsible for their own operations, rather than being simply dictated to by the state.
Dialogue has thus been a two-way process of learning and adapting, which enables the two sides to approach issues in a more collaborative and effective manner. There are different ways of resolving differences and frictions, and dialogue is certainly the most cost-effective means for doing so.
The Strategic and Economic Dialogue is a sign of the growing maturity of China-U.S. relations. Bilateral trade has doubled over the past nine years. China has become one of the fastest-growing export markets for the U.S. and the U.S. an important investment destination for China. The convergence of interests has gone beyond many people's imagination. It is now such that neither could afford noncooperation or confrontation.
China-U.S. relations are facing a rare opportunity for development. Yet many challenges remain. Let's work together to strengthen bilateral relations for the benefit of our peoples and the world.

Full text:   ROME -- Pope Francis in his much-awaited encyclical on the environment offered a broad and uncompromising indictment of the global market economy, accusing it of plundering the Earth at the expense of the poor and of future generations.
In passionate language, the pontiff attributed global warming to human activity, blamed special interests for holding back policy responses and said the global North owes the South "an ecological debt."
The 183-page document, which Pope Francis addresses to "every person living on this planet," includes pointed critiques of globalization and consumerism, which he says lead to environmental degradation.
"The Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth," he writes.
The encyclical's severe language stirred immediate controversy, signaling the weight the pontiff's stance could have on the pitched debate over how to respond to climate change.
"Economic powers continue to justify the current global system where priority tends to be given to speculation and the pursuit of financial gain," he writes. "As a result, whatever is fragile, like the environment, is defenseless before the interests of the deified market, which become the only rule."
The Vatican published the document, titled "Laudato Si' " ("Be praised"), on Thursday.
In the encyclical, Pope Francis wades into the debate over the cause of global warming, lending high-profile support to those who attribute it to human activity.
A "very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climactic system," contributing to a "constant rise in the sea level" and an "increase of extreme weather events," he writes.
"Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it," he adds.
While acknowledging natural causes for climate change, including volcanic activity and the solar cycle, Pope Francis writes that a "number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity."
The pontiff goes on to argue that there is "an urgent need" for policies to drastically cut the emission of carbon dioxide and other gases and promote the switch to renewable sources of energy.
But the pope goes further by weaving his signature theme of economic justice and his vehement criticism of capitalism throughout the entire encyclical.
Pope Francis opens the encyclical, which includes extensive sections on the theology of creation, with a lament for man's sins against "Mother Earth": "We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder her at will. The violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life."
The pontiff later denounces past failures to enact bolder environmental policies."The failure of global summits on the environment makes it plain that our politics are subject to technology and finance. There are too many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected," he writes.
The Argentina-born pontiff, the first in history to hail from the Southern Hemisphere, writes that the North owes the South en ecological debt because "developing countries, where the most important reserves of the biosphere are found, continue to fuel the development of richer countries at the cost of their own present and future."
Samuel Gregg, a Catholic who serves as director of research for the Acton Institute, a conservative ecumenical think tank that advocates for a free market, took exception to the pope's economic premises, saying Pope Francis has "significant blind spots" with regard to market economies.
Pope Francis is likely to repeat his arguments about inequality and environmental degradation when he addresses a United Nations special summit on sustainable development in September in New York. He could also raise those topics earlier that week, in a scheduled speech to a joint session of Congress, where the issue of climate change is highly controversial along partisan lines.

Full text:   Some scientists said Pope Francis' encyclical on the environment, in which he attributes global warming to human activity, adds a moral and religious imperative to the scientific argument about the dangers of climate change.
In the 183-page document, which the Vatican published on Thursday, Pope Francis accused the global market economy of plundering the Earth at the expense of the poor and future generations.
"The pope more or less gets it right on the science," said Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But what struck me was his linking of environmental degradation to cultural, political and social decline. That's the most valuable part of the document because it says that climate change is not an isolated problem."
The encyclical echoes the view of many scientists that climate change will hit developing countries hardest. Nearly 40% of the world's Roman Catholics live in Latin America. Africa also has a large number of Catholics.
In the U.S., environmentalists welcomed the arrival of a powerful new ally into their ranks, arguing that the pope's moral authority was a powerful weapon in the ideological and political tussle over global warming.
"Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it," the pope wrote.
"By supporting the scientific consensus, the [pope's encyclical] could help convince some of the conservative element in the U.S. that has been skeptical," said Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change at the University of Leeds, England.
But politicians who have dismissed the notion that climate change poses any significant danger disagreed with the pope. Rick Santorum, a Catholic former U.S. senator and now presidential candidate said the pope should "leave science to the scientists."
In 2010, governments participating in a United Nation's meeting on climate change agreed that global emissions need to fall so that global temperature increases can be limited to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. In December, they will try to hash out a formal, legally binding global pact in Paris.

Full text:   [Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Who cares what an old man says about climate change? That was one reaction to the pope's green-tinged encyclical released on Thursday.
To which the obvious reply might be the world's more than one billion Catholics. Even so, it seems unlikely his call will prompt sudden mass adoption of solar panels and electric vehicles among even the devout.
That may miss the point. Kevin Book at ClearView Energy Partners, a consultancy, doesn't foresee the call spurring radical change. Yet he does raise the idea that rather than Pope Francis being at the vanguard of the environmental movement, his call may be a lagging indicator of climate change moving ever more into the mainstream of public debate. On that reading, it is less about what the pope wrote -- rather that he wrote at all. That is especially so when social media enables the almost instantaneous spread and debate of issues.
One force linking shifting opinions on matters like climate change and tools like social media is demographics. On the same day, a survey sponsored by Exxon Mobil was released by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. It asked consumers about their acceptance of different vehicle technologies. One interesting finding: While a majority of respondents said fuel economy was important to them, younger ones were more likely to say so. Moreover, younger respondents also ranked electric and plug-in hybrids more highly than older counterparts.
We shouldn't read too much into surveys. Neither, though, can oil companies and car makers making long-term investments ignore them. One implication is that younger drivers are simultaneously less enamored of car ownership than prior generations, while more open to technologies that cut gasoline consumption, including vehicle-sharing services.
For the oil and auto industries, the risks lie less in a letter from the old guard and more in the diffuse expressions of a younger generation.

Full text:   ROME -- Pope Francis calls global warming a major threat to life on the planet, says it is due mainly to human activity, and describes the need to reduce the use of fossil fuels as an urgent matter, in a published draft of a much-awaited upcoming letter on the environment.
The draft copy of "Laudato Si' " ("Be praised"), his encyclical on the environment, has been eagerly awaited by business, policy makers and environmental groups. It was published online on Monday by the Italian magazine L'Espresso, three days ahead of its scheduled publication date.
The Vatican said the posted text wasn't the final document, which would remain under embargo until Thursday, but it didn't say whether there were material differences between the draft and the final document.
An encyclical is widely considered one of the highest forms of papal writing, intended to explain and elaborate Catholic teaching.
"Laudato Si' " is addressed not only to Catholics but to "every person who lives on this planet," the pope wrote. In it, the pontiff related ecological concerns to his signature theme of economic justice, especially the gap in wealth between the global north and south.
In the draft, the pope wades into the debate over climate change, writing of a "very consistent scientific consensus that we are in the presence of an alarming warming of the climactic system."
He writes that there is an "urgent and compelling" need for policies that reduce carbon emissions, among other ways, by "replacing fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy."
While acknowledging that natural causes, including volcanic activity, play a role in climate change, the pope writes that "numerous scientific studies indicate that the greater part of global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide and others) emitted above all due to human activity."
The encyclical has acquired outsized importance in recent months, given the moral suasion and the popularity of Argentina-born Pope Francis, the first pontiff from the developing world and one who has been particularly vocal in his advocacy of the poor and criticism of big business. Moreover, the encyclical comes at a time when governments, investors, industry executives and environmentalists are debating policy measures to address climate change.
The pope's letter brings a new dimension to the wrangling over the issue. In 2013, a landmark United Nations report concluded that there was a 95% level of certainty that humans are responsible for most global warming and reiterated that a long-term planetary warming trend was expected to continue. The report said that air and oceans are getting warmer, ice and snow are less plentiful, and sea levels are rising. The U.N. report is believed to broadly reflect the views of most climate scientists.
Some other researchers, though, have remained skeptical about global warming and they remain unconvinced that human activity is the dominant cause.
Paul C. Knappenberger, a climate scientist with the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think tank, said the pope "goes too far in the perception that the changing of the climate leads to bad outcomes and necessarily needs some sort of immediate reaction."
Crucially, the pontiff's words are expected to bolster the case of scientists and politicians who are seeking a global pact aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and potentially avoiding significant additional warming of the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
The pope "is going to be reaching people that haven't thought about this," said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a Boston-based nonprofit group that works with more than 100 companies with investments totaling $13 trillion to address climate risks to their business.
In December, nearly 200 countries are expected to meet in Paris and sign the new climate change agreement. Earlier this year, Pope Francis -- who expressed disappointment at the failure of past international efforts to reach agreement on the issue -- said that he aimed to publish the encyclical in time to affect the Paris meeting.
The pope's encyclical also comes as oil companies are turning increasingly vocal on climate change amid rising scrutiny from investors and governments. Many are looking to influence the debate by proposing remedies, including the imposition of a carbon tax, that might have a lesser impact on their business than more wide-ranging changes being sought by some.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday took its first step toward regulating carbon emissions from airlines, one of a string of actions by the Obama administration expected this summer to address climate change with rules covering swaths of the U.S. economy.
The EPA issued a draft scientific assessment finding that carbon emissions from airlines contribute to climate change, laying the foundation for the agency to eventually regulate those emissions.
The EPA said Wednesday that any regulations, which won't be promulgated until possibly early 2017, would be implemented in coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization, a branch of the United Nations, which is drafting a global standard for airline carbon emissions.
Aviation today represents about 2% of total global carbon emissions, and global air travel is growing at about 5% each year, according to Boeing Co., outpacing industry improvements in reducing its carbon footprint. The U.S. is the largest contributor to global aviation greenhouse gases.
The industry has long expected to face new regulations on carbon emissions, and manufacturers have urged a global approach, for fear of uneven regulation for a product that is designed to cross borders.
Airlines for America, the trade association representing U.S. airlines and air cargo carriers, said it was pleased that the EPA was working within the coming ICAO framework to develop a global carbon standard for new aircraft.
"Aviation is a global industry, making it critical that aircraft emission standards continue to be agreed upon at the international level," said Nancy Young, the group's vice president for environmental affairs.
In 2009, the International Air Transport Association, a global trade group, agreed to achieve carbon-neutral growth by 2020, meaning any future growth in air travel wouldn't produce a net increase in carbon emissions. Then, from 2020 through 2050, the industry aims to reduce its 2005 emission levels by half, largely through the use of sustainable fuels.
Boeing's efforts with industrial and academic partners to cultivate biofuel and so-called green diesel fuels are "how we retain our license to grow as an industry," said Juile Felgar, Boeing's managing director of environmental strategy. A Boeing spokesman said it would review the EPA's report.
Wednesday's EPA announcement, like other Obama administration climate moves, is likely to face congressional and legal challenges. Republican lawmakers decried the jet-fuel rule as more evidence of President Barack Obama's regulatory overreach.
"Aviation emissions aren't a risk to the Americans and their jobs, but the EPA is," said Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.).
Environmentalists applauded Wednesday's news.
"We have efficiency standards to reduce climate pollution from cars, trucks, and even school buses. It's time we reduce climate pollution from airplanes, too," said Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund.
The EPA's move Wednesday was prompted by a lawsuit brought by environmentalists in 2010 urging the government to regulate aircraft carbon emissions. The scientific finding and future regulatory action don't include military aircraft.
The EPA didn't announce a timetable for proposing the rules. Instead, the agency asked for public comment about the scope of the regulations and how the agency should work with ICAO, the U.N. body. The agency is expected to issue a final scientific finding, along with more details about next steps for the future rules, by spring 2016.
Still undecided is whether ICAO's rules would regulate the emissions of previously certified aircraft or only apply to all-new aircraft certified after a certain date.

Full text:   The Obama administration is planning a series of actions this summer to rein in greenhouse-gas emissions from wide swaths of the economy, including trucks, airplanes and power plants, kicking into high gear an ambitious climate agenda that the president sees as key to his legacy.
The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce as soon as Wednesday plans to regulate carbon emissions from airlines, and soon after that, draft rules to cut carbon emissions from big trucks, according to people familiar with the proposals. In the coming weeks, the EPA is also expected to unveil rules aimed at reducing emissions of methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- from oil and natural-gas operations.
And in August, the agency will complete a suite of three regulations lowering carbon from the nation's power plants -- the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's climate-change agenda.
The proposals represent the biggest climate push by the administration since 2009, when the House passed a national cap-and-trade system proposed by the White House aimed at reducing carbon emissions.
Anticipating the rules, some of which have been telegraphed in advance, opponents of Mr. Obama's regulatory efforts are moving to block them. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), is urging governors across the country to defy the EPA by not submitting plans to comply with its rule cutting power-plant emissions.
Nearly all Republicans and some Democrats representing states dependent on fossil fuels say the Obama administration is going beyond the boundary of the law and usurping the role of Congress by imposing regulations that amount to a national energy tax driven by ideological considerations.
"The Administration seems determined to double down on the type of deeply regressive regulatory policy we've already seen it try to impose on lower-and-middle-class families in every state," Mr. McConnell said in a statement. "These Obama administration regulations share several things in common with the upcoming directives: they seem motivated more by ideology than science, and they're likely to negatively affect the economy and hurt both the cost and reliability of energy for hard-working American families and small-business owners."
Supporters of Mr. Obama's efforts say the regulatory push has the backing of both science and the force of law. They cite a 2007 Supreme Court decision that compelled the EPA to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions if the agency found they endanger the public's health and welfare, which the EPA did in 2009 with a scientific finding shortly after Mr. Obama became president.
They also argue the moves became necessary after the Senate in 2010 rejected the administration proposal to cap the amount of carbon emitted in the U.S. Mr. Obama in 2013 issued an executive order directing the EPA to issue the regulations, which it did a year later, in June 2014.
"It's a demonstration of his commitment. He tried one path, it wasn't successful, so he took another path that was available," said Carol Browner, Mr. Obama's top climate adviser for the first two years of his administration and EPA administrator for President Bill Clinton.
The actions expected as soon as this week include a scientific finding concluding that carbon emissions from aircraft contribute to climate change, a move that legally prompts the requirement to regulate based on the 2007 ruling by the Supreme Court, and new carbon-emission standards for big trucks and trailers, such as a typical 18-wheeler semi-truck.
Two factors are driving the timing of the push this summer. The administration wants to complete it ahead of December's United Nations summit on climate change, where world leaders will meet in Paris to decide whether to agree on a global accord to cut carbon emissions. The EPA's regulatory agenda represents nearly everything Mr. Obama is set to offer world leaders on what the U.S. is doing to address climate change.
Secondly, once the EPA rules on emissions by power plants become final, states will have a year to submit plans while lawsuits challenging the rule are expected to be heard by the courts. The administration wants to make sure that its officials can oversee as much of these two developments as possible instead of relying on the next president, especially if it is one of the GOP White House candidates who have expressed opposition to the EPA's climate agenda altogether.

Full text:   Paul H. Tice's "Schoolroom Climate Change Indoctrination" (op-ed, May 28) is an attempt to drag science teachers and science education into the muddy world of climate-change politics by taking swipes at new science standards being embraced by educators nationwide.
Mr. Tice refers to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) as the "federally driven green Common Core." Let's be clear, NGSS aren't Common Core. There was no federal funding to develop, adopt or implement the NGSS. The science standards were developed with unprecedented involvement and support from scientists and educators, including members of my organization, the National Science Teachers Association.
The NGSS reflect decades of research on how students learn science. They are based on the Framework for K-12 Science Education, which was developed by the National Academy of Sciences, an organization that has been independent since it was created in 1863.
The science standards aren't curricula; they are statements about what students should be able to do at the end of instruction. Districts, schools and science teachers will determine how to implement the standards and have total control over the resources they use for classroom instruction.
Science teachers aren't working to "indoctrinate young people" about climate-change policy as Mr. Tice claims. They are using the NGSS to improve our nation's competitive position by educating the next generation of savvy, educated consumers of science and critical-thinking citizens.

Full text:   Global warming hasn't slowed during this century, a new study concludes, contrary to previous analyses that pointed to a pause in the rise of global temperatures.
Earlier observations showed that global surface temperatures increased by an average of 0.1 degree Celsius per decade from 1950-1999, a rise scientists believe stemmed from a surge in greenhouse-gas emissions linked to human activity. But puzzlingly, for the period 1998-2014 the warming rate was recorded at a slower 0.06 degrees per decade even though greenhouse-gas emissions continued to rise.
That apparent slowdown has been seized upon by skeptics of man-made climate change and sparked debate about how long the pause might last.
But the latest study, published Thursday in the journal Science, suggests that previous research wasn't accurate because of irregularities in how some temperatures are measured at land and sea. In the new analysis, the researchers tried to account for them and bolstered the earlier measurements with fresh temperature data from around the globe.
"We found that the rate of warming over the past 15 years was no different than the rate of warming in the second half of the 20th century," said Thomas Karl, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center.
The latest research is unlikely to be the last word on the global-warming pause. "The work itself is solid . . . but I would be cautious about the authors' statement that their study doesn't support the notion of a slowdown," said Peter Stott, a climate scientist at the Met Office, the U.K.'s national weather center.

Full text:   PARIS -- Europe's largest oil companies on Tuesday came out forcefully against coal, taking aim at a competing fossil fuel as they push cleaner-burning natural gas ahead of climate-change talks.
Executives from Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC, Total SA and others told industry officials at a conference that their increased production of gas could help reduce carbon emissions and lessen the world's reliance on coal for heating homes and creating electricity. Coal, they said, is a pollutant that sets back environmental efforts.
"Together with renewable energies it is important to promote the use of gas to replace coal," Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said. "It would contribute at a low cost to meet carbon-emissions targets."
The message was delivered at the World Gas Conference in Paris six months before United Nations climate-change talks that could result in an agreement to curb carbon emissions and limit global warning.
Shell, BP and other big European oil companies sent a joint letter to the U.N. this week calling for measures to push up the cost of burning coal, which remains fairly cheap. The companies suggest governments could either tax carbon emissions directly or reduce the supply of carbon-emission credits, required to offset emissions, to make those credits pricier on the secondary market.
The lobbying effort comes as gas becomes a bigger revenue source for top oil companies.
For instance Shell now produces more gas than crude oil and the Anglo-Dutch company is set to solidify its position on top of the liquefied-natural-gas market with its $70 billion deal to buy U.K. gas company BG Group PLC, which is expected to close next year. Approximately half of BP's production is natural gas and this could increase to 60% by the end of the decade, according to CEO Bob Dudley.
The coal industry has defended the fossil fuel's role in the energy mix, with backers saying that natural gas also emits greenhouse gases and that advanced technologies can sharply reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.
"It's flawed to think that you'll reach a solution to climate change without talking about low-emission technology for coal," Mick Buffier, chairman of the World Coal Association and an executive at Glencore PLC's coal unit, said in an interview in London on Tuesday. Mr. Buffier said new technology for coal-fired power plants can cut carbon emissions more than 30%.
He said China and India, which consume most of the world's coal, will continue to rely on it for power generation for decades. "The reality is that coal will continue to be used, particularly in developing countries," he said. He recommends that governments and development banks help fund low-emission technology for coal-fired power plants.
Long the world's dominant source of energy, coal will likely play a role for the foreseeable future. According to BP's World Energy Outlook, coal and gas are forecast in 2035 to each provide roughly the same amount of the world's energy -- just over 25%. Renewable-energy sources will increase but still be less than 10% by 2035, according to BP's annual tome of energy-industry forecasts.
Natural gas is still a fossil fuel, and burning it produces greenhouse gases blamed for climate change -- though much less of it, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The attack on coal comes as oil companies are stepping up their involvement in the climate-change debate before the U.N. summit later this year. The international gathering is intended to seal a deal that would ensure man-made global warming is limited to two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, but governments remain far apart on how to achieve this.
Environmental groups increasingly question whether all the resources that have been discovered can be burned if the world is to meet its climate-change goals. In response, the oil industry has begun acknowledging the issues presented by climate change, while also saying investment in fossil fuels must be made to meet the world's growing energy needs.
Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden is pushing for the industry to speak with a common voice on the measures it believes are necessary to encourage a shift to lower-carbon energy sources. The coalition of European energy companies on carbon pricing is one aspect. Mr. van Beurden also wants a broader coalition that includes utilities, academics, technology companies and others.

Full text:   In President Obama's May 20 speech at the Coast Guard Academy (Notable & Quotable, May 21), he warned that climate change will increase the risk of political instability and swell the number of "climate change refugees." In support of this claim, he asserted that severe drought was a significant factor both in the rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria and in the descent of Syria into civil war.
California, too, is in the midst of a nasty drought, but so far things seem pretty peaceful there. There are, of course, many reasons for that. One is that the average Californian uses about fives times more energy than the average Syrian and 40 times more than the average Nigerian. Indeed, a glance at those countries where most of the world's refugees originate shows they have one thing in common -- energy poverty. Cheap fossil-based energy isn't the problem, it's the solution.
Instead of worrying about speculative climate change refugees, maybe it's time we spared a thought for today's "energy refugees."

Full text:   Oil companies are ratcheting up their involvement in the debate over climate change as governments, activists, churches and some big investors gear up for a global summit on the issue at the end of the year in Paris.
The stated goal of the summit is to keep manmade warming limited to two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, but governments remain far apart on how to achieve it.
Meeting such a goal will require far-reaching changes in energy-consumption patterns and likely efforts to put a cost on carbon use, many experts say. Activists have long focused much of their effort on trying to rein in the use of resource companies' bread and butter: carbon-emitting fossil fuels.
Pope Francis is planning to weigh in on the environment in an encyclical -- a letter intended to develop and explain Catholic teaching -- due within the next few weeks, which has made Rome one of the focal points in the global-warming debate. Exxon Mobil Corp. recently dispatched one of its senior lobbyists and a planning executive to Rome in an attempt to brief the Vatican on its outlook for energy markets.
For years, shareholder activists have urged resource companies to curb emissions. More recently, some big investors are taking global warming into consideration in their portfolio building. The Church of England and Norway's sovereign-wealth fund, one of the world's biggest institutional investors, have sold off shares in pure-play coal companies.
At the same time, some of the resource companies' own shareholders are pushing them to scale back their dependence on carbon-based fuels, worried about the future financial impact of heightened global-warming regulation. Oil, mining and coal companies also are anticipating rules to limit emissions that would make oil and natural gas more costly, potentially reducing demand for the fuels.
This has led to a change in behavior. Where in the past executives could be dismissive of the climate-change debate or leap to defend their companies, industry officials are now raising the issue themselves and proposing remedies such as the imposition of a carbon tax.
"We have to stop being defensive," Total SA Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne told a major industry conference in Houston last month. "In the end, it won't be solved by diplomacy only, but by private players, economic players like us."
Total, Saudi Aramco, Eni SpA, BG PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and others have formed an industry group specifically to add their collective voice to the climate debate, and they are trying to bring other leading international oil-and-gas companies into the group.
"Business is engaged in a way I've never seen before," said Rachel Kyte, head of the climate-change division of the World Bank.
Similarly, the mining industry's "approach to sustainable development has evolved," said Gary Goldberg, chief executive of Newmont Mining Corp., one of the world's biggest gold-mining companies. "It still needs to be addressed globally, and you still need to come up with a global solution."
In February, Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden told a group of executives at an oil-and-gas conference in London that they could no longer keep a "low profile on the issue" of climate change ahead of United Nations-sponsored talks in Paris this year that could result in new global carbon-emissions limits.
The Vatican is another important constituency. In an unusually explicit mix of the political and pastoral, Pope Francis has said he wants his encyclical about the environment to come out before the Paris climate meeting, so that it can "make a contribution" to deliberations.
"The minute the word got out that the pope was working on this, we had a lot of people contributing," said Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, who heads the Vatican office in charge of drafting the encyclical. "We listened to everybody who had something to say: physicians, academicians, students; people in all walks of life, including people from the oil industry."
The Exxon briefing took place over a small private lunch at the home of a U.S. diplomat in the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See. A second Exxon lobbyist who is based in Italy attended the meeting, Exxon said.
The meeting also was attended by Curtis McKenzie, a Canadian national with experience in finance and the oil-and-gas industry. Mr. McKenzie has had several duties in Cardinal Turkson's office, including administrative and research tasks and media relations, all on a voluntary basis.
Vatican officials weren't present, Mr. McKenzie said. He said he isn't directly involved in work related to the encyclical.
The encyclical pointedly wasn't discussed at the meeting, Exxon and Mr. McKenzie said. The Exxon planning official gave a 16-slide PowerPoint presentation covering the company's broad outlook for the global industry and energy use -- a talk Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said its executives have delivered hundreds of times this year.
Exxon said that interacting with the Vatican isn't unusual for the company. "Exxon Mobil has a long-standing relationship with the Vatican and our people have had numerous interactions with Vatican officials over the years," Mr. Jeffers said in an emailed comment.

Full text:   THE HAGUE -- Royal Dutch Shell PLC's chief executive on Tuesday defended the company's environmental record as its board was peppered with questions about plans for Arctic exploration and the risks climate change poses to its business.
In the company's first annual shareholder meeting since it announced its planned tie-up with British energy company BG Group, the climate issue took center stage, overshadowing the $70 billion deal announced in April. It took place after Shell's Arctic-bound vessels were met with kayak-borne protests in Seattle last week. Fossil-fuel companies are coming under scrutiny ahead of climate-change talks in Paris later this year.
CEO Ben van Beurden said the company was the first in the industry to acknowledge a link between carbon-dioxide emissions and climate change.
"We have thought through a fairly pragmatic strategy to position your company with the long-term energy transition that is currently under way," Mr. van Beurden said.
On the Arctic, Mr. van Beurden said Shell was managing the risks of Arctic drilling "down to the levels that we think are acceptable and indeed negligible."
Mr. van Beurden is the latest oil-industry executive to face questions over the environment.
Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson told the Associated Press last month that world energy demand requires fossil-fuel companies to keep looking for new resources, or "everybody's lights would be going off before not too long." BP PLC Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg told investors last month that "fossil fuels will be part of a balanced, sustainable energy mix for many decades to come."
The investor concerns highlight the challenges Shell faces as it seeks to position itself as a greener, gas-focused energy company. Its tie-up with BG would give it a dominant position in liquefied natural gas, which is cleaner-burning than oil.
But Shell is also doing some of the most environmentally sensitive drilling work in the world, from Canadian tar sands to the Nigerian Delta. At the heart of that tension sits the company's controversial plans to drill for oil in the Arctic this summer.
Shell's annual gathering was heralded by a flurry of news releases sent out by environmental groups protesting the company's Arctic drilling plans.
"There's a complete disconnect between Shell's words and actions on climate change," said Louise Rouse, a consultant for Greenpeace, the environmental group, and a Shell shareholder. "It's as if a transition to a low-carbon economy can be accommodated to oil companies. Climate change isn't going to wait for oil companies to be ready."
Shell's previous experience in the Arctic in 2012 was plagued with missteps. After paying more than $2 billion to the federal government to obtain Arctic licenses, Shell had to stop drilling early because of sea ice. On its way back to port, one of the company's rigs ran aground, resulting in U.S. government fines for Clean Air Act violations.
Shell still requires a number of legal permits to get the final green light to resume exploration in the Arctic, but this time the company insists it has taken adequate precautions, upgraded its fleet and rigorously tested its oil-spill response mechanisms.
The scrutiny comes as activists, government officials and business leaders focus on the issue of climate change ahead of a United Nations conference on carbon emissions in Paris this year.

Full text:   Global sea levels are rising faster than previously thought, though seawaters haven't climbed as high as scientists estimated, according to a new study.
The research, published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, helps resolve an enigma related to an earlier study that indicated the rate of the sea-level rise had slowed, despite the greater quantity of water entering the oceans from melting in Greenland and West Antarctica over the past decade.
The new measurements, which used relatively new satellite technology, suggest a small acceleration in the rate of the sea-level rise in the most recent decade compared with the previous one.
"The acceleration is particularly striking because it is exactly in line with what we expect" from commonly accepted projections of sea-level change, said Christopher Watson of the University of Tasmania and lead author of the study.
Sea levels were more or less static in recent millennia. But there has been a significant rise in the 20th century, which is widely accepted to be one of the most pronounced effects of climate change. Scientists warn that if the planet continues to warm and seas continue to rise, low-lying islands and coastal areas would be especially vulnerable to floods, storms and surges.
The previous study suggested that the average global sea level rose by about 3.2 millimeters a year since 1993. It also concluded that the rise was slower in the second half of that period than the first. But other data showed more water was entering the oceans from increased polar melting.
Trying to resolve the contradiction, Dr. Watson and his colleagues used sea-level data from three joint satellite missions launched by the French space agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. They combined that with data from a network of tide gauges measuring water levels.
The researchers used satellites to get measurements of the land movement, which gave them a better fix on local sea-level measurements as obtained by tide gauges. They also accounted for a slight discrepancy in the satellite measurements related to the electronics.
The revised estimates showed that the average global sea level had increased by 2.6-2.9 millimeters a year between 1993 and 2014 -- less than the previous estimates. But they also showed the level rising fastest in the last 10 years.
The findings are consistent with the projections of future sea-level rise estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body, which represents a consensus estimate among scientists.

Governor Orders
40% Emissions Cut
California is set to develop North America's most stringent greenhouse-gas-reduction standards over the next 15 years under an executive order signed on Wednesday by Gov. Jerry Brown.
The Democrat ordered that by 2030, greenhouse-gas emissions need to fall 40% from 1990 levels. The targets align the largest U.S. state with standards set by the European Union and come ahead of a global climate summit in Paris later this year.
The goals won praise from dignitaries including World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Mr. Brown has aimed to make climate change a signature issue of his administration, while also dealing with an extreme drought.
Business leaders cautioned of the order's potential economic impact. "As California continues its leadership role in addressing climate change, costs on business and impacts on jobs and competitiveness cannot be ignored," said Allan Zaremberg of the California Chamber of Commerce.

BOSTON BOMBING
Witnesses: Tsarnaev
Was Good-Natured
Defense lawyers called former teachers and friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's to the stand Wednesday to testify that the Boston Marathon bomber was good-natured, determined and well-liked before his family life unraveled.
Jurors saw photos of Mr. Tsarnaev on field trips, getting a soccer trophy and holding the newborn baby of a favorite teacher. Public-school teachers from Cambridge, Mass., described their former student in glowing terms: a standout scholar and athlete who appeared to have a promising future.
Mr. Tsarnaev was convicted this month in the deadly April 2013 attack. The same jury is now weighing whether to sentence him to death or life in prison without parole. The prosecution has cited his character as one of the reasons why the death penalty is appropriate. They have called him callous and indifferent to human life.

EDUCATION
Grants of $3 Million
To Aid Tribal Youth
In a bid to improve substandard schooling options for Native Americans, federal officials are giving out $3 million in grants for tribal communities to develop local programs, the Education Department said Wednesday.
The project, which targets college and career readiness, is part of a wider effort by the White House to help young Native Americans. About 74% of American Indian and Alaskan Natives ages 18 to 24 had at least a high-school diploma in 2011, compared with the national average of 84%.
"We are really excited to see this. . . . The $3 million is not a lot, but it's a great first step to make," said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the nonprofit National Indian Education Association.

Abstract: Regarding William McGurn's "The Pope, the Poor and Climate Change" (Main Street, April 21): In a country like India, around 350 million people (more than the population of the U.S.) go to bed early because there is no electric light, often miss meals because there is no food, and huddle together in huts because there is no heat.

Full text:   Regarding William McGurn's "The Pope, the Poor and Climate Change" (Main Street, April 21): In a country like India, around 350 million people (more than the population of the U.S.) go to bed early because there is no electric light, often miss meals because there is no food, and huddle together in huts because there is no heat. What they need desperately now and not in the future is energy, and in the cheapest form available, which happens to be coal.
When the greens, and now possibly the pope, preach about the effect of climate change on future generations, which future generations are they talking about? In many poor countries much of those future generations may not be around because the earlier ones died because of a lack of energy. One has to wonder who holds the moral high ground here.

Mr. McGurn doesn't define "God's bounty." It includes clean, healthful air, clean water, fertile soils and rich biodiversity. Mr. McGurn would agree with much of today's environmentalism. During the time referenced in Genesis, money wasn't created, nor would profit or private ownership be considerations.
Will our Judeo-Christian concept of a human-centered world change? We should all be more humble and recall Ambrose Bierce's ironic definition of an ocean: "A body of water occupying about two-thirds of a world made for man -- who has no gills."

Full text:   When Pope Francis visits Washington later this year, the man who will host him at the White House expects a meeting of the minds on at least one topic: climate change.
President Barack Obama, in a Wall Street Journal interview on Monday, called the pope "an extraordinary individual, a transformative leader, not just within the Catholic Church, but globally."
Asked to anticipate the agenda when he meets the pope in September, Mr. Obama noted that in a previous conversation they talked about global poverty, and said he expects a continuation of that conversation.
Then he added: "We're going to talk about climate change, I'm sure, because he is very clear that part of the Church's teachings, and part of my faith, is that we have to be good stewards of this incredible planet we've been given, and there are steps that can be taken there."
Pope Francis also is going to stop in Cuba on his way to the U.S., the Vatican has announced. He played an important behind-the-scenes role in brokering the agreement a few months ago under which the Obama administration resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba after decades of estrangement.
Mr. Obama gave no indication, though, that he has any plans to follow the pope's lead by visiting Cuba while still in office.
"I don't know if I'll get to Cuba," he said in the interview. "What I know is a lot of Americans are going to get to Cuba over the next couple of years. We're already seeing incredible interest in trading with Cuba, in investment in Cuba."
On a lighter note, Mr. Obama left no doubt about where his loyalties lie if the Washington Wizards and his hometown Chicago Bulls were to meet in this year's National Basketball Association playoffs.
"I think it's fair to say any time the Bulls are playing I'm rooting for the Bulls," he said. "Bulls all the way, that's how we roll."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama and Congress are headed for another power clash on the international stage, as key Senate Republicans challenge his efforts to forge a global pact on climate change.
The White House considers the agreement with nearly 200 nations a historic opportunity to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions world-wide. But some GOP senators view it as executive overreach, and they are quietly considering ways to warn other countries that the president doesn't speak for them and may not be able to deliver on his promises to slash emissions.
The strategy has a familiar ring. Last month, 47 Republican senators signed a letter telling Iran's leaders that the next president could revoke any nuclear agreement and that Congress could modify it at any time. Some Senate Republicans say they want to send a similar message to the countries negotiating an agreement that would rein in greenhouse-gas emissions.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said a bipartisan pact giving Congress a bigger role in reviewing a final Iran deal could serve as a precedent.
Administration officials have signaled optimism that climate talks are on track, with countries working toward completing a deal in December. They have expressed confidence that laws already on the books will allow them to move ahead with a plan submitted to the United Nations to cut greenhouse gases in the U.S. by nearly 30% by 2025 based on 2005 emission levels.
A central component of the president's climate plan is a contentious Environmental Protection Agencyproposal to cut carbon emissions from U.S. power plants that is being challenged in court. Mr. McConnell, who argues the power-plant regulations hurt the coal industry in states including his, last month warned other countries to "proceed with caution before entering into a binding, unattainable deal."
Administration officials say they are confident the EPA is on firm legal footing, adding that similar regulations have been challenged repeatedly and usually have been upheld.
"We're operating in a space where we feel comfortable that we have the authority that we need to galvanize global momentum on this issue," said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the president.
Senate Republicans, though, question the president's plan to curb carbon emissions and the impact it would have on the U.S. economy.
Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.) said Mr. Obama's unilateral pursuit of the climate accord exceeds the scope of president's power. Mr. Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, plans to hold a hearing this summer focused on the Senate's advice-and-consent process and its possible application in international climate negotiations.
Additionally, Mr. Inhofe said the Iran letter, which was penned by Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), could be a useful model to send a message about the climate agreement.
"The Tom Cotton letter was an educational effort," Mr. Inhofe said in an interview. Other countries think "if the president of the United States says something, it's just automatic. . . His letter was over there saying, 'the president says he can do this; he can't do this.'"
Mr. Obama decried as inappropriately partisan both the letter from 47 Republican senators and Mr. McConnell's warning to the world about the U.S. government's ability to fulfill a climate-change pledge.
Todd Stern, the special envoy for climate change at the State Department, said other countries have raised questions during climate negotiations about Republican opposition to Mr. Obama's plan for cutting emissions, but he said international partners can be confident that the U.S. will honor its commitment.
"Countries want to get reassurance that the U.S. can deliver on what we've said that we're doing," Mr. Stern added.

Full text:   This Wednesday we mark Earth Day. A week from now, the Vatican will add its own contribution to what Pope Francis calls "human ecology" in the form of a summit called "Protect the Earth, Dignify Humanity." The summit will in turn be followed by an encyclical some time later this year.
Many find the whole idea unsettling. They fear it means a papal imprimatur for the political and economic orthodoxies of the green movement, confusing the faithful and leading to another series of press conferences that will begin with a Vatican spokesman saying, "What the pope meant to say . . ."
The fears are not without cause. There are many signs that do not augur well, from the muddled section on economics in the pope's first encyclical to his posing for a photo while holding up an anti-fracking T-shirt, to press coverage anticipating he will be to the fight against greenhouse gases what Pope John Paul II was to the fight against Soviet communism.
Even so, the topic is ripe for precisely the kind of corrective a pope has to offer: a reminder that God's creation is meant to serve man -- not man the environment. And its corollary: It is the have-nots who pay the highest price for the statist interventions so beloved of the Church of St. Green.
The Judeo-Christian view takes its lead from Genesis 2:15: "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it." Plainly this imposes on mankind an obligation of stewardship. And yes, we can all think of people and regions that have suffered because someone exploited an area for private gain while dumping all the costs on the public.
Still, the first part of that Genesis passage means something too: that the earth is to be worked, and that this work and the fruit it bears are also blessed.
After all, what is work but the application of human ingenuity and labor to God's creation to increase God's bounty? For Genesis also tells us we are fashioned in the image and likeness of our Creator. In a sense this means we are at our most human when we use our God-given talents to participate in acts of co-creation.
How different this is from the narrative that dominates the conversation on the environment, and especially the conversation on climate change. All too often the vision of man here is as the despoiler, speeding the planet along the path to doom and destruction.
In this reading, modern technology is almost always an enemy, progress is illusory and more babies mean more carbon footprints melting the ice caps where polar bears live. Indeed, the number of environmentalists who end up embracing population control is astounding. Likewise their language, which tends to the apocalyptic -- from Paul Ehrlich calling his book "The Population Bomb" to the conservationist Paul Watson characterizing humans as "the AIDS of the earth."
When this thinking is taken to its logical conclusion, it's not Swedish or American women or their babies who find themselves targeted. It is African women and African babies, Chinese women and Chinese babies, Indian women and Indian babies, Latino women and Latino babies, and so on. Something, perhaps, for the pope to ponder next time he's in the mood to preach against noxious Western exports.
Meanwhile, encouraging a sturdier appreciation in the green movement for man's ability to use his mind to find solutions for the earth's problems would help. Take, for example, two popular targets of the environmental movement: chemicals and fossil fuels.
Those of us who get our fruit and vegetables at Whole Foods may have a hard time appreciating the scourge that insects, parasites and disease are to those in poorer parts of the world. Or the high price these people pay when they are denied these man-made tools in the name of some environmental fad.
How many African children died, for example, when the use of DDT on the continent -- arguably the most effective anti-mosquito insecticide -- declined after the U.S. banned it in 1972 on the basis of pop science? Along the same lines, when we measure the costs of fossil fuels, shouldn't we include the human costs that result when restrictions on fossil fuels would mean denying hundreds of millions of people in the developing world the life-enhancing improvements that come from cheaper energy?
In its unwillingness to consider such trade-offs, modern environmentalism at times takes on the aspects of an authoritarian religion for the wealthy, with its own Eden (earth before man ruined it); its heretics (skeptics about man's contributions to global warming are "deniers"); and its indulgences (make up for your corporate jet by driving a Prius).
All well worth not only mentioning but highlighting, especially in a papal effort that aims at putting the human back in human ecology.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals-court panel suggested Thursday that it might be too early for a court challenge to an Obama administration proposal to cut carbon emissions from U.S. power plants.
The case against the Environmental Protection Agency, up for oral argument at the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, is the first test of how well the central component of President Barack Obama's climate agenda can withstand legal scrutiny.
The rules aren't yet final, however, a development the courts almost always require before allowing challenges to a regulation.
"All we have in front of us is a proposed rule-making," said Judge Tom Griffith, who was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush.
Judge Griffith also said that a ruling on a proposed regulation could invite legal challenges on other proposed regulations. "You're inviting us into a morass," Judge Griffith said to Elbert Lin, solicitor general for West Virginia, the lead plaintiff in the case challenging the EPA.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, another Bush appointee, said the "dividing line between judicial review and waiting" is whether a regulation is final.
Still, the judges also suggested it might be fine for them to rule now since the proposed regulation isn't likely to change significantly when it does become final.
"What are we do to with statements that say the rule won't be changed," Judge Griffith said, referring to remarks made by EPA officials.
Proposed in June 2014, the regulations call for a 30% cut in power-plant carbon emissions by 2030, based on emissions levels in 2005.
The state and corporate challengers argue the regulation is such a dramatic, labor-intensive overhaul that it is a threat to the U.S. coal industry.
"While we have always said that it is unusual to set aside a proposed rule, we believe that it is legally justified and appropriate in this case," West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said in a written statement after the hearing. "The EPA has made clear that it plans to finalize this rule and regulate based upon a section of the Clean Air Act where it lacks legal authority to do so."
The Obama administration says that the EPA is interpreting the Clean Air Act in a reasonable way, and more broadly, that past legal precedents, including Supreme Court rulings, give the government the authority to address climate change.
"We believe that lawsuits challenging the rule are premature," EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia said. Ms. Purchia said that the agency addressed the legal underpinning of its proposal last June and plans to address all comments about legality in the final rule, expected this summer.
The arguments lasted for more than two hours, with testimony from a group of coal-dependent states and Ohio-based coal producer Murray Energy Corp., which brought the case, and government lawyers defending the EPA.
A decision is expected in the coming months.
The challengers argued the Clean Air Act prohibits certain double regulation of existing power plants, citing an ambiguity in the law dating back more than 20 years.
The EPA already regulates mercury emissions from power plants under one section of the law, so the challengers argue the EPA can't rely upon a different, rarely used provision to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions of power plants. The rule regulating mercury emissions from power plants is under review by the Supreme Court, and a rule on that is expected by June.
During the arguments, the judges indicated legal precedent may suggest that when inconsistency in the law exists, government agencies get deference in interpreting it.
The case is the beginning of what is expected to be a yearslong legal battle over Mr. Obama's climate agenda. "We expect it will be legally challenged, and it could likely go to the Supreme Court," EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said last week.

Abstract: Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the new policy comes weeks after the Clinton Health Access Initiative, a charity affiliated with the Clinton Foundation, didn't disclose millions of dollars in donations from countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland, Norway and the U.K. "The Clinton Foundation receiving foreign government funding as Hillary Clinton campaigns to be president should set off alarm bells," Mr. Priebus said.

Full text:   The board of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation has decided to continue accepting donations from foreign governments, primarily from six countries, even though Hillary Clinton is running for president, a summary of the new policy to be released Thursday shows.
The rules would permit donations from Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the U.K. -- countries that support or have supported Clinton Foundation programs on health, poverty and climate change, according to the summary.
That means other nations would be prohibited from making large donations to the foundation. But those governments would be allowed to participate in the Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary of the foundation where companies, nonprofit groups and government officials work on solutions to global problems.
Ministers from any government would be allowed to attend meetings and appear on panels at the group's meetings and their governments would be allowed to pay attendance fees of $20,000.
The new policy, which was designed to address growing concern that the donations would present a conflict of interest for a Hillary Clinton presidency, all but ensures that Mrs. Clinton's links to the charity will be a feature of the emerging presidential campaign.
The campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, when asked about foreign contributions, Mrs. Clinton said she was "very proud of the work the foundation does" and noted that there are "hundreds of thousands of people who support the work of the foundation."
The limits are meant to strike a balance between protecting existing programs while shielding the foundation and Mrs. Clinton from charges that foreign governments are buying influence through their donations, a person familiar with the foundation's deliberations said. The foundation will begin to release donor names quarterly starting in July. Previously the names were released annually.
"By implementing this new, even stronger and more transparent policy, the Clinton Foundation is reinforcing its commitment to accountability while protecting programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around the world," said Craig Minassian, spokesman for the Clinton Foundation.
As a direct result of the restrictions, officials will stop holding events around the world, beyond an event planned for Morocco in early May, which was considered too close to cancel. That event, the Clinton Global Initiative Middle East & Africa conference in Marrakesh, has been funded in part by a $1 million gift from a Moroccan-government owned phosphate-export company, OCP. A Clinton Global Initiative-Mediterranean meeting focused on the economy and scheduled for June in Athens is being canceled.
The six countries on the approved donor list are less controversial and politically sensitive than some who gave in 2014, such as Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Still, even the allowed countries would pose issues for a Hillary Clinton administration. Canada's Foreign Department has made Clinton Foundation donations and is also leading the charge to win approval for the Keystone XL pipeline. The U.S. and Germany also differ on how best to respond to Russia's aggression in Ukraine.
The foundation plan will likely renew the foreign-gift controversy just as Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign launched this week. Earlier this year, Mrs. Clinton came under fire from both Democrats and Republicans when The Wall Street Journal reported that foreign donations to the foundation had resumed last year after a virtual halt when she served as secretary of state from 2009-13.
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the new policy comes weeks after the Clinton Health Access Initiative, a charity affiliated with the Clinton Foundation, didn't disclose millions of dollars in donations from countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland, Norway and the U.K. "The Clinton Foundation receiving foreign government funding as Hillary Clinton campaigns to be president should set off alarm bells," Mr. Priebus said. "The fact that the Clinton Foundation previously failed to disclose foreign government donations should cast even greater doubt on any new policy."
The new rules for the Clinton Health Access Initiative, an affiliated but separate charity, were expected to be somewhat less restrictive than the new Clinton Foundation rules, and hadn't been completed on Wednesday. Officials said the missing disclosure was an oversight.
Ethics experts had recommended the foundation forego all foreign donations. Robert Walker, the former nonpartisan chief counsel and staff director of the Senate and House ethics committees, said the foundation likely will need to go further than its current plan.
"The only effective step would be for the foundation to cease accepting donations from foreign governments," Mr. Walker said. "It is inevitable that the foundation will, sooner rather than later, decide to forego accepting donations from foreign governments, except for those pledges already on approved multiyear cycles."
Under the new rules, approved countries would be allowed to renew multiyear pledges, or make additional contributions to new programs, an official said. Such funding would support economic development or climate-focused work of the Clinton Climate Initiative, the Clinton Development Initiative, which focuses on Malawi, Rwanda and Tanzania, and the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership.
One example is a $12 million, three-year contract the Australian Department of Environment has with the Clinton Climate Initiative to create a system to monitor emissions in Kenya. The Australian pledge began in 2013 and continues until next year.
The Obama administration in 2009 wanted to avoid conflicts of interest with former President Bill Clinton raising money from foreign governments that also would be working with Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state. At the time, the Clinton Foundation agreed to stop raising new money from foreign governments, with a few exceptions for multiyear pledges for health and other initiatives.
Under the agreement with the Obama transition office, the Clinton Foundation agreed to separate the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative and to begin disclosing all donors to the foundation. The two groups won't be divided under the new policy.
The terms also spelled out that Mr. Clinton wouldn't solicit funds for CGI and wouldn't send letters seeking contributions from potential CGI sponsors. Pledges and donations from foreign governments and government-owned companies were to be presented to the State Department for review by an ethics officer.

Abstract: Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, recently caused a stir by sending letters to seven university presidents seeking background information on scientists and professors who had given congressional testimony that failed to endorse what is the conventional wisdom in some quarters regarding climate change. Though the congressman lacked legal authority to demand information, his aggressive plan, which came to light in late February, should not be a surprise at a time when power holders from the White House on down are employing similar means against perceived enemies.

Full text:   Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, recently caused a stir by sending letters to seven university presidents seeking background information on scientists and professors who had given congressional testimony that failed to endorse what is the conventional wisdom in some quarters regarding climate change. One of the targets was Steven Hayward, a colleague of mine at Pepperdine's School of Public Policy.
Though the congressman lacked legal authority to demand information, his aggressive plan, which came to light in late February, should not be a surprise at a time when power holders from the White House on down are employing similar means against perceived enemies.
Mr. Grijalva left a clue about how he operates in 2013 when the magazine In These Times asked about his legislative strategy. "I'm a Saul Alinsky guy," he said, referring to the community organizer and activist who died in 1972, "that's where I learned this stuff."
What sort of stuff? Mr. Grijalva sent his letters not to the professors but to university presidents, without (at least in the case of Mr. Hayward) the professors' knowledge. Mr. Hayward was not even employed by Pepperdine at the time of his congressional testimony in 2011.
But targeting institutions and their leaders is pure Alinsky; so are the scare tactics. Mr. Grijalva's staff sent letters asking for information about the professors, with a March 16 due date -- asking, for instance, if they had accepted funding from oil companies -- using official congressional letterhead, and followed up with calls from Mr. Grijalva's congressional office. This is a page from Alinsky's book, in both senses of the word: "Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have," reads one tip in his 1971 "Rules for Radicals."
Yet adopting Alinsky's tactics may not in this case fit with Alinsky's philosophy. This is Alinsky with a twist. Despite myriad philosophical inconsistencies, "Rules for Radicals" is meant to empower the weaker against the stronger. Alinsky writes: "The Prince was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. Rules for Radicals is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away."
In a similar vein, the political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain supported Alinsky's work in getting disengaged communities -- typically in lower socio-economic strata -- to assume the difficult responsibilities of citizenship. As a way of challenging "big government," even conservatives such as former House Majority Leader Dick Armey have recommended Alinsky's tactics (minus his professed hatred of capitalism, etc.).
But what happens when Machiavelli's Prince reads and employs "Rules for Radicals"? In 2009 President Obama's friend and adviser Valerie Jarrett was asked on CNN about media bias, particularly at Fox News, and she responded: "What the administration has said very clearly is that we're going to speak truth to power." I remember thinking: "Wait a minute, you're the White House. You are the power."
In that sense President Obama's election was both the climax of Alinsky's vision and an existential crisis for that vision. Alinsky promoted the few tactics available to the downtrodden: irreverence, ridicule and deception. "Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it," he wrote. So the rise to power of the world's most famous community organizer raises a question: Should Alinskyite tactics be employed by those in power, or should they be reserved for those without?
Mr. Grijalva's campaign against seven academics serves as a cautionary tale of what can happen when power adopts these strategies to suppress opposition. The congressman's office arranged additional pressure by notifying national and local media that these professors were under "investigation." On the day the letters went out, the Washington Post blared: "House Dems: Did Big Oil seek to sway scientists in climate debate?"
After receiving a call from a Grijalva staffer, our local Malibu Times obliged with the front-page headline, "Pepperdine Professor Investigated by Congressman." The online Delaware News Journal, the hometown newspaper for David Legates at the University of Delaware, wrote: "UD's David Legates caught in climate change controversy." Alabama's Huntsville Times had a piece under the headline: "Arizona congressman asking questions about outside funding for UAH climate expert John Christy."
To their credit, several editorial boards came to the defense of the professors. The Arizona Republic, the home-state newspaper of Mr. Grijalva and targeted Arizona State University professor Robert Balling, wrote that Mr. Grijalva's campaign "fits the classic definition of a witch hunt." Rep. Grijalva on March 2 acknowledged to National Journal that some of the information he demanded from the universities was "overreach" but defended his demand for information about funding sources.
How did it come to this? The inability of politicians to confront another's argument, much less to attempt to persuade the other side, has become standard operating procedure. Now this toxic approach is extending to the broader world of policy -- including scientific research. Instead of evaluating the quality of the research, opponents make heavy-handed insinuations about who funds it -- as though that matters if the science is sound. And now just about every climate scientist employed by an American university knows that Washington is watching.
More broadly, what has happened is that a generation of American politicians who came of age during Saul Alinsky's lifetime has moved into positions of institutional power that he so often derided as "the enemy." They are showing an inability to leave behind Alinsky's tactics that were intended for the weak against the strong. Civil discourse and academic freedom suffer while the "Prince" becomes more powerful.

Full text:   The Obama administration formally submitted its plan for cutting greenhouse gases nearly 30% by 2025, part of a global effort this year to curb emissions of carbon dioxide.
The move adds pressure on other countries -- including Australia, Canada, and India -- that haven't spelled out concrete plans.
The U.S., the second-biggest carbon emitter after China, has taken a leading role in recent months in negotiations with nearly 200 nations to strike an agreement through the United Nations to rein in gases blamed for global warming.
"Our target will help spur others to step forward with targets of their own," said Todd Stern, the U.S. special envoy for climate change.
Republicans used the announcement to amplify criticism of President Barack Obama's federal emissions rules, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warning other countries that Congress could stand in the way of promises the White House makes in the negotiations.
"Our international partners should proceed with caution before entering into a binding, unattainable deal," the Kentucky Republican said in a statement.
Major world economies had been expected to submit their contributions to carbon cuts by the end of March, but only a few have done so -- the U.S., the European Union, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland and Russia, which also made its move Tuesday.
The U.S. announcement shows the White House is trying to keep the climate talks on track as countries work toward a deal in Paris in December. Some developing countries and commodity-dependent economies are dragging their feet. But U.S. officials say Mexico's timely submission of a plan and China's announced goal are a sign that the old divide between rich and poorer countries is coming down.
The cuts that the Obama administration is offering rely on previously announced rules for power-plant emissions, vehicle efficiency and building standards. The power-plant rules, expected to be completed this summer, would reduce emissions from that sector by 30% between 2005 and 2030. The administration is planning new regulations for medium and heavy-duty vehicles by next March and has programs to boost energy conservation in buildings and curb other gases.
The American Petroleum Institute, a Washington-based trade group for the oil and gas industry, cautioned in a statement Tuesday that the administration's proposals could increase the cost of energy and crimp growth. "Meeting climate challenges must go hand in hand with ensuring that Americans have the affordable and reliable sources of energy necessary to grow our economy," the group said.
Mr. Obama had already given the size of the U.S. cut -- between 26% and 28% of carbon dioxide by 2025 from 2005 levels -- in a joint announcement with China last fall in Beijing.
Republicans in Congress call the administration's efforts to regulate power plants a "war on coal," and have criticized the joint announcement because it establishes a peak year for Chinese emissions rather than spelling out the country's reductions.
GOP lawmakers also question Mr. Obama's ability to enact power-plant rules through the Environmental Protection Agency.
The U.S. is backing a delicate balance for the legal framework of the Paris agreement; the deal is meant to have legal force in some areas but wouldn't be a formal treaty that would need support in the U.S. Senate, according to people following the negotiations.
The stated goal of the current round of negotiations is to prevent global average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, but experts following the talks say it is unlikely any deal reached in Paris this year would meet that target.
Other leading economies are expected to submit their national contributions to the cuts in the first half of this year, and officials will meet for rounds of negotiations before the high-level gathering in Paris.

Full text:   The Environmental Protection Agency has rolled out an ambitious Clean Power Plan to get states to cut their carbon emissions. And it has run up against a chorus of critics charging the agency with vast overreach.
To get an inside look at the fight, Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Gerard Baker spoke with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. Here are edited excerpts of their conversation.
MR. BAKER: Your Clean Power Plan is the topic on everybody's lips. It's run into some legal challenges. Is this constitutional overreach on your part?
MS. MCCARTHY: We're doing an extraordinary job making this the best, cooperative proposal EPA has ever put out. I am confident that we are not violating the Constitution. I feel confident we are going to get this rule over the finish line in a way that's reasonable, appropriate and necessary in terms of actions we need to take on climate.
MR. BAKER: It is a pretty remarkable, constitutional move, isn't it, for the EPA? Remaking the American power sector by federal instruction to the states to make these changes, without a congressional mandate.
MS. MCCARTHY: I am following the direction of the Supreme Court, that they've given me three times, to say that carbon has to be addressed as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.
This is a rule that is regulating carbon pollution from the largest source of carbon pollution in this country. It is being done consistent with exactly what the statute tells us we're supposed to do. And we are doing it in the way that brings the most flexibility to the states so that they can understand what direction they want to take.
We are not saying that they need to get a 30% reduction by 2030. We are saying that each state needs to start where they are today, look at what's reasonable to achieve, and then they need to work with us to develop their plans for how to get there in 2030. The accumulation of those state plans result in 30% reduction.
MR. BAKER: Mitch McConnell has called on states to not cooperate with the mandate. A lot of Republican states seem to be perhaps inclined to do that. Where does that leave it?
MS. MCCARTHY: I think states are much better off crafting their own plans.
MR. BAKER: But if they don't, what are you going to do?
MS. MCCARTHY: We're going to initiate a federal plan.
Here's the situation. We have done outreach on this rule that has been enormously respectful of the states. I am seeing states staying at the table, rolling up their sleeves, recognizing that we presented them with an opportunity. They can create their own path moving forward.
I am not seeing them run into the night. I have every respect for states. They know how to do this, and they know that we're going to make it reasonable.
MR. BAKER: This is part of the broader Climate Change Initiative, the deal announced between the president and the Chinese government in November.
One of the criticisms is that, as significant as this may seem in the United States, in the global context, it's pretty meaningless. When you look at China and India, these are small, symbolic gestures, and they aren't going to make a big difference to how our climate change is.
MS. MCCARTHY: I couldn't disagree more. The reason why the president was able to sit down and do the joint announcement with China was because of the seriousness of domestic action. What China did was really an unprecedented commitment.
MR. BAKER: If you look at what's happening to Chinese growth and to the energy composition of Chinese growth, they were going to do that anyway. Does that represent a commitment?
MS. MCCARTHY: I've said that about the states. I've said, "You know, what we're asking you to do in the Clean Power Plan is what you'd be doing anyway if you were smart economically." So you made my case.
MR. BAKER: You can't claim that the Chinese are making a big, bold move and a dramatic concession and then acknowledge that, well, it was going to happen anyway.
MS. MCCARTHY: They finally understood that the environment and climate change have to be part and parcel of how you grow a country and its economy. One of the reasons I think China could make the transition they're making to increase renewables and cap emissions is because of all the challenges they're having on air pollution.
They have to address it anyway. Why wouldn't you address it with investments in renewables? Investment in energy efficiency? Looking at low-carbon solutions right out of the gate? That was the choice China made with the joint announcement.

Full text:   Tim Phillips heads up Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers that has become one of the biggest conservative forces in the country, fighting Democrats on issues ranging from the Affordable Care Act to climate change to the Keystone XL Pipeline.
Mr. Phillips sat down with The Wall Street Journal's Amy Harder to discuss his views on climate change, renewable energy and the Environmental Protection Agency's new rules limiting power-plant emissions. Here are edited excerpts.
MS. HARDER: You recently had dinner with a former top Obama administration official, David Axelrod. David does a lot of work on climate change. What do you think about that, Tim? Do you think the government has a responsibility to do something on climate change?
MR. PHILLIPS: I think the government has a responsibility to maintain a good, clean environment for the nation. And I think we have some of the better environmental standards in the world. And certainly, if you go to China, you don't want to see what's happening in Beijing and other places where people are struggling happen here. So we absolutely agree that we need some good, sound environmental laws. The question is, what policies do they want to do? And what impact are they going have on individual Americans? That's where we often disagree.
MS. HARDER: On climate change specifically, though, yes or no? Do you think the government should do something on that?
Mr. PHILLIPS: I think the government should look very carefully as to what level mankind is contributing to climate change. And they ought to be very careful that they don't harm a lot of Americans in our nation in pursuing policies to combat what they view as climate change or global warming.
MS. HARDER: I understand that AFP is thinking about getting involved or might be already involved in helping the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican from the very coal-intensive state of Kentucky, try to stop the EPA's proposed carbon rules. Can you talk about that?
MR. PHILLIPS: We applaud what Majority Leader McConnell is doing. We think these EPA regulations are going to harm so many Americans. An estimated 240,000 folks are going to lose their jobs, either directly or indirectly, because of new EPA power-plant rules. It's estimated that 40 states are going to see double-digit utility increases, with 14 states seeing 20%-plus utility rate increases.
MS. HARDER: The EPA itself said about 7% to 8%.
MR. PHILLIPS: We think they're lowballing it. And when you look at what those utility-rate increases mean -- maybe it isn't going to harm those of us in this room that much -- but there are millions of Americans who are struggling from paycheck to paycheck. And an increase of even 7% to 8%, and certainly 14% to 20%, is devastating.
And I think we ought to look very carefully at exactly any benefit that's going to accrue from these regulations.
MS. HARDER: If you could pick the top policy that you would want Congress to pass on energy, what would it be?
MR. PHILLIPS: Getting rid of all subsidies for every form of energy -- oil, natural gas, wind, solar, everything. Let's get government out of the business of picking winners and losers in the marketplace.
In the end, you'll get a better energy product for Americans. But you'll also lessen the cronyism that we too often see coming out of Congress, whether it's Solyndra, where the money you get, frankly, is based on how good your lobbyist is and how well-connected to some member of an administration he or she is. And by the way, Republicans have done that, too. They have absolutely been guilty of that kind of cronyism. One example is the farm bill.
The second policy would be pushing back against the RPSs [renewable portfolio standards that require increased production of energy from renewables] at the state level, especially. They distort the market and hurt individual Americans.
MS. HARDER: Generally speaking, do you support renewable energy?
MR. PHILLIPS: We think that if an energy source can compete in the marketplace, good for them, whether it's wind, solar, oil, natural gas or coal. So we have no issue at all with renewable energy, and I hope they do succeed.
[What we're doing is] working to roll back carve-outs. When you're guaranteed market share, it slows down innovation. It distorts the individual interest for corporations and individuals and companies. And this may be a contrarian view, but I think these things that have guaranteed market share to renewable have hurt them. Maybe it's helped them in the near term to lock in the ability to use subsidies and these market-share commitments to build up infrastructure, but it has harmed their innovation.
CHRIS STANLEY: I'm with Abengoa. We produce both solar and biofuels. I know Koch Industries is actually one of the largest ethanol producers in the country, so we all have that in common. Given the fact that the gasoline and petroleum market in particular isn't a free and open market, controlled from production and drilling to distribution and retail sales by basically the same companies, how do you incentivize the development of an industry like biofuels without things like [renewable fuel standards]?
MR. PHILLIPS: We would argue it's better to let the market drive it. And you're right, Koch Industries is involved in ethanol, yet we still strongly urge the ending of government standards for that, for them. The unintended consequences of that policy are a great deal of farmland being shifted from food production to energy production for biofuels that most of the studies indicate don't burn as cleanly as what we have in the first place.
Biofuels is one area where we may have some agreement with environmental groups.

Abstract: Students are directed to first recruit "trusted allies and informants" (including liberal faculty, students and alumni) and then are given a step-by-step guide on hounding universities and targeted professors with demands for records disclosure and with Freedom of Information Act requests. Art Hall, who runs the Center for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas School of Business, was forced last year to file a lawsuit to try to stop a state records request from student activists demanding his private email correspondence for the past 10 years.

Full text:   Conservative thought on campus these days is rare, though for some it's still not rare enough. Witness the growing campaign by politicians, unions and environmentalists to intimidate into silence any academic or program that might challenge liberal ideology.
Congressional Democrats have grabbed most of the attention here, with their recent attempt to cow climate skeptics. Richard Lindzen, an emeritus professor of meteorology at MIT and a Cato Institute scholar, earlier this month described in these pages how House Rep. Raul Grijalva was targeting seven academics skeptical of President Obama's climate policies, demanding documents about their funding and connections. A trio of Senate Democrats is working to muzzle more than 100 nonprofits and companies that have questioned the climate agenda, with a fishing expedition into their correspondence.
Largely unnoticed is that the congressional climate crusaders didn't come up with this idea on their own. For several years a coalition of liberal organizations have been using "disclosure" to sully the names of conservative professors and try to shut down their programs. Their particular targets are academics who benefit from funding from the Koch Foundation, which has for decades funded free-market professors and groups on U.S. campuses.
Giving money to universities, and earmarking it for certain purposes, is common, though the left has largely cornered the market. Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer and his wife several years ago pledged $40 million to Stanford to start the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy. The Morningside Foundation, established by the family of the late T.H. Chan, last year gave Harvard $350 million to fund work on, among other things, gun violence and tobacco use. The Helmsley Charitable Trust has given money to several schools to advance Common Core.
Apparently the only kind of thought not allowed is that which might "undermine," according to UnKochMyCampus, "environmental protection, worker's rights, health care expansion, and quality public education." Stopping such research is the mission of this organization, which is spearheaded by Greenpeace, Forecast the Facts (a green outfit focused on climate change), and the American Federation of Teachers.
The group's website directs student activists to a list of universities to which Koch foundations have given money, and provides a "campus organization guide" with instructions for how to "expose and undermine" any college thought that works against "progressive values." Students are directed to first recruit "trusted allies and informants" (including liberal faculty, students and alumni) and then are given a step-by-step guide on hounding universities and targeted professors with demands for records disclosure and with Freedom of Information Act requests. The AFT and the National Education Association devoted nearly a full day at a conference this month to training students on the "necessary skills to investigate and expose" any "influence" the Kochs have at universities.
This week Michigan State University released documents to student activists who had targeted political-theory professor Ross Emmett, director of the Michigan Center for Innovation and Economic Prosperity. His crime? Using Koch grant money to fund a reading group, called the Koch Scholars, that brings together students to discuss competing political economy ideas. The first two weeks were devoted to Marx, though the activists apparently couldn't tolerate an equal discussion of capitalism.
Art Hall, who runs the Center for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas School of Business, was forced last year to file a lawsuit to try to stop a state records request from student activists demanding his private email correspondence for the past 10 years. Mr. Hall's sins? His center got a seed grant from the Fred and Mary Koch Foundation, and he testified against green energy quotas at the state legislature last year.
As for those defenders of academic freedom and integrity, the American Association of University Professors several years ago defended climate scientist Michael Mann against a conservative group's demands for his records. Now the Kansas chapter of AAUP helped fund the students' demand for Mr. Hall's records.
These UnKoch tactics are spreading. In February, Right to Know, a California nonprofit opposed to genetically modified food, filed freedom of information requests at four universities, demanding correspondence between a dozen academics and outside agriculture companies and trade organizations. The Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, a left-leaning organization, recently forced the University of Louisville to release information about the founding of a new Free Enterprise Center, partly funded by Koch money.
Congressional Democrats are simply getting in on the game, using the power of government inquiry to up the ante. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin ran a campaign in 2013 against the free-market American Legislative Exchange Council, demanding information from its donors, trying to embarrass them out of funding ALEC. It worked.
Disclosure is becoming the left's new weapon. And it's shutting down debate across the country.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's initiatives to reduce air pollution have fared well in several hard-fought legal battles, but a new round of court challenges could determine whether the White House's most ambitious efforts will survive.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear argument on the Environmental Protection Agency's first-ever regulations requiring power plants to cut emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants. The rules, adopted in 2012 and scheduled to go into effect in April, were more than two decades in the making. The case could set important precedent on when and whether the agency needs to consider the potential regulatory costs to industries.
Then, in April, a U.S. appeals court will consider an early challenge to the EPA's proposal to slash carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, even though the agency hasn't finished the regulations. The coming rules, which the EPA expects to complete this summer, are the center pillar of President Barack Obama's plan to address climate change. The timing of the lawsuit is unorthodox and it faces an uphill battle, but a dozen states have lined up to try to short-circuit the EPA's plans.
Together, the lawsuits represent attacks on two of the most consequential policies of Mr. Obama's environmental agenda.
"The courts absolutely hold the key to President Obama's environmental legacy," said Thomas Lorenzen of Dorsey & Whitney LLP, a former Justice Department lawyer who supervised environmental cases.
The Supreme Court case focuses on whether the EPA acted properly when it considered only public-health risks, and not industry compliance costs, in deciding whether to require coal and oil-fired plants to cut most emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants.
Coal and oil-fired power plants are the dominant U.S. emitters of mercury, which can cause serious health problems for children as well as fetuses that can absorb the neurotoxin through their mothers. The regulations require plants to install high-tech scrubber systems to remove the pollutants.
The EPA concluded that costs weren't a relevant consideration. It conducted an analysis estimating the costs to be $9.6 billion annually while valuing the public-health improvements between $37 billion and $90 billion, mostly through a reduction in premature deaths. The EPA reached those numbers by measuring "co-benefits" of the emission controls, which will filter other pollutants in addition to mercury and related toxics.
A group of 21 states, including ones that rely heavily on coal for electricity, and industry groups challenged EPA's approach. The states in a court brief argued Congress "did not intend for EPA to act with deliberate indifference to cost when answering the basic regulatory question whether it is appropriate to regulate." The states said the health benefits of the regulations, when focused specifically on mercury reductions, were just $4 million to $6 million a year.
An EPA spokeswoman said, "We fully believe that EPA acted properly under its Clean Air Act authority in regulating harmful toxic air pollution from power plants."
If the Supreme Court rules against the EPA, the decision wouldn't foreclose the agency from regulating mercury, but it would have to write new rules and give industry costs greater consideration.
Carol Browner, a former EPA administrator under President Bill Clinton, said the case could have a broad impact if it forces the EPA to consider the costs of regulating even when the law doesn't specifically require it. "To the degree that EPA cannot maintain that distinction between the scientific process and the regulatory process, that would be a big change," said Ms. Browner, who was also a top White House adviser to Mr. Obama.
The mercury regulations also are a factor in a closely watched carbon emissions case in front of a Washington federal appeals court on April 16.
A group of states led by West Virginia, along with Ohio-based Murray Energy Corp., say the Clean Air Act prohibits certain double regulation of existing power plants. Once the EPA regulated the plants for mercury emissions under one section of the law, it couldn't then rely upon a different, rarely used provision to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, the challengers argue.
The EPA carbon regulations, proposed last June, call for a 30% cut in power-plant carbon emissions by 2030 based on emissions levels in 2005. Though the rules won't be completed for several more months, the challengers argue the regulations are such a dramatic, labor-intensive overhaul, they should be stopped now.
A Murray Energy spokesman said the company filed suit now because the plan "has caused, and continues to cause, immediate and substantial harm to the U.S. coal industry."
West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said, "Judicial relief is essential now because the mere existence and breadth of the proposal is making states and power plants expend resources and make capital investment decisions now to comply with an illegal rule."
Legal observers say the EPA's carbon proposal raises tough legal questions, but it may be too soon for a court to resolve them. "It's a real uphill battle to get a court to weigh in before an agency actually issues a final rule," said Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA official under President George W. Bush.
The EPA called the lawsuit premature and said it would address public comments about the legality of its carbon rule when it issues it. "Courts have reaffirmed repeatedly the science, law and reasoning on which our rule making has relied," the spokeswoman said.

Full text:   The Amazon rain forest has long absorbed more carbon than it releases and acted as a vital brake on climate change. An extensive study now suggests that it is losing its ability to suck up the excess carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere by human activities.
The main reason: the large-scale death of trees in the rain forest, according to the study.
Mortality rates of trees in the region have increased by more than a third since the mid-1980s. As a result, the amount of new carbon stored each year -- in the form of growing tree stems, new leaves, roots and organic matter in the soil -- is diminishing, the study says.
Carbon dioxide is necessary for photosynthesis, the complex process by which plants convert light into energy.
Carbon sinks such as the Amazon "have been a big subsidy from nature for a long time now, because they take up a significant amount of our carbon-dioxide emissions. This is a first indication that the process is saturating" as trees die off, said Oliver Phillips, professor of tropical ecology at the University of Leeds in England and a co-author of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature.
Each year, human activity releases about 35 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. For the past few decades, about a quarter of those emissions have been absorbed by the oceans, while another quarter is taken up by trees and other terrestrial sources. The other half stays in the atmosphere and is believed by many scientists to be the main driver of man-made climate change.
While increasing CO2 emissions fueled a growth spurt for the Amazon's trees, that growth rate of new trees has leveled off since 2000. At the same time, the trees' death rate has gone up.
The exact reasons for the death rate haven't been pinned down, but several factors may be at play. The Amazon climate is now more variable. Intense droughts in 2005 and 2010 killed millions of trees. Paradoxically, the availability of extra CO2 over the long term has had unexpected consequences, according to the study.
"The whole life cycle of the trees has been sped up," said Prof. Phillips. "They are growing faster, maturing faster, aging faster and dying faster."
The study has limitations. It only relates to primary, undisturbed forest, which makes up about 80% of the Amazon. Thus, it doesn't account for changes in carbon uptake in the remaining areas, as a result of agriculture, forest regrowth or deforestation.
Nor is it clear whether the reduced carbon uptake in the Amazon is also occurring in other tropical forests or, indeed, whether it will ever occur in temperate or boreal forests.
Lars Hedin, a professor of ecology at Princeton University and who wasn't involved in the research but wrote a commentary on the study, suggests that the latest analysis provides a good springboard for assessing planet-wide changes.

Full text:   Richard Lindzen describes accurately how critics of human-caused climate change are attacked personally while their substantive arguments are not answered ("The Political Assault on Climate Skeptics," op-ed, March 5). It remains to be noted that this sort of thing is far from unique. What President Dwight Eisenhower warned against has come to pass: "In holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite."
The mainstream consensus controls funding and publication and "peer review" excludes competent minority views on a wide range of topics. On matters like "global warming" that involve public policies and significant public expenditures, the attacks on those who disagree are particularly vicious.

"As with any cult," Dr. Lindzen said, "once the mythology of the cult begins falling apart, instead of saying, oh, we were wrong, they get more and more fanatical. I think that's what's happening here . . . now you're told that you get absolution if you watch your carbon footprint. It's salvation."

Full text:   I was hoping that Cheryl Achterberg's case that "Government Food Cops Are Out to Lunch" (op-ed, Feb. 27) would include the revelation that this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee factored global climate change into its food recommendations. Ms. Achterberg points out that the DGAC's updated guidelines are decoupled from the reality of American family life and eating habits and therefore are largely ignored. She suggests that the government dietary advisers stop demonizing "bad" foods, consider the experience of how people really eat, provide sensible advice and teach ways to soften the harmful effects of tasty but less healthy foods.
Those of us who are more inclined than ever to distrust federal do-gooders with hidden agendas are less likely than ever to pay attention to nutrition guidelines that now incorporate climate-change considerations. Environmental and animal-rights groups realize that people care more about their personal health than about greenhouse-gas emissions and cattle-raising practices, so they found a way to link their agendas to healthier diets. The DGAC justified its tilt this year toward plant-based foods and away from animal-based foods as one that "is more health promoting and is associated with lesser environmental impact."
According to the DGAC, planet sustainability and personal nutrition are mutually reinforcing. If we all eat less meat, we and the world will be in better shape. But can we trust a coalition of environmental, animal-rights and healthy-lifestyle advocates to plan a diet that optimizes our food preferences and nutrition, regardless of cattle-belching effects and water usage? Ms. Achterberg observes that government nutrition guidelines have been around for 35 years and their influence on American eating habits has been negligible. Adding climate-change and animal-rights considerations to the nutrition mix is a recipe for less than negligible credibility and influence.

Ms. Achterberg's piece reminds me of a brief stop I made in Ely, Nev., for lunch at a McDonald's. The place was packed with high-school students during their lunch period. "Don't they serve food at school?," I asked. The response was: "Ever since they started that new 'healthy menu,' the food's not edible."

Full text:   Research in recent years has encouraged those of us who question the popular alarm over allegedly man-made global warming. Actually, the move from "global warming" to "climate change" indicated the silliness of this issue. The climate has been changing since the Earth was formed. This normal course is now taken to be evidence of doom.
Individuals and organizations highly vested in disaster scenarios have relentlessly attacked scientists and others who do not share their beliefs. The attacks have taken a threatening turn.
As to the science itself, it's worth noting that all predictions of warming since the onset of the last warming episode of 1978-98 -- which is the only period that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) attempts to attribute to carbon-dioxide emissions -- have greatly exceeded what has been observed. These observations support a much reduced and essentially harmless climate response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.
In addition, there is experimental support for the increased importance of variations in solar radiation on climate and a renewed awareness of the importance of natural unforced climate variability that is largely absent in current climate models. There also is observational evidence from several independent studies that the so-called "water vapor feedback," essential to amplifying the relatively weak impact of carbon dioxide alone on Earth temperatures, is canceled by cloud processes.
There are also claims that extreme weather -- hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, you name it -- may be due to global warming. The data show no increase in the number or intensity of such events. The IPCC itself acknowledges the lack of any evident relation between extreme weather and climate, though allowing that with sufficient effort some relation might be uncovered.
World leaders proclaim that climate change is our greatest problem, demonizing carbon dioxide. Yet atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide have been vastly higher through most of Earth's history. Climates both warmer and colder than the present have coexisted with these higher levels.
Currently elevated levels of carbon dioxide have contributed to increases in agricultural productivity. Indeed, climatologists before the recent global warming hysteria referred to warm periods as "climate optima." Yet world leaders are embarking on costly policies that have no capacity to replace fossil fuels but enrich crony capitalists at public expense, increasing costs for all, and restricting access to energy to the world's poorest populations that still lack access to electricity's immense benefits.
Billions of dollars have been poured into studies supporting climate alarm, and trillions of dollars have been involved in overthrowing the energy economy. So it is unsurprising that great efforts have been made to ramp up hysteria, even as the case for climate alarm is disintegrating.
The latest example began with an article published in the New York Times on Feb. 22 about Willie Soon, a scientist at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Mr. Soon has, for over 25 years, argued for a primary role of solar variability on climate. But as Greenpeace noted in 2011, Mr. Soon was, in small measure, supported by fossil-fuel companies over a period of 10 years.
The Times reintroduced this old material as news, arguing that Mr. Soon had failed to list this support in a recent paper in Science Bulletin of which he was one of four authors. Two days later Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, used the Times article as the basis for a hunting expedition into anything said, written and communicated by seven individuals -- David Legates, John Christy, Judith Curry, Robert Balling, Roger Pielke Jr., Steven Hayward and me -- about testimony we gave to Congress or other governmental bodies. We were selected solely on the basis of our objections to alarmist claims about the climate.
In letters he sent to the presidents of the universities employing us (although I have been retired from MIT since 2013), Mr. Grijalva wanted all details of all of our outside funding, and communications about this funding, including "consulting fees, promotional considerations, speaking fees, honoraria, travel expenses, salary, compensation and any other monies." Mr. Grijalva acknowledged the absence of any evidence but purportedly wanted to know if accusations made against Mr. Soon about alleged conflicts of interest or failure to disclose his funding sources in science journals might not also apply to us.
Perhaps the most bizarre letter concerned the University of Colorado's Mr. Pielke. His specialty is science policy, not science per se, and he supports reductions in carbon emissions but finds no basis for associating extreme weather with climate. Mr. Grijalva's complaint is that Mr. Pielke, in agreeing with the IPCC on extreme weather and climate, contradicts the assertions of John Holdren, President Obama's science czar.
Mr. Grijalva's letters convey an unstated but perfectly clear threat: Research disputing alarm over the climate should cease lest universities that employ such individuals incur massive inconvenience and expense -- and scientists holding such views should not offer testimony to Congress. After the Times article, Sens. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) and Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) also sent letters to numerous energy companies, industrial organizations and, strangely, many right-of-center think tanks (including the Cato Institute, with which I have an association) to unearth their alleged influence peddling.
The American Meteorological Society responded with appropriate indignation at the singling out of scientists for their scientific positions, as did many individual scientists. On Monday, apparently reacting to criticism, Mr. Grijalva conceded to the National Journal that his requests for communications between the seven of us and our outside funders was "overreach."
Where all this will lead is still hard to tell. At least Mr. Grijalva's letters should help clarify for many the essentially political nature of the alarms over the climate, and the damage it is doing to science, the environment and the well-being of the world's poorest.

Full text:   U.S. dietary guidelines, the government's benchmark for balanced nutrition, have long advised Americans to eat dark, leafy greens. Now, there is another way the standards could be going green.
A panel of nutrition experts recruited by the Obama administration to help craft the next set of guidelines, to be issued this year, said in long-awaited recommendations Thursday that the government should consider the environment when deciding what people should eat.
The panel, in a departure from a decades-old recommendation, also said dietary cholesterol was no longer a big concern: It scrapped guidance that Americans limit their cholesterol intake to no more than 300 milligrams a day -- less than that found in a couple of eggs.
The panel said consuming three to five cups of coffee a day can reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It endorsed the idea that moderate amounts of alcohol were beneficial for some people.
Generally speaking, the environmental focus means endorsing a diet that includes limited amounts of meat and more plant-based foods, while also encouraging the consumption of seafood whose stocks aren't threatened.
"Addressing this complete challenge is essential to ensure a healthy food supply will be available for future generations," the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, a panel of roughly a dozen academics and nutrition experts, said in its recommendations to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services. The guidance will be used by those departments to revise the dietary guidelines, issued by the federal government about every five years and represented as color-coded food groups on a plate. The MyPlate symbol replaced the food pyramid in 2011.
With obesity rates high, it is unclear how much of an impact the guidelines have on the country's eating habits. But they do influence billions of dollars of spending on government food programs, including the school lunch standards and the Defense Department's menu guidelines.
The focus on sustainable diets is angering the meat industry, particularly beef producers, accused of taking a particularly heavy toll on the environment.
"The committee's foray into the murky waters of sustainability is well beyond its scope and expertise," said Barry Carpenter, president of the North American Meat Institute, which represents beef and poultry producers.
The meat industry believes the panel, which has been meeting for well over a year, is pursuing a broader antimeat agenda, even though it doesn't recommend specific daily reductions in meat or poultry consumption.
The trade group criticized the committee for not giving greater consideration to studies that provide evidence of the nutrient density of meat and poultry.
The committee recommended that Americans eat less red and processed meat, and excluded lean meat from a list of foods that make up a healthy diet. While lean meat is firmly endorsed in the current guidelines, the panel explained researchers don't yet have a standard definition for what qualifies as lean meat. It did acknowledge in a footnote that lean meat could have a role in a good diet.
Broadly speaking, the advisory committee said Americans eat too few fruits, vegetables and whole grains and far too much sodium and saturated fat.
"The quality of the diets currently consumed by the U.S. population is suboptimal overall and has major adverse health consequences," the panel said.
While the current dietary guidelines point out the need for sustainable agriculture, the advisory committee this time said a product's environmental footprint should be disclosed on food or menu labels.
According to Johns Hopkins University's Center for a Livable Future, large-scale animal operations can generate large amounts of waste, pollute waterways and produce greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
Ranchers and farmers counter that their production practices are actually "quite green" when looking at the environmental impact of meat on a per-calorie basis, as opposed to the number of pounds produced, the North American Meat Institute said.
Richard Thorpe, a physician and rancher in Winters, Texas, said he was "very disappointed" in the committee's recommendations, as the beef industry has worked to incorporate nutritional and environmental considerations into farm practices for decades.
"Our industry over the last 20 or 30 years has done nothing but reduce the amount of fat in our animal," Dr. Thorpe said.

Full text:   Regarding Daniel Henninger's "Vaccines and Politicized Science" (Wonder Land, Feb. 12): As an infectious-disease doctor, I am appalled at the current measles epidemic. It is almost completely preventable, yet it continues and spreads in our supposed advanced society. The current decline in science education, the belief that each individual's opinion is as valid as anyone else's, the willingness of our legislators to legislate nonscientific nonsense are all proof of the "dumbing down" of our country.

Daniel Henninger is supportive of the medical community that developed vaccinations and insists that they are safe, yet he bemoans "the eroding credibility and authority of science," which provide him an opportunity to take a swipe at scientists who have no involvement in climate change for "allowing the credibility of their profession to be put at risk with the broader population."
Mr. Henninger conjures up a scientific community too meek to join him in challenging climate change, while in reality most scientists think that climate change is a reality, that mankind contributes to climate change and that there is an urgent need to act.
If Mr. Henninger wants to look more closely at why science is distrusted, he should consider why, when a stage full of GOP seekers of their party's nomination in the 2012 primaries were asked whether they subscribed to the theory of evolution, only one, Jon Huntsman, dared to raise his hand. As with Chris Christie and Rand Paul, when they decided to pander to the anti-science voters in their party, many of the men on that stage know better.
Mr. Henninger might consider how public trust in science was eroded by "scientific" studies bankrolled by the tobacco industry to discredit the connection between cigarettes and assorted lethal illnesses. He might ask whether the public is being confused by scientists supported by grants from the energy industry busily demonstrating that climate change isn't the problem 97% of their colleagues believe it to be. He might ask why, when members of the GOP are asked for their opinions on climate change, they retreat to the feeble redoubt "we'll, I'm not a scientist."
No, Mr. Henninger, it isn't scientists who are playing with fire when they don't take up your anticlimate change perspective; it is you who needs to reconsider the role you are playing in discrediting science that you don't happen to like.

Full text:   NEW DELHI -- President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said they made tangible progress on a range of issues with movement on civil nuclear trade, defense cooperation and climate change.
With pageantry on full display, Mr. Obama appeared at India's annual Republic Day parade on Monday, a first for a U.S. leader. But the results of talks on key trade and security issues were more nuanced.
Mr. Obama described a "breakthrough" in long-stalled talks on allowing U.S. firms to invest in nuclear power plants in India. But U.S. officials said work remains on implementation by India, and some U.S. corporate officials said they are evaluating the outcome of the talks in New Delhi.
Both leaders touted security agreements, including renewal of a defense pact and a deal to jointly produce new defense technology. And Mr. Obama said they agreed on steps to promote clean energy and to tackle climate change.
None of Sunday's discussions amounted to a major accord. Still, coming on the heels of Mr. Modi's trip to Washington in September, both leaders declared the visit an unqualified success.
The burgeoning personal relationship between the two was on display from the moment of the arrival of the president and first lady Michelle Obama, when Mr. Modi departed from protocol and welcomed the U.S. president on the tarmac.
Mr. Obama greeted the Indian leader with an enthusiastic handshake and a hug.
The U.S. president later laid a wreath and planted a tree at a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, a personal hero of Mr. Obama's.
At a news conference, Mr. Obama joked that Mr. Modi had been received like a Bollywood star during his visit to the U.S. and said that the two leaders had compared sleep patterns.
"It turns out Mr. Modi is getting even less sleep than me," Mr. Obama said.
The two have been at an impasse over India's liability law, which would hold American suppliers responsible for accidents at the power plants they take part in building.
The U.S.-India nuclear deal, which was supposed to clear the way for the sale of nuclear reactors and fuel to India, was signed in 2008. But the 2010 passage of an Indian law making suppliers liable for accidents stalled progress.
Mr. Obama said he and Mr. Modi had achieved "breakthrough understandings" on two issues that were holding up progress, but he offered no specifics. Richard Verma, the U.S. ambassador to India, said teams from both countries had been working since September to resolve the liability issue and a second question of how to account for nuclear materials.
The agreement calls for a combination of insurance pools and Indian assurances that a "memorandum of law" -- essentially an executive action -- could be used to ensure that India is in compliance with international rules on liability.
"Now, ultimately, it's up to the companies to decide whether to go forward or not," he said.
A spokesman for GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, a prospective supplier, said the firm is reviewing the results of talks Sunday.
Mr. Obama has been pushing nations ahead of a summit in Paris later this year to reduce their carbon output, and has cited a landmark agreement with China's President Xi Jinping in November as a model.
In India, however, Mr. Obama said the U.S. would share more data and help India assess and adapt to climate change, and the two countries will pursue a global agreement at the Paris summit.
John Podesta, adviser to the president, said India's commitments on clean energy were more of an expansion of renewable energy use than an effort to shut down coal plants.

Abstract: Under its human-rights guidelines, fund managers could avoid investments or divest from a company that receives more than 10% of its revenue or raw materials from countries "demonstrating a prolonged and systematic pattern of human rights violations" or "conflict-affected areas where significant human rights violations have been widely documented."

Full text:   The United Methodist Church plans to exert the power of its $21 billion pension fund to influence companies whose activities conflict with church positions on climate change and human rights.
The move could result in divestment of stock in certain businesses, such as those that use coal, church investment managers said Thursday.
"The first thing we want to do is try and engage with those companies to try to persuade them to engage in practices that are more sustainable," said David Zellner, chief investment officer of the church's General Board of Pension and Health Benefits. "If we feel those efforts are futile and we don't feel we're making any progress, that would lead to us excluding them from our investments."
Mr. Zellner said he expects less than 1% of current investments to be affected by the policy.
Pension funds, foundations and endowments around the U.S. are wrestling with similar decisions. Many face pressure from activists to make investments based on social concerns but are reluctant to abandon those that help generate reliable returns.
Some universities have agreed to sell stock in fossil-fuel companies because of concerns over climate change. But prominent institutions with significant stakes in energy -- including Harvard, Yale and Brown universities -- have decided against a total withdrawal from such assets.
More than two dozen smaller American religious endowments or foundations have made commitments to divest themselves partly or fully of fossil-fuel holdings, according to 350.org, an international activist organization advocating such moves.
Though the Methodists' decision won't affect the bottom lines of fuel or power companies or the fund itself, it will influence the way people view the fossil-fuel industry and help "take away their social license," said 350.org spokesman Karthik Ganapathy.
The strategy from the second-largest U.S. Protestant denomination, with 12.5 million members, is likely to be closely watched by other faith-based investors, observers said.
Kirsty Jenkinson, the fund's sustainable-investment strategist, said researchers are analyzing the nearly 5,000 companies in which the fund invests to see which ones may be affected.
Under the policy, the church could exclude investment in any company in the developed world that generates half its revenue from the extraction of "thermal" coal -- the type burned by electric utilities -- or a utility that generates 75% or more of its power from coal -- unless that company plans to create at least 10% of its energy from renewable sources.
Only one-tenth of 1% of the church fund's U.S. equity investment is in companies that mine thermal coal, Mr. Zellner said.
Under its human-rights guidelines, fund managers could avoid investments or divest from a company that receives more than 10% of its revenue or raw materials from countries "demonstrating a prolonged and systematic pattern of human rights violations" or "conflict-affected areas where significant human rights violations have been widely documented."
The moves come after debate within the church over possibly divesting from companies with ties to Israeli operations in the West Bank over concerns about the treatment of Palestinians. The new guidelines don't mention Israel, though the church has issued statements opposing Israeli occupation and settlements of Palestinian territories in the West Bank.
The United Methodist Church has a history of divestment to follow its social agenda. It divested $77 million of stock in firms doing business with apartheid South Africa in the 1980s.

Abstract: The carbon-bubble argument that IOC stock values are wildly inflated because of unrealistic expectations about future profits from unproven reserves-- that may be "stranded" in the ground if the decarbonization lobby has its way -- is inconsistent with stock valuation and supply-demand facts.

Full text:   Nancy Meyer and Lysle Brinker effectively debunk "The Myth of the Carbon Investment 'Bubble'" (op-ed, Jan. 12) by showing that global integrated oil and gas company (IOC) stock prices are modestly priced based primarily on today's proven reserves. The carbon-bubble argument that IOC stock values are wildly inflated because of unrealistic expectations about future profits from unproven reserves-- that may be "stranded" in the ground if the decarbonization lobby has its way -- is inconsistent with stock valuation and supply-demand facts.
Common sense suggests that the IOC disinvestment pressure coming from carbon-bubble alarmists has been part of a self-fulfilling prophesy effort. Convincing institutional investors to dump IOC stocks because they are overpriced is intended to inflict pain on the oil and gas industries and make it more difficult to raise capital for future projects. And as the anticarbon front lobbies for more restrictive emissions policies, the bubble doomsayers point to potential climate-change policy as a development that will strand IOC assets and cause stock prices to plummet.
Relying on renewable-energy fanatics for useful valuation advice regarding nonrenewable-energy holdings isn't a smart idea -- even without delving into the facts. IOCs currently are suffering quite enough from a glut of oil and plunging prices, a dynamic that promises to make higher-priced renewable energy even less cost competitive. Maybe then it's the renewable-sector's assets that are overpriced and vulnerable to being stranded in money-losing projects that receive less federal subsidies in a less favorable climate for spending in Washington. That is climate change we should all appreciate.

Full text:   The year 2014 was the world's warmest on record, despite relatively cool temperatures across parts of North America, two U.S. agencies responsible for monitoring global climate trends said.
Climate experts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, working independently, calculated that the globally averaged temperature over land and ocean surfaces for 2014 was 58.24 degrees Fahrenheit, 1.24 degrees F (0.69 degrees celsius) above the 20th-century average, the highest among all years since recordkeeping began in 1880. By their reckoning, nine of the 10 warmest years now on record all occurred during the 21st century.
Many scientists attribute the warming temperatures to rising concentrations of carbon dioxide, soot and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and to land-use changes. Some skeptics, however, have suggested the rise in global temperatures has actually slowed since 1998, which was itself a record-warm year.
"Why do we think this is going on? The attribution of these long-term trends is a complicated fingerprinting exercise," but greenhouse-gas emissions play a major role, said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, who helped prepare the analysis.
The overall global temperature in 2014 masked considerable local variation, the climate analysts said. In the U.S., parts of the Midwest and East Coast were unusually cool, while Alaska and three Western states -- California, Arizona and Nevada -- experienced their warmest year on record.

Abstract: Administration officials note that methane, a primary component of natural gas, has a warming effect on the planet more than 20 times greater than carbon dioxide. Since 2005, domestic oil production has nearly doubled and natural-gas production has risen by about 50%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Full text:   The Obama administration unveiled plans Wednesday to regulate methane emissions from the nation's oil and natural-gas industry for the first time, a move aimed at meeting climate-change goals while not hampering the nation's energy boom.
The Environmental Protection Agency plans to propose federal regulations to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40% to 45% over the next decade from 2012 levels, White House and agency officials said Wednesday.
The rules, scheduled to be proposed this summer and completed by 2016, would apply only to new or modified sites. For existing oil and gas operations, the EPA is set to rely mostly on voluntary measures to cut methane, a move backed by the industry.
To reduce emissions, companies would have to install technology that prevents methane from being inadvertently leaked and monitor their operations for possible leaks. Many companies are already using this kind of equipment, according to industry executives and the EPA.
The new regulations are designed to help the administration meet a commitment it made in Beijing in November to reduce U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, as well as to bring political momentum to a United Nations summit this year where world leaders will decide whether to create a new climate agreement.
Administration officials say the EPA rules wouldn't hamper the growth of the oil and gas industry, a big economic driver during President Barack Obama's tenure. That view is shared by at least some energy executives.
"I don't see this as having a significant cost impact on our company at all," said Mark Boling, an executive vice president at Houston-based Southwestern Energy Co., one of the nation's largest producers of natural gas.
The action announced Wednesday represents a sort of middle ground between what environmental groups wanted and what the oil and natural-gas industries said they could support, though the administration left the door open for more expansive regulation later on.
While cheering the EPA's move toward regulation, some environmental groups criticized the administration for not regulating existing sources. However, the Clean Air Act would trigger regulation on existing sources eventually if the agency pursues rules affecting new sources.
"The administration is proposing to fight methane pollution with one hand tied behind its back, not using the full range of powers under the Clean Air Act to cut these emissions," said Conrad Schneider, advocacy director of the Clean Air Task Force.
Despite skepticism from some environmentalists, the administration has supported natural gas as an energy source in part because it puts out fewer carbon emissions than coal or oil.
At the same time, the administration and environmental groups are increasingly worried about the effects of natural-gas use on climate change as the U.S. produces more of the fuel. Administration officials note that methane, a primary component of natural gas, has a warming effect on the planet more than 20 times greater than carbon dioxide.
Since 2005, domestic oil production has nearly doubled and natural-gas production has risen by about 50%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Methane emissions from the sector have dropped roughly 15% over that period through 2012, according to EPA data, but the agency estimates that these emissions will rise 25% over the next decade if steps aren't taken to cut them.
Trade groups representing the oil and gas industry were more critical than some individual companies of Wednesday's announcement.
Marty Durbin, CEO of America's Natural Gas Alliance, a trade group representing natural-gas producers including Southwestern, said he was "disappointed the administration is choosing to take a regulatory approach that will take years to implement, rather than a cooperative approach with the industry that we believe will ultimately result in greater emissions reductions in a shorter time frame."
Reaction on Capitol Hill was split -- with Republicans, who now control both chambers of Congress, criticizing the move and vowing swift oversight, and Democrats commending the administration's actions.
Many independent analysts concluded the EPA's actions were, for now anyway, a positive result for the industry because the rules could have been more expansive. ClearView Energy Partners, a nonpartisan energy analysis firm, said in a research note that the outcome is "generally beneficial for industry."

Abstract: President Barack Obama is under increased pressure to decide the fate of the Keystone XL pipeline after a Nebraska court on Friday threw out a challenge to the long-disputed project and the House passed a bill approving it. Since last April, the Obama administration has cited the court case over the pipeline's proposed route through Nebraska as the reason Mr. Obama hasn't acted on the project.

Administration officials have also pointed to a continuing State Department review to explain Mr. Obama's threat to veto a congressional bill on the pipeline, which garnered a 266-153 vote and now heads to the Senate.
The proposed pipeline -- which would move up to 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries -- has become a political flash point over climate change and economic growth. TransCanada Corp., the company behind the project, submitted its permit application in 2008 to the State Department, which has jurisdiction over cross-border pipelines.
The Nebraska ruling sets in motion what is expected to be the final chapter of the yearslong review, but when and how it will end remain uncertain. A State Department spokeswoman said Friday that there was no timeline to complete the agency's review, indicating it could be months before an administration decision.
"The president believes the process should unfold at the State Department," White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. "We're going to wait for that review to be completed before the president makes any decisions."
The State Department review, known as a national-interest determination, considers several factors, including the pipeline's impact on energy security, the environment and climate change, geopolitics and the economy. The department will soon receive input from eight other federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, before making its decision.
In comments since the November election, Mr. Obama has indicated he doesn't think the pipeline is economically beneficial to Americans, leading to a growing consensus among his aides that he will reject it.
"It's very good for Canadian oil companies, and it's good for the Canadian oil industry, but it's not going to be a huge benefit to U.S. consumers. It's not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers,"Mr. Obama said at a Dec. 19 news conference.
Supporters say Keystone would create thousands of construction jobs and is the safest way to move oil that would otherwise be transported in less secure ways, such as by rail.
Opponents say the pipeline would promote the use of a kind of oil that releases more carbon into air, go against the wishes of some landowners along the route and deepen U.S. dependence on fossil fuels when it should be addressing climate change.
Some experts say that cheap gasoline -- prices at the pump have dropped more than a dollar since this time last year -- could provide political cover for Mr. Obama if he rejects the project.
TransCanada Chief Executive Russ Girling cheered Friday's ruling court and said he hopes the State Department can quickly pick up where it left off last year. He also indicated that his company would keep pursuing the project as long as there is a demand from oil shippers, even if Mr. Obama rejects it.
"In the event of a negative decision, that need [from oil shippers] doesn't go away, so what we would have to understand is the reason for a denial, if you will, and then understand what we'd have to do to meet the conditions," Mr. Girling said on a conference call with reporters Friday.
While the State Department completes its review, Mr. Obama could be forced to follow through on his promise to veto legislation backing the project, which is expected to clear the Senate in coming weeks after the House passage on Friday.
Keystone is expected to be among the topics of discussion during Mr. Obama's Tuesday meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders at the White House.
"President Obama is out of excuses for deciding whether or not to allow thousands of Americans to get back to work," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said in a written statement on Friday.
All sides of the Keystone fight agreed on Friday the decision now lies with Mr. Obama, indicating the Nebraska ruling is likely the end of the challenge brought by state landowners. The state's top court, in a split decision, threw out a lower-court ruling that had found a 2012 state law on pipeline oversight unconstitutional. The law passed by the state Legislature gave Nebraska's governor the power to review and approve certain pipelines, including Keystone.
Four of the court's seven judges concluded the state pipeline law was unconstitutional, but state law requires five judges to reach that conclusion. The result nullified a lower court holding that had favored landowners seeking to block the pipeline. Some legal experts said the landowners may have a small opening to appeal or bring a new case since the court didn't answer the constitutionality question.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Congress moved closer to a likely approval of the Keystone XL pipeline Thursday, as a Senate panel advanced the legislation and the House prepared for a vote on Friday.
The Keystone bill is expected to trigger a wide-ranging debate on energy policy in both chambers, with Democrats seeking to draw attention to climate change and Republicans making their case that the pipeline would create jobs and solidify the nation's position as a global energy power.
The pipeline, which would deliver up to 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to the Gulf Coast, has been delayed for years and has become a political flash point in the debate about climate change and economic growth -- issues expected to be on display on the House and Senate floors.
Both chambers are expected to pass the bill, and the White House has threatened a veto.
The Republican-controlled Senate is scheduled to begin debating the bill on Monday, with senators allowed to offer a range of amendments to the bill, under a pledge by new Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to open up the legislative process.
One expected result is that senators on both sides of the aisle will offer amendments aimed at putting members of the opposing party on the record on controversial issues such as climate change and environmental regulations.
Thursday's debate by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee offered a sense of both parties' strategies on the Keystone bill. Democrats -- with the exception of Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- argued the pipeline would contribute to climate change and are using the debate to bring attention to the issue.
Republicans point to the jobs they say the pipeline would create, and they also cite a review from the State Department that concluded it wouldn't have a significant impact on climate change.
"The case for approving the Keystone XL pipeline is clear and obvious. The majority of Americans want this built. Let's get it built," said freshman Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.), who ousted former Sen. Mary Landrieu (D., La.) in a runoff election last month.
The panel advanced the legislation with a 13-9 vote.
The committee approved the bill with no amendments, with the expectation they would be voted on when the full Senate considers the bill next week.
Among the amendments tabled until that debate was a sense-of-Congress resolution from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), which would have put Congress on record agreeing with the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by human activity, largely by burning of coal, oil and natural gas, and that the U.S. should act swiftly to move off fossil fuels.
Democrats on the committee also said Congress shouldn't interfere with ongoing litigation in Nebraska over concerns of people living along the pipeline's route. Some Democrats also accused Republicans of being beholden to industry money.
"Why is this bill so urgent? The answer is money," said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), one of several new committee members who have helped shape a more liberal Democratic side of the panel. "The pipeline might not do much for the American people, but it's worth a lot to the Canadian oil industry."
The White House said earlier this week that President Barack Obama would veto legislation authorizing the pipeline because it would interfere with a continuing review process at the State Department.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), the new chairman of the energy committee, said that almost certain fate shouldn't stymie the congressional action.
"It is unfortunate that the administration continues to stand in the way, even threatening to veto this important legislation," Ms. Murkowski said before the vote during the panel's first gathering under the new Congress. "I don't think that that threat should deter us as a committee, as a Senate, and really, as a Congress."
Shortly after November's elections, the newly empowered congressional Republicans quickly signaled that they would make passing legislation approving the project a top priority.
Pipeline owner TransCanada Corp., of Calgary, Alberta, first submitted its application more than six years ago to the State Department, which has jurisdiction over cross-border pipelines.
The State Department has said it won't make a final decision until litigation concerning the pipeline's route in Nebraska is resolved, which is expected to occur sometime early this year.

Full text:   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Jerry Brown began an unprecedented fourth term as California governor, occupying an unusual position in Democratic politics: a successfully re-elected governor in the nation's most populous state with seemingly no ambition for a 2016 presidential bid.
With Democratic majorities in the state Legislature, California's budget crisis subdued and Republicans in control of Congress in Washington, Mr. Brown is in a position to push a Democratic agenda on a scale perhaps not possible elsewhere in the U.S.
But in an inaugural speech Monday, Mr. Brown reiterated the state must live within its means. "In 2011, we were handed a mess and through solid, steady work, we turned it around," he said. "While we have not reached the Promised Land, we have much to be proud of."
The 76-year-old governor -- who previously served from 1975 to 1983 -- also signaled he intends to make enacting climate-change policy a hallmark of his legacy.
Mr. Brown proposed new environmental goals to be enacted over the next 15 years. Among them, increasing to 50% from 33% the amount of electricity derived from renewable sources in the state -- a move that would put California far beyond the rest of the country. He also proposed reducing the use of petroleum in cars and trucks by up to half.
"Taking significant amounts of carbon out of our economy without harming its vibrancy is exactly the sort of challenge at which California excels," Mr. Brown told legislators.
Mr. Brown aims to tap funds from auctioning carbon-dioxide emissions permits to help pay for the construction of the nation's first high-speed rail line, a $68 billion project that spurred lawsuits by opponents. He is also pursuing a set of $25 billion tunnels to divert water past an ecologically sensitive river delta.
Both projects received criticism from Republicans in the state Legislature. "I am disappointed that in his fifth year, Gov. Brown is still off chasing tunnels and trains instead of putting forward a plan to spur economic growth in California or to ensure our schools are preparing students for a 21st century economy," Assembly Republican Leader Kristin Olsen said.
Mr. Brown plans to release a draft budget proposal Friday. Advocates for social programs will be watching to see if he boosts spending in areas such as health care and services for the poor.
Mr. Brown inherited a state government in 2011 with a projected $25 billion deficit. He proposed deep cuts to close the gap. An improving economy and a temporary tax rise have helped improve the fiscal situation.

Full text:   Prospects for approval of the Keystone XL pipeline are dimming amid two recent developments: lower gasoline prices and increased skepticism from President Barack Obama, whose administration has been reviewing the proposed pipeline for more than six years.
Mr. Obama last week said he had doubts the pipeline would benefit the U.S., buttressing remarks he has made publicly at least three other times since early November. He said it wouldn't create many permanent jobs or cut gas prices, as the project's supporters have argued
"It's very good for Canadian oil companies, and it's good for the Canadian oil industry, but it's not going to be a huge benefit to U.S. consumers," Mr. Obama said.
Many analysts say falling U.S. gas prices boost the argument of Keystone opponents that Canadian oil isn't necessary amid the current global oversupply.
"Generally, the public is typically more sympathetic to pro-oil-production policies when gasoline prices are high," said Michael Levi, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "And when gasoline prices are low, that can create room for policies that impede production."
Proponents have pressed repeatedly for Keystone's approval and intend to do so again in early 2015. Republicans, who will control both chambers of Congress next year, plan to act in January on legislation aimed at forcing approval of the pipeline.
"President Obama's comments about the Keystone XL pipeline today were more of the same and just not accurate," said Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.), a key Senate supporter, the latest remarks. Mr. Hoeven said he will work to ensure legislation approving Keystone clears Congress.
Keystone XL, which would send as many as 830,000 barrels of oil a day 1,700 miles from Canada's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries, has become a flash point in the nation's debate over energy independence, economic growth and climate change. Opponents say approving the pipeline would indicate the U.S. was deepening its dependence on fossil fuels. Supporters say Keystone would create thousands of jobs and is the safest way to move oil that would otherwise be transported in less secure ways, such as by rail.
Calgary-based TransCanada Corp. in 2008 applied for a permit for the project from the State Department, which reviews cross-border pipelines.
The administration has been waiting for the Nebraska Supreme Court to rule on a lawsuit brought by landowners who challenged a state law used to approve the pipeline's path. That ruling is expected in the coming weeks and could clear the way for the administration to decide.
In making its decision -- known as the national interest determination -- the State Department considers energy security as well as environmental, geopolitical and economic impacts. Together, Mr. Obama's recent comments suggest he doesn't think Keystone is in the nation's interest.
The president hasn't always been so publicly skeptical. In March 2012, he stood alongside pipes in Cushing, Okla., and said his administration had approved dozens of oil and natural-gas pipelines, including from Canada.
"As long as I'm president, we're going to keep on encouraging oil development and infrastructure and we're going to do it in a way that protects the health and safety of the American people," he said then.
People familiar with Mr. Obama's thinking say he believes the pipeline's symbolic and political importance outweighs its impact on the economy and climate change. Keystone has become bound up with his goal of making climate-change action a legacy of his presidency. Global oil prices may make it easier for him to reject Keystone. When the State Department issued an environmental assessment in January, prices were between $94 and $110 a barrel. Now they are between $55 and $61.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The White House is calling on federal agencies to consider the climate-change impact of a wide range of energy projects that require government approval.
The draft guidelines, released Thursday by the White House's Council on Environmental Quality, are likely to affect fossil-fuel projects the most, such as pipelines, terminals that export coal and liquefied natural gas, and production of oil, natural gas and coal on public lands.
Business and energy interests complained when the White House signaled almost three years ago that it planned such a change that it could slow federal reviews. Some congressional Democrats support the move.
The guidance doesn't affect the Keystone XL pipeline, whose review already has considered climate change, according to an administration official.
The draft guidance spells out how different agencies, such as the Interior Department, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Army Corps of Engineers, should consider the greenhouse-gas emissions of projects that require environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act. It also encourages agencies to consider alternatives that have smaller carbon footprints.
If an agency determines it doesn't want to weigh such climate impacts, it must explain why not.
Current law requires the government to consider local environmental concerns about projects, but not global problems such as climate change.
How significant of an impact the guidelines could have will become clearer as projects go through the normal government review with this additional consideration. The White House is seeking comment for 60 days and then will issue final guidance, though it wasn't clear when that would occur.

Abstract: Neil Vitale, a dairy farmer in New York's Southern Tier region, said he had hoped that leasing land to energy companies would help him pay property taxes on some 700 acres of farmland. According to state data, Pennsylvania's energy employment has more than doubled from 13,059 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 to 28,229 in early 2014.

Full text:   ALBANY, N.Y. -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration said Wednesday it would prohibit hydraulic fracturing statewide, citing health concerns and calling the economic benefits to drilling in New York state limited.
The long-awaited decision seals off about 12 million acres of the Marcellus Shale, an underground rock formation with natural-gas reserves that have helped fuel an energy-production boom in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. New York would be the first state with significant potential to become a major gas producer to ban fracking.
Mr. Cuomo's health and environment commissioners said that, after a review, the risks of allowing fracking outweighed the economic benefits.
"I cannot support high-volume hydraulic fracturing," acting health Commissioner Howard Zucker said at a news conference, adding that he wouldn't allow his own children to live near a fracking site. He said the "cumulative concerns" about fracking "give me reason to pause."
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation will issue a legally binding recommendation prohibiting fracking as a result of Dr. Zucker's conclusion.
With the decision, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, came down on the side of environmentalists who had been pressuring him since he took office in January 2011 to make permanent a 2009 moratorium on fracking. Among those supporters was Mr. Cuomo's close friend and former brother-in-law, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
"It's one of the first examples of a high-level U.S. politician who is willing to stand up to the carbon-energy industry," Mr. Kennedy said Wednesday.
The move drew immediate fire from energy producers and some local communities that saw fracking as a way to revive moribund economies, and they vowed to challenge the decision. Towns along the Pennsylvania border have watched with chagrin as jobs and money poured into the neighboring state while New York's economy stagnated.
Neil Vitale, a dairy farmer in New York's Southern Tier region, said he had hoped that leasing land to energy companies would help him pay property taxes on some 700 acres of farmland.
"The amount of shale available is more valuable than the surface of the land will ever be," he said. "The state controls the most valuable part of our farm."
Fracking uses high-pressure water and materials, such as sand and chemicals to break open cracks in rock deep underground.
New York's decision comes just as crude-oil prices have crashed. The price of U.S. crude has plunged from about $107 a barrel in mid-June to $55 on Wednesday. Natural-gas prices collapsed to $1.91 per million British thermal units in April 2012, then recovered and have averaged $4.30 so far in 2014.
In the face of the collapse in crude, energy companies are starting to cut back how many wells they plan to drill and frack next year. In the short term, it is unclear if there is any appetite for companies to explore for oil and gas in New York, but longer term, there are huge population centers along the East Coast that could benefit from less-expensive fuel pumped in the region.
In Pennsylvania, energy companies have generated more than $2.1 billion in state and local taxes since the fracking boom began, the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group, said Wednesday. Funds have supported road and bridge construction, water and sewer projects, local housing initiatives and parks.
According to state data, Pennsylvania's energy employment has more than doubled from 13,059 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 to 28,229 in early 2014. The average salary for those jobs is roughly $93,000 a year, more than $40,000 higher than the state average.
Still, communities across the country have moved to ban fracking, including several in the November election, such as Denton, Texas; Athens, Ohio; and two California counties.
Last year, Mr. Cuomo said he expected a decision before this November's election, but it ended up being delayed. He said Wednesday the decision was made by his commissioners, not him. "I don't think I even have a role here," he said.
There remains deep dispute about whether fracking poses health risks to people who live nearby. Dr. Zucker said he saw numerous red flags in the "significant uncertainties about the kinds of adverse health outcomes that may be associated with" fracking. But Lisa McKenzie, an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Public Health who has co-written two studies on the health impacts of drilling in her state, said: "I think there is a potential for health effects, but how significant, we need to do more study."

Rationales for Move
Potential health and environmental impacts include drinking-water and soil contamination, and methane releases tied to climate change.
Costs associated with regulating fracking could overwhelm local and state governments.
Much of the Marcellus Shale couldn't be drilled, partly as a result of a court decision upholding towns' authority to prohibit fracking.
Potential negative consequences for communities include increased truck traffic, noise and odor.

Full text:   LIMA, Peru -- The U.S. and other wealthy countries persuaded their developing-nation peers to advance a framework that for the first time would spread the burden of economically painful emission cuts across all nations.
The compromise reached early Sunday -- part of negotiations aimed at reaching a final, comprehensive climate pact next year in Paris -- would require every country to submit plans for cutting their carbon footprints in the coming months. The final deal being negotiated would be a departure from earlier agreements that put the responsibility of such cuts only on highly industrialized countries.
But 13 days of talks in Lima also showed that a North-South divide remains over which countries should shoulder most of the costs of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. A public rift opened on the final day of talks, threatening to derail progress and highlighting the challenges that broader negotiations will face before the final conference begins in November in Paris.
"In the negotiating room, countries had a very tough time shifting gears," said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonpartisan think tank. "They got through Lima by largely skirting the issue for now. It's hard to see that flying in Paris."
Most of the thorny issues, such as how to finance poorer countries' reductions and preparations for extreme climatic events, were left for later meetings. That omission will increase the diplomatic heavy-lifting required to reach a final agreement in 2015.
The talks, organized by the United Nations, were designed to put countries on track to limit global average temperature gains to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels over coming decades, a goal previously set by world leaders. Environmentalists warn that the framework that is emerging won't put countries on track to meet that goal in Paris.
Before the latest agreement, major economies -- the U.S., European Union and other countries -- threw out the old idea of a treaty with uniform emissions cuts and backed a system where all countries submit their own proposals to trim carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases linked to climate change.
In November, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping jointly announced their pledges to cut carbon emissions after 2020, when an existing international climate deal expires. The move was aimed at prodding other countries to commit to ambitious targets.
Like many countries, though, the U.S. faces strong domestic political opposition to cutting emissions in ways that could weigh on the economy. Republican lawmakers have vowed to stop the Obama administration's regulations on power plants, a key part of the American offering in the global climate talks.
After the high-level phase of the Lima talks got off to a slow start last week, Secretary of State John Kerry made a surprise visit, urging countries not to get bogged down in "debates over who should do what.
"I am confident we can rise above the debates that have dragged us down," Mr. Kerry told attendees last week. "It's everyone's responsibility."
Some observers said the final language of the plan, which emphasized countries' "different national circumstances," won't ensure that all nations develop ambitious emissions plans that can stand up to outside review and meet U.N. goals.
"For most countries, they're going to be the comfortable goals they know they can meet and maybe exceed," said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a Washington think tank.
Still, participants applauded the latest plan as a way to sign up a broader group of countries to limit emissions for decades in the future, when today's emerging markets are expected to have enlarged economies with greater energy needs. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol put the burden for curbing emissions solely on developed economies.
"The No. 1 requirement is participants, not depth of cuts," said Tim Groser, New Zealand's trade and climate minister. "We're not going to get rid of oil in the next 50 years, for God's sake."

Full text:   LIMA, Peru -- Wilfredo Saavedra, a former Marxist rebel, led a convoy of some 300 activists from Peru's northern sierra, wearing an anti-mining T-shirt and Cuban baseball cap. Jim Chomicz, 70, from Birmingham, Alabama, flew here with a church group.
Both came to Lima for the People's Climate Summit, an alternative to the United Nations climate negotiations, which opened Dec. 1 and ended Friday. The two men agree on the urgent need to tackle global warming. But like the government negotiators trying to hash out a climate deal, they don't agree on how this should be done.
For Mr. Chomicz and other environmentalists who converged on the Peruvian capital, the goal is to build a green economy by phasing out fossil fuels. "You need the market to dig and export resources, but the companies need to respect the environment," said Mr. Chomicz.
But for many of their Latin American counterparts, it is all about toppling capitalism, which they blame for the environmental degradation.
"Capitalism is the creator of all of these changes to the climate," said Mr. Saavedra.
At a march this week, Ibis Fernandez, a Peruvian union leader and organizer of the People's Climate Summit, summed up the view of many Latin American activists.
"Raise your fist to change the system, and not the climate," she cried to a crowd of protesters, repeating a slogan taken from late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
In many ways, the divide among these groups over tackling climate change is a microcosm of the broader gulf between governments that have struggled to reconcile the positions of rich countries that are the main source of carbon dioxide emissions and poorer nations that have experienced rapid development over the past decade thanks to a global commodities boom.
At the U.N. talks, Venezuela's Foreign Minister Rafael Ramirez blasted capitalism as a "predatory system." But he stressed that his government wouldn't accept limitations on its huge and heavily subsidized oil industry. Mr. Ramirez said developed countries should assume the costs for pollution.
Bolivian President Evo Morales, whose country has clocked impressive economic growth because of natural-gas production and agricultural development, called for an "anticolonialist" climate agreement that would end the pillaging of "mother earth."
"Our focus is, together with the people of the world, to attack the capitalist system," he said.
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry pointed out that more than half of global emissions are now coming from developing countries.
The ideological rift between activists who came to the People's Climate Summit actually boiled over last month in Venezuela, during a meeting to write a declaration to present at the U.N. negotiations.
The talks reached an impasse when many Latin American environmental groups insisted on a resolution that blamed the "current capitalist hegemonic system." Grass-roots organizers from other areas, including Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, said they were shocked that the meeting was twisted into a debate over socialism versus capitalism.
A compromise was eventually reached that didn't blame capitalism but failed to mention reducing fossil fuels for countries like Venezuela, which heavily subsidizes gasoline.
The organizers of the People's Climate Summit issued a statement Thursday lambasting the "patriarchal-capitalist system that maintains oppression" and rejecting market-based mechanisms as a way to resolve climate change.

Full text:   Rupert Darwall suspects that President Obama will agree to a global climate deal at next year's United Nations Convention on Climate Change, and that he will implement America's commitment through executive action ("Obama Puts Climate on the 2016 Ballot," op-ed, Dec. 2). Mr. Darwall believes that Mr. Obama's unilateral approach to climate-change policy "has the makings of a winning issue" for the GOP when U.S. taxpayers realize that they will be subject to escalating cash calls to help the developing world decarbonize.
Whether this is a net positive for GOP presidential prospects isn't so clear. Millennials (voters under the age of 30) represented 15% of votes in 2012 and favored President Obama by 23%. A 50/50 split of the youth vote in a few key states would have made Mr. Obama a one-termer. Millennials have been steeped in climate-change broth and lectured by educators, the media and the White House that atonement is needed for colonialism and centuries of white Western privilege. Climate policy offers the potential to inspire millennials in 2016 to validate America's green-energy progress. Higher-income American taxpayers who would finance most of this may not have the electoral impact of millennials, much less that of all non-taxpayers.
Costly decarbonization of the U.S. and transfer payments to developing nations for their decarbonization are cousins of Obama administration domestic policies that disproportionately benefited those who were victimized by America in the past. Reparations for damage wrought by Western colonialism would be a nonstarter, but decarbonization payments to save the planet might be a backdoor way to the same objective, though Earth's climate refuses to conform to climate-change models, much to the chagrin of researchers and developing nations awaiting a downpour of American greenbacks.

Full text:   The push for a global climate deal is leading to calls for large cutbacks in the use of coal, provoking stiff opposition from coal producers and exporting countries.
Representatives from nearly 200 governments wrapped up talks on Friday that began Dec. 1 in an effort to reach an agreement next year for cutting carbon dioxide emissions after 2020. The goal is eventually limiting global warming to a total of 2 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial levels.
Many developed economies, which are cutting coal's share of electricity production at home and promoting other fuels, are discouraging governments and international institutions from investing in new coal plants that would feed the growing energy appetite of poorer countries.
"Coal is a source of energy that the past was based on, not a source that the future will be based on," said Susan McDade, deputy assistant administrator of the United Nations Development Program, which finances projects in developing countries.
The head of the Chinese delegation noted that Tokyo wasn't following its example of submitting an early target for reduced carbon dioxide emissions, in effect highlighting Japan's reliance on coal after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Japan's envoy said the coal-dependence "situation is going to be improved."
But the anticoal rhetoric is putting coal's champions on the defensive and stirring political opposition back home, including in the U.S., as industry giants seek to promote coal as a cheap fuel for developing countries.
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop defended her government's explicitly pro-coal stance, saying the country has committed more than $300 million to developing low-emissions coal technology.
Representatives of the coal industry organized a panel in Lima aiming to dissuade investors and endowments from divesting from their fuel.
As part of the international talks, the Obama administration is offering an emissions plan that relies heavily on reducing emissions at coal plants. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced his country's plan alongside President Barack Obama last month, pledging to stop increasing his country's carbon emissions by 2030 and boost the share of nonfossil fuels to 20% of the energy supply. Beijing also said it would cap coal use. The European Union promised deep emissions cuts in October.
But after leading industrialized economies -- including China, the biggest source of emissions -- pledge to make cuts, some participants worry that developing countries, including India, will pick up the slack, potentially boosting coal consumption in inefficient plants with high levels of pollution.
To keep richer countries' extra coal from being burned in poorer countries, the U.S., World Bank, United Nations and others are curtailing funding for coal-fired electricity.
Coal-industry leaders say that approach is wrong, and that public money instead should go toward making coal plants cleaner and on technology to capture most of the plants' carbon dioxide emissions.
"The climate negotiations really need to look for a way to help them use coal in the cleanest and most efficient way responsible," said Benjamin Sporton, acting chief executive of the World Coal Association in London. "Without carbon capture and storage, there's a fair chance you might struggle to achieve that 2-degrees target."
In the U.S., Republicans this past week used legislation that would fund the government next year to hinder President Obama's efforts to limit investments by U.S. agencies in overseas coal-fired power plants. The party is also seeking to use gains in congressional elections to roll back the Environmental Protection Agency's power-plant regulations.
The U.S. has doubled coal exports in the past decade, and miners around the world want to preserve their ability to extract and export coal, even if political pressure makes it harder to use the fuel at home.
"The countries that have said 'no' to coal haven't been as successful economically," said Vic Svec, senior vice president of investor relations at Peabody Energy Corp., the biggest nonstate coal producer.
Deck Slone, vice president of strategy and public policy for St. Louis-based coal miner Arch Coal Inc., the second-largest U.S. coal producer, says it would prefer investment in technology that reduces coal-related emissions instead of setting "near-term targets for lower emissions that constrain the economy."
Overall, new government policies are expected to help slow the growth in coal demand to 0.5% a year through 2040, compared with growth of 2.5% during the past 30 years, according to the International Energy Agency. A global pact to meet the main climate-change goal under discussion in Lima would cut significantly more from future demand.

Full text:   LIMA, Peru -- Nations negotiating a climate-change deal are unlikely to agree on cutting carbon-dioxide emissions deeply enough to prevent the earth from warming by 2 degrees Celsius, the stated goal of the talks, participants said.
Officials from nearly 200 countries spent the day arguing over a framework for cutting enough greenhouse-gas emissions in coming decades to limit temperature gains that leading scientific models predict will occur.
As part of the agreement expected next year in Paris, each country is expected to submit its own plan for cutting emissions beyond 2020.
The three biggest sources of carbon dioxide -- China, the U.S. and the European Union -- have already made their pledges, and other leading economies are expected to do so by March.
But officials involved in the talks worry the other countries won't agree to cut emissions deeply enough in 2015 to put their economies on a path likely to achieve the temperature goal.
To make up the difference, the agreement will likely allow governments to step cup their proposed cuts every five years or so.
"The reality is that in the first iteration you won't get enough ambition to get to 2 degrees," which is about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, said Rachel Kyte, the World Bank's special envoy for climate change.
"That's painful for a number of countries that suffer very, very much, well before we get to 2 degrees," she said.
The World Bank says that while current temperatures are only 0.8 degree above preindustrial times, significantly more warming is baked in given the current and predicted gases in the atmosphere.
At the same time, deeper-than-expected emissions cuts from smaller countries, or adjusted pledges from the three big economies, could bring the temperature goal within reach.

Full text:   LIMA -- Officials from nearly 200 countries working to negotiate a climate-change agreement are wrestling with the most basic question: whether key sections of the final pact should be legally binding.
The European Union made it clear from the start of talks here that the climate deal set for completion next year should be airtight under international law, with legal consequences if countries stray from commitments.
"The European Union favors an agreement with binding greenhouse-gas reduction targets for all countries," said Miguel Arias Canete, the EU's energy and climate commissioner.
The U.S., the other giant economy active in the negotiations, is backing a hybrid approach developed by New Zealand. Under that plan, countries would be required to have an emission-cutting plan that would be enforced through domestic laws but not be binding under international law.
"We think that there's a lot of merit in that idea," said Todd Stern, the U.S. special envoy for climate change.
Legal wrangling over emissions targets is one among many divisive issues negotiators are tackling at a new round of climate talks organized by the United Nations. Countries are also debating everything from the financing of expensive shifts to more renewable energy use to the responsibilities of rich versus poor countries for adapting to climate change.
On the thorny legal questions, the U.S., EU and other participants are looking for a solution that would persuade ambivalent countries to sign up to cut as much carbon as possible over decades, while minimizing the risk of a political backlash that would undo that commitment.
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol ran into trouble in North America when the U.S. never ratified it and Canada later withdrew. The accord also didn't require cuts from China, now the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide.
The U.S. is counting on the idea that a more-relaxed framework will bring everyone to the table and that countries will come under pressure at home and abroad to cut more carbon voluntarily if their commitments fall short or they fail to abide by them.
The Obama administration is looking to do its own legal heavy lifting through domestic law, including federal regulations on power plants and vehicle fuel efficiency. Republicans have denounced the power-plant rules, a key part of the U.S. offering in the current talks, as a "war on coal" and vowed to fight them.
The most divisive legal issues are unlikely to be worked out until national leaders get involved at meetings next year, officials say.
"That's such a crunchtime issue that it's going to be difficult to see that being resolved here in Lima," said Elina Bardram, the EU's senior climate negotiator.

Full text:   The U.S., Europe and China are about to confront the gulf between their carbon-cutting ambitions and those of less industrialized countries.
President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping surprised many observers last month by jointly unveiling long-range plans to curb carbon-dioxide emissions. The move followed a pledge by the other big carbon-emitting economy, the European Union, to reduce greenhouse gases as part of a new round of United Nations-led climate negotiations.
Those talks have begun this week in Lima, Peru, and will continue on a higher level next week. But officials and experts say there is little evidence most other developing economies will follow China's lead. The talks are supposed to produce an agreement in Paris next year.
"The risk is a revolt by the South against the North, saying that, 'You caused this problem and now we're going to pay the price,' " said Paul Bledsoe, a former U.S. official and climate expert at the German Marshall Fund, a U.S.-based think tank.
The rift began with the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which put the onus of emissions reductions on the highly industrialized countries that relied heavily on fossil fuels for many decades.
Since then, rapidly emerging economies with big populations and expanding middle classes -- China and India, above all -- have overtaken many developed counterparts in burning coal and other fuels that scientists have linked to global warming.
Many of these countries, including a number of energy producers, don't want to imperil their growth if richer countries can make the cuts needed to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels over coming decades -- a goal world leaders set at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit.
Resistance from some developing countries has spoiled other rounds of talks and could do the same in Lima, which officials describe as the launch of the most promising set of negotiations in years.
American and other officials are seeking to blur the old, two-way standoff by encouraging every nation to develop its own emissions-reduction plan to fit its growth expectations and abilities. The major economies are expected to submit detailed plans by March that will then stir wider domestic and international debates.
The stakes are high. Environmentalists warn inadequate results could lead to higher sea levels and widespread droughts, while opponents in the U.S. and other countries say stricter emission rules could sap economic growth and harm the energy industry.
In the U.S., next year's Republican Senate majority is expected to try to stop President Obama from using Environmental Protection Agency rules to limit power-plant emissions, a key part of the administration's offering in the global talks.
One country clearly on edge over the new push -- and China's aggressive targets -- is India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is examining a strategy of clearly differentiating India from China and arguing for a much later period for reaching peak emissions, officials say.

Full text:   The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru, this week and next will lay the groundwork for a more significant gathering in Paris a year from now: the 21st conference of the 1992 United Nations Convention on Climate Change. The third such conference, in 1997, produced the Kyoto Protocol, the much-heralded but ineffective plan to cut greenhouse-gas emissions without applying to developing nations. The 15th conference, held in Copenhagen five years ago to draw up a successor treaty, collapsed spectacularly under determined opposition from China and India.
The Paris conference, also intended to bring about an agreement covering all the world's emitters, promises to be different -- if only in the way it influences the next U.S. presidential election.
The Obama administration drew two lessons from Copenhagen. First, that the key to getting a global climate deal in Paris would be to secure first a bilateral one with China. Second, that seeking a binding treaty is overambitious and unnecessary. An accord that doesn't require Senate approval would suffice. America's international commitments could be implemented by executive actions.
From President Obama's viewpoint, developments are moving in the right direction. At Copenhagen, China's posture was that its carbon-intensity target was its own affair. But on Nov. 12 Mr. Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China had agreed not to exceed its carbon emissions at 2030 levels, while the U.S. would double the pace of America's greenhouse-gas reductions.
The consequence is that the fate of the current attempt to agree on a global climate pact won't be decided around the negotiating tables in Paris a year from now, but by American voters in November 2016. President Obama has all but guaranteed that where candidates stand on implementing a Paris climate accord will be a campaign issue.
As the president pointed out in the context of immigration reform, "the very nature of an executive action means that a future president could reverse those actions." A vote in the Senate to ratify a treaty would settle the issue. And by avoiding the Senate and leaving the issue open, President Obama will be forcing his fellow Democrats to defend his energy policies through the next election.
They will have a lot to defend. Hardly anyone thinks that the president's agreement with China will have much of an impact on climate control. In general, climate-policy skeptics have played down the significance of China's pledge to peak its emissions. Some argue that given China's demographic curve, China is only signaling what it would be doing anyway and is unlikely to legally commit to capping its carbon emissions. Critics of the Beijing deal, meanwhile, rightly point out that even on the basis of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-approved science, it does very little to delay the anticipated rise in global temperature (although that's something that nature is taking care of itself for the time being). The 2030 target gives China's leadership a perverse incentive to pump out emissions to raise their peak level.
However the White House claim that the climate deal with China is a step to achieving the "deep decarbonization" of the global economy is delusory for another reason: It is far too costly.
Since Copenhagen, the principal motivation of Western leaders has not been to reach an effective agreement, but to justify their expensive renewable-energy programs. In the U.S., these have damaged America's energy-cost advantage, which is one of the few pro-growth factors in the anemic Obama recovery.
For the developing world, however, the climate negotiations have always been about how much money they get. From the outset, the talks were predicated on massive aid transfers from north to south. Climate became the most potent bargaining chip in a decades-old demand for aid to allegedly avoid permanent Third World impoverishment.
Defying the assumptions about permanent impoverishment, the growth of the developing world has been spectacular. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reckons that in 2010 developing nations' share of world GDP was 49%, up from 40% in 2000, and is projected to reach 57% in 2030.
This means more countries generating more carbon emissions. It also means that Obama-style deep decarbonization of the global economy would require that developed countries pay twice over -- once to decarbonize their own economies and a second time for developing ones.
That isn't going to happen. Even without China, the developing world is too large for the indebted, stagnating developed world to pay for global decarbonization.
If the West wants a fig-leaf climate agreement, however, it will have to at least promise to pay for one. At Copenhagen, developed nations pledged $100 billion a year of climate aid by 2020. The U.N. is having as little success raising money as it had in cutting emissions. So far it has recovered only $9.3 billion of one-time pledges.
Developing nations are already demanding early capitalization of the Green Climate Fund. A deal in Paris would make President Obama's recent pledge of $3 billion merely the opening round of escalating cash calls on U.S. taxpayers -- unless they vote against the party that promises to continue Mr. Obama's climate policies after his term expires.
For Republicans, this has the makings of a winning issue. In 2016 Mr. Obama will force Democrats to run, in effect, on a platform of fewer jobs, more-expensive energy and an indefinite commitment to paying billions of dollars of climate aid.
Another concern: The administration's climate plans involve a federal takeover of electricity generation, a critical segment of the economy. Kind of like the way ObamaCare took over health care. We can see how that's working out.

Full text:   With time ticking down on his second term, President Barack Obama has escalated his efforts to accomplish his policy goals without winning approval from Congress, a strategy that may produce results quickly but with the risk that they may be undone by lawmakers or a future president.
The latest example was Mr. Obama's policy, announced Thursday, of shielding more than four million illegal immigrants from deportation. Mr. Obama also has announced an aggressive climate deal with China, presided over an Environmental Protection Agency plan to order carbon-emission cuts at power plants and pursued nuclear negotiations with Iran.
Moreover, the White House has been exploring options intended to allow the president to close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay without Congress's approval.
The president long has promised to press ahead on his agenda with or without lawmakers' support, but the new actions are far more sweeping in scope than the moves he made earlier this year to, for example, raise the minimum wage for federal contractors.
With prospects uncertain for passing major legislation in the new, Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Obama has begun to build a second-term legacy that is likely to be defined in large part by unilateral action.
The strategy, however, comes with risks. Republican lawmakers have raised the specter of trying to undo the president's actions, and a future president potentially could reverse some of Mr. Obama's moves on immigration and climate change.
More immediately, the president's decision to sidestep lawmakers could diminish the chances of forging agreements with Republican leaders on other issues.
GOP lawmakers warned that Mr. Obama would "poison the well" by acting unilaterally on immigration.
"We've stopped having a constitutional system of checks and balances that's protected our liberty," Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said Sunday on Fox. "It's the power of a monarch or an emperor." He suggested that Republicans in the Senate respond to the president's actions on immigration by blocking his nominees.
In an interview that aired Sunday on ABC, Mr. Obama said: "What the American people expect is that if we disagree on one thing . . . then we work on everything else."
Suggesting that the legislative process wasn't at an end, some Republicans said the party should respond to Mr. Obama by taking the reins on policy and passing GOP-sponsored immigration bills, though it remained unclear what policy the party would put forward and whether Mr. Obama would sign on.
"It's incumbent on Republicans to come up with our own agenda, a positive, constructive agenda," said Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas) on CBS on Sunday.
Mr. Obama said in the interview that both Republican and Democratic presidents have taken similar executive actions. "Take a look at the track records of the modern presidency; I've actually been very restrained."
The first two years of Mr. Obama's second term yielded few legislative victories and little progress on the White House's top goals, such as raising the minimum wage and enacting comprehensive immigration legislation. Mr. Obama largely was sidelined during this fall's campaigns, and Republicans cast Democratic defeats in the midterm elections as a rejection of the president's policies.
The White House has resolved to push forward on Mr. Obama's agenda during the remaining two years.
"He does feel the pressure of time," Dan Pfeiffer, an Obama senior adviser, said Friday at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.
On both immigration and climate change, the president tried but failed to work with Congress to pass legislation before acting on his own. In addition to striking a deal with China to cut carbon pollution, Mr. Obama has laid out aggressive limits on power-plant emissions, another unilateral move that could stand as one of the more far-reaching actions of the second term.
White House officials also see a range of opportunities to define the president's second term in the foreign-policy realm.
The Obama administration has continued to press for an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program, despite skepticism in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have suggested that they would move to impose more sanctions on Iran if they aren't comfortable with a deal. Mr. Obama said in the ABC interview that he remained confident that if an agreement is reached, he could convince Congress it is the right thing to do.
While the president has said he wants to work with Congress, he and his advisers recently have struck a more defiant tone about Mr. Obama's powers to act on his own. Mr. Obama has said he has an answer for lawmakers who question his authority on immigration: "Nobody is stopping them from passing a bill."
Such statements have fanned discord between the White House and the GOP. But on Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) placed blame on both his party and the president, saying "shame on us as Republicans" for failing to pass legislation to overhaul the immigration system. "My party has failed," he said on CNN. "This president has failed miserably, and he's made it worse."

Full text:   NEW DELHI -- A new pact between the U.S. and China to tackle greenhouse-gas emissions has raised the question: Could India be next to set targets? After all, the two most populous countries in the world have long acted together in climate-change talks.
Indian officials say, however, that Beijing's deal has only highlighted the vast gap between a surging China and an India struggling to catch up. India appears unwilling to take steps that could burden its economy as it strives to build modern manufacturing industries.
Beijing and New Delhi used to join forces to stave off pressure from developed nations to curb emissions, arguing that high carbon-dioxide levels are a problem that now-wealthy, industrialized nations created over many years and not something developing countries should be expected to solve.
Last week, China agreed for the first time to stop increases in its emissions by around 2030, signaling a greater willingness to cooperate with the U.S. and the European Union. For its part, the U.S. agreed to cut emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.
Some in the West argued the agreement would put pressure on India, the world's third-largest emitter after China and the U.S., to make a similar pledge in climate negotiations that start next month, and which are expected to culminate at a major conference in Paris next year.
Instead, Indian officials and experts say, New Delhi is likely to highlight its vast differences with China, using the social, economic and emissions disparities as a bargaining chip in presenting its position.
"India's emissions are four times lower than China's," a senior official in India's Environment Ministry said. "If America is OK with the 2030 date for China, we can think about 2050 or even after that."
In the last decade, China's emissions have risen sharply both in absolute and per capita terms, reflecting rapid growth in its manufacturing economy and creating a developmental gulf with India. For example, 99.8% of China's population has access to electricity, while in India the rate is 75%, according to the World Bank.
India's per capita carbon emissions are around 1.9 tons a year, compared with China's 7.2 tons per person. The world average is 5 tons per person.
The ministry official said India's position in climate talks would be guided by the principle of "common but differentiated responsibility." Unlike China, the official said, India still needed to electrify millions of homes, build basic infrastructure and drive rapid economic growth to alleviate poverty.
An Indian climate-policy adviser said it was Western countries that had lumped India and China together by devising a category of big emitters so that they could "impose on these fast-growing countries obligations that are similarly binding" as those applicable to developed countries.
"China has reached a certain stage of development," the climate adviser said. "The time will come when India reaches that stage too, but that time is not now."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top aide for the Group of 20 summit held in Australia this past weekend was quoted as saying India had long suffered by being bracketed with China.
"On most social and economic indicators, China is way ahead of India," Suresh Prabhu told the newspaper Indian Express. "But because they have allied so closely at the negotiations, India and China are seen as together."
India's environment minister, Prakash Javdekar, said in a televised interview that Mr. Prabhu's comments represented his opinion and that India was still in the process of discussing its policy and negotiating stance.
Experts say India may extend its pledge to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each unit of gross domestic product, and to increase the use of renewable energy, which is among Mr. Modi's major priorities.

Full text:   BRISBANE, Australia -- The crisis in Ukraine cast a shadow over an international summit here, with Russian President Vladimir Putin leaving early after facing rebuke from fellow leaders over Moscow's role in the fighting.
Mr. Putin, the first leader to depart the weekend summit, cited the long flight home from Australia as the reason for his early exit and not the frosty reception he received from many counterparts -- including Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who told Mr. Putin to "get out of Ukraine." He didn't stay for the release of the Group of 20 industrial and developing nations' closing statement, which outlined over 800 economic commitments by individual countries, including a broad agreement for new carbon-reduction targets.
President Barack Obama, who said he held "businesslike and blunt" talks with Mr. Putin on the sidelines of the meeting, said Russia would remain in economic isolation while it continued to violate international law by providing heavy arms to separatists in Ukraine.
"We would prefer a Russia that is fully integrated with the global economy. But we are also very firm on the need to hold core international principles," Mr. Obama said. "And one of those principles is that you don't invade other countries or finance proxies and support them in ways that break up the country. At this point the sanctions that we have in place are biting plenty good," the president said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blamed Moscow for the apparent collapse of a cease-fire agreement between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels in the country's east.
Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin spoke at length on the sidelines of the G-20. Over the weekend, Moscow expelled a German diplomat in retaliation for Germany's ordering the departure of a suspected Russian spy -- an unusually aggressive response by Russia. Der Spiegel magazine, which reported the news Saturday, said that in comparable past cases Russia hadn't responded with an expulsion.
In the summit's closing statement Sunday, world leaders agreed on measures to lift global growth by 2.1% over five years through a mix of reforms and new infrastructure projects.
Climate change also made its way into the document after European and U.S. leaders lined up against resource-rich Australia and Saudi Arabia to force the issue onto the agenda. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott once described climate-change science as "crap," and his conservative government in July repealed a pioneering tax on carbon emissions, hampering international efforts to coordinate on global warming.
The wording of the G-20 document, while not going as far on climate change as European and U.S. backers hoped, called for nations to unveil new carbon-reduction targets ahead of a global climate summit in Paris next year.
Major economies will also be encouraged to contribute to an international Green Climate Fund to help developing nations deal with climate change. Japan on Sunday pledged $1.5 billion to the climate fund, which has already received pledges from the U.S., Germany, France and other donors and aims to raise $10 billion.
The climate talks gained momentum after Mr. Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Wednesday unveiled substantial new commitments to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, with China agreeing for the first time to stop increases in carbon-dioxide emissions by around 2030 or earlier.
The reforms outlined in the document will be overseen by the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. World leaders also agreed to tackle problems in the international tax system that have led to tax evasion by multinational companies, including the introduction of a common reporting standard on tax information to curb use of tax havens.
In another breakthrough, the Chinese president dropped opposition to anticorruption measures designed to reveal the true ownership of shell companies.
European countries had expected censure from other leaders over anemic growth in the 18-country eurozone, with Europe struggling to escape its six-year slump. The bloc's gross domestic product remains more than 2% below pre-2008 global financial crisis levels at a time when growth in other advanced economies such as the U.S. and the U.K. is picking up.
But the G-20 acknowledged "modest" recovery in the euro area, with negotiators agreeing to moderate earlier plans to describe it as "weak and fragile."
Leaders also pledged to reduce the global gender gap in job participation rates by 25% by 2025, as well as look at ways to tackle youth unemployment.

Full text:   BRISBANE, Australia -- In the days since the U.S. midterm elections, President Barack Obama has begun grooming his legacy in ways that place him on a collision course not just with Republicans in Congress, but with his own Democratic Party.
During a series of global summits in China, Myanmar and Australia over the past week, Mr. Obama netted several foreign policy victories and vowed to use the momentum to pursue his domestic agenda in Washington.
"From trade to climate change to the fight against Ebola, this was a strong week for American leadership," Mr. Obama said Sunday during a news conference in Australia. "I intend to build on that momentum when I return home."
He vowed to take executive action that could give legal status to millions of immigrants in the U.S. without an act of Congress, and he put his thumb on the scale in favor of liberal activists and Silicon Valley companies in a high-stakes debate over federally regulating the Internet.
All of it appears designed to demonstrate his continued relevancy on the heels of an election that solidified his status as a politically weakened lame duck.
But some of his overseas victories are likely to stir political antipathy at home. The historic climate-change deal with China, in which the U.S. and China both committed to future carbon reductions, could stoke Republican ire. Democrats, meanwhile, are likely to be uncomfortable with the aggressive trade agenda Mr. Obama outlined.
Several of Mr. Obama's predecessors faced a similar dynamic at this point in their second terms, and also turned to foreign policy as a source of renewal for their latter years.
"A lot can happen on foreign policy even for a lame-duck president and even for a president that faces difficult congressional circumstances," said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University.
President Ronald Reagan signed a landmark nuclear arms treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 after his party lost control of the Senate in midterm elections, prompting threats from Republicans not to ratify it because they didn't trust Mr. Gorbachev. The treaty later was approved.
President George W. Bush ordered a troop surge in Iraq after his party lost in the 2006 midterms, drawing criticism from Democrats and Republicans who argued that voters had sent the message that they wanted fewer, not more, troops in Iraq.
Messrs. Reagan and Bush responded to the criticism with different approaches, said Mr. Zelizer. "Reagan's playbook was to win the war of public opinion," he said, while Mr. Bush's model was riskier: "Move forward with what you want to do and hope everyone follows."
A senior Obama administration official said the president will work to win public support for his climate change and trade policies. His approach, the official said, will be more in line with that of Mr. Reagan's use of the bully pulpit than with Mr. Bush's approach.
Even after notching a measure of foreign policy success, Mr. Obama faces challenges in converting that to domestic advances. He also faces a credibility problem in Asia, analysts say, after promising many times that he would dedicate significant presidential attention to the region only to be drawn into crises in the Middle East and Ukraine.
"People pay very close attention to whether we show up and whether we follow through," said Eric Altbach, who was deputy assistant U.S. trade representative for China Affairs under Presidents Bush and Obama.
Mr. Altbach, who is a senior vice president at the Albright Stonebridge Group, noted China's increasingly robust effort to make financial and infrastructure investments in the same countries Mr. Obama has cultivated in the region. "There is competition," he said. "The Chinese are there and they're going to continue to be there."
Also unclear is how Mr. Obama will ensure the new show of U.S.-China cooperation doesn't unravel, given Beijing's increasing assertiveness. At the end of the gathering of Group of 20 leaders in Brisbane on Sunday, leaders announced that China will host the summit in 2016.
An added complication is that Mr. Obama's foreign policy landscape is littered with global problems: in Ukraine, Iraq, Syria and the Ebola crisis in Africa.
When Mr. Obama departed Australia, he hadn't been in the air for more three hours before Islamic State militants released a new video showing the beheading of another American. And Mr. Obama, during Sunday's news conference, appeared to leave open a possibility of deploying U.S. combat units in Iraq and Syria, lining up more closely with his top military advisers.
The question facing Mr. Obama when he returns to Washington is how he will use his overseas successes to influence his new political dynamic at home, said Stephen Hadley, a former national security adviser under President George W. Bush, including whether to pursue an agenda that leans more on unilateral power or try to get more enduring things done with Republicans, such as trade efforts.

Abstract: The display of cooperation during President Barack Obama's visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping was the product of months of low-key meetings between midlevel bureaucrats who were tasked with setting up a new chapter in U.S.-China relations, according to senior U.S. and defense officials. After a Chinese fighter jet flew within 100 feet of a U.S. surveillance plane in August, Mr. Obama's national-security adviser, Susan Rice, received a personal assurance from Gen. Fan Changlong, the vice chairman of China's powerful Central Military Commission, during a meeting in Beijing that it wouldn't happen again, U.S. officials said.

Full text:   The display of cooperation during President Barack Obama's visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping was the product of months of low-key meetings between midlevel bureaucrats who were tasked with setting up a new chapter in U.S.-China relations, according to senior U.S. and defense officials.
The apparent reset in their relationship -- what Mr. Xi described as a "new model" for U.S.-China relations -- showed a rare moment of accord between two countries that just three months ago swapped warnings after close encounter between military aircraft. Still, the two remain far from consensus on key aspects of trade and military deals announced Tuesday, and their relationship was immediately put to the test as Mr. Obama traveled Wednesday from Beijing to neighboring Myanmar, where U.S. and Chinese strategic interests collide.
At its core, the blueprint for diplomatic progress between the world's two largest economies -- forged by Messrs. Obama and Xi over the past 18 months -- hinges on elevating areas of potential agreement, while showing restraint in areas of deep concern.
"It's a process of setting boundaries and then gradually narrowing in on where you can make progress," a senior Obama administration official said.
That has meant focusing on carbon emissions, military cooperation, travel and trade, while de-emphasizing for now concerns with Beijing's Communist government and its policies toward human rights, its Tibetan minority, protests in Hong Kong and competing territorial claims in the South and East China seas.
The approach carries obvious risks. U.S. officials concede that despite Mr. Xi's warming to collaboration on issues China has eschewed for years, he could shift course.
Negotiations between the two sides had limits, too, despite the dramatic show of accord. Officials from both sides tried but couldn't reach a consensus on the issue of solar tariffs, and the military cooperation pact remains unfinished.
"One thing is certain: China and the U.S. can only agree in easier areas," said Shi Yinhong, an expert on U.S.-China relations at Beijing's Renmin University.
"Every summit can improve the relationship, or the atmosphere, for weeks or even months," he said. "After that, the relationship still has its vicissitudes."
After a Chinese fighter jet flew within 100 feet of a U.S. surveillance plane in August, Mr. Obama's national-security adviser, Susan Rice, received a personal assurance from Gen. Fan Changlong, the vice chairman of China's powerful Central Military Commission, during a meeting in Beijing that it wouldn't happen again, U.S. officials said.
China's defense ministry has said that its pilot flew safely and asked the U.S. to cease such operations. Gen. Fan couldn't be reached to comment.
Chinese and American military officials entered eight weeks of intense negotiations, and defense officials said there were five weeklong meetings to work on the content of the deals. One agreement commits both sides to notifying the other of exercises, major reports and military shifts; a second covers rules of behavior for ship operators. However, the military negotiations weren't concluded. Still outstanding are agreements covering conduct in the air and between the ground and air, officials said.
The two sides also failed to reach accord on the type of military activity allowed in maritime areas designated as exclusive economic zones, defense officials said. The U.S. maintains military exercises are permitted; China disagrees.
Senior U.S. officials said the groundwork for Wednesday's announcements was laid in June 2013 at Messrs. Obama and Xi's meeting at the sprawling California resort in Sunnylands. There, Mr. Xi showed an openness to deal on climate and military concerns, officials said.
A critical moment came in March this year, when Mr. Obama sent Mr. Xi a letter outlining an agenda for U.S.-China relations. The letter came on the heels of Secretary of State John Kerry's trip to China, where he raised the idea of a joint climate agreement.
When Messrs. Obama and Xi met in The Hague in March on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit, the U.S. president raised the climate-change issue, U.S. officials said, but his Chinese counterpart showed little interest.
Ms. Rice let Mr. Xi know during a trip to Beijing in early September that the U.S. wanted a climate deal. Two weeks later, the White House got a breakthrough. China wanted a meeting between Premier Li Keqiang and Mr. Obama at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Mr. Li had a message from Mr. Xi on climate change, U.S. officials said, telling Mr. Obama: "Let's get this done."
The climate pledges promise emissions reductions far in the future that disappointed some environmentalists, and some critics say it could be difficult to enforce the agreements in future governments. Still, most experts said working with China, the biggest carbon-dioxide emitter, on climate change issues strengthens the hand of the Obama administration.
Underlying tensions between the U.S. and China could be tested in Myanmar, where Mr. Obama and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang are both attending the East Asian summit this week.

Full text:   President Barack Obama's plan to curb greenhouse-gas emissions alongside China sets the stage for lengthy confrontations with other nations resistant to making cuts, Republicans who want to roll back regulations and environmentalists pushing for bigger reductions.
In a surprise announcement Wednesday in Beijing, Mr. Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, released their targets for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions more than a decade down the road. Under the proposals, Chinese emissions of carbon dioxide would peak by around 2030, while the U.S. would cut emissions by more than a quarter between 2005 and 2025.
Groups concerned about climate change praised the White House for bringing China into the fold of industrialized economies eager to curb emissions. China's move to lower reliance on fossil fuels to 80% of its energy raised the prospect of a huge expansion in the market for alternative energy.
"It's a game-changer on two fronts: It's a diplomatic breakthrough and a huge boost to the clean-energy market," said Fred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defense Fund. "Those two fronts are more important than the numbers."
The Obama administration's move helps blunt the frequent Republican argument that the U.S. shouldn't shoot itself in the foot by making economically painful emissions cuts when China is unlikely to stop increasing its greenhouse-gas output.
But congressional Republicans, soon to have a majority in the Senate in addition to the House, pledged to do everything they could to undo the Obama administration's emissions targets for power plants. The U.S.-China announcement is a "nonbinding charade," said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.), the leading Republican critic on climate policy. Mr. Inhofe, the likely incoming chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee who has long disputed the science on global warming, vowed to use his perch in Congress to restrain the administration on energy and climate policy.
A senior administration official said GOP gains in Congress mean Mr. Obama likely won't get legislative help in achieving the goals but that Republicans are unlikely to be able to stop executive orders and environmental regulations coming from the White House.
Some environmental groups said China's pledge won't allow its emissions to peak soon enough, while the U.S. pledge was seen as no more ambitious than its previous trajectory of regulations and targets.
"We need a peak emissions goal from China that's five or 10 years sooner than what they proposed," said Kyle Ash, senior legislative director at Greenpeace in Washington. Mr. Ash said about half of the emissions reductions the U.S. pledged have already been made.
Experts said China's move to work on climate policy with the U.S. -- which in turn is working with the European Union -- won't necessarily lead to cuts in the other countries set to begin negotiating a 2015 climate framework starting next month in Lima, Peru. Some major emerging markets want the U.S. and European countries, previously the biggest emitters, to make the bulk of the painful reductions that could crimp economic growth.
After his Beijing visit, Mr. Obama is set to meet a conservative Australian government that repealed the country's carbon tax. Meanwhile, India and oil exporters including Russia and Venezuela appear unlikely to offer deep emissions cuts through the international talks.
Australia's move to remove a previous administration's price on carbon shows another obstacle the Obama administration faces in planning long-term emissions targets that could be reversed by the next president or Congress.
Republican leaders in Congress immediately renewed their calls to reverse rules at the Environmental Protection Agency that would cut emissions from power plants.
"I was particularly distressed by the deal . . . which as I read the agreement, requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years while these carbon regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states around the country," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) at a meeting on Capitol Hill with the incoming class of senators.
Longer term, Republicans may be able to influence global climate negotiations by highlighting the uncertainty of the proposed EPA rules, such as the possibility they may get struck down in legal battles, and the likelihood that a Republican president after the 2016 election would reverse course.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Billionaire activist Tom Steyer's drive to make climate change a winning issue in this year's midterm election fell short as several Democratic candidates he supported lost amid the Republican sweep in Congress and state races.
NextGen Climate Action Committee, the PAC Mr. Steyer created in 2013 to press climate change as a political issue, spent $65 million in the current election cycle, with the bulk of the money going to support four Senate races and three governor races where there was a distinction between candidates on climate and energy issues. Of that money, all but about $5.4 million came from Mr. Steyer's pocket.
Democrats lost in four out of the seven races Mr. Steyer supported, including the Colorado Senate race, where Democratic Sen. Mark Udall lost to Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, and the Florida governor's race, where former Democratic Gov. Charlie Crist failed to unseat Republican Gov. Rick Scott.
Mr. Steyer's PAC spent nearly $17 million in Florida and more than $8.5 million in Colorado, said NextGen spokesman Bobby Whithorne.
Republicans painted Mr. Steyer's campaign as a failure. Some political experts said his efforts fell short because the Democratic Party faced a tough election year, rather than because of the specific campaign he mounted.
"This was such a bad year for Democrats that a 3 of 7 record isn't as awful as it seems," said Larry Sabato, political science professor at the University of Virginia. "No one, no matter how wealthy, is going to dominate American elections. There are too many checks and balances."
Mr. Steyer's group and other environmental organizations pointed to wins in three races they supported: Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's narrow victory in New Hampshire over Scott Brown; Democrat Gary Peters's Senate win in Michigan over Terri Lynn Land; and Democrat Tom Wolf's defeat of Pennsylvania GOP Gov. Tom Corbett.
NextGen's top political strategist, Chris Lehane, acknowledged the "headwinds" they faced. He said Mr. Steyer didn't waste his money and is taking a longer-term view of his efforts, which he said will ramp up even more for the 2016 presidential election cycle. Mr. Lehane cited poor turnout and voter focus on foreign policy and Ebola as two of the challenges that the climate change campaign encountered.
NextGen's contributions represented the bulk of the environmental community's record spending this election cycle. Combined with the nearly $30 million the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund spent, environmental groups contributed more than $90 million this cycle, which is more than five times what they spent in 2012, a presidential election year.
Among the other races Mr. Steyer poured money into that didn't go his way: Republican Joni Ernst beat Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley in the Iowa Senate race and incumbent Republican Maine Gov. Paul LePage fended off a challenge by Democrat Mike Michaud.
Mr. Steyer, who became wealthy as founder of Farallon Capital Management, a California-based, hedge-fund company, left the private sector in 2013 to focus on politics and philanthropy. He has emerged as the Democratic Party's closest counterpart to the conservative billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, who have funded many conservative causes, such as the tea-party group Americans for Prosperity.
