Experts: Climate Change Fueling Australian Fires,"Australia may be getting a glimpse of its globally warmed future. Experts agreed Tuesday that no one drought, flood or wildfire can be attributed to global warming, but they stressed that the eucalyptus forests and farms of southeastern Australia are becoming warmer, drier and more prone to fire as the planet heats up. Some say rising temperatures are making Australia's climate more extreme at the edges. Snow will disappear from the few mountains that still have it, the cyclones that batter the topical north could get more powerful and the conditions that set the southeast ablaze could become common. ""The terrible events of the past couple of weeks are, without doubt, partly the result of global warming and the greenhouse effect,"" said Neville Nicholls, an expert on climate change and wildfires at Australia's Monash University. Global warming cannot be blamed for starting the hundreds of recent fires -- tens of thousands of such blazes erupt across Australia every fire season, from October to March -- but the effects of climate change exacerbated their ferocity, Nicholls said. First, a decade of drought has made Australia's wild forests -- known as ""the bush"" -- tinder dry. Second, a sustained and record-breaking heat wave settled over the region. Lastly, record-smashing temperatures on Saturday topped 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees Celsius) and combined with winds up to 60 mph (100 kph) to whip fires into furnace-like intensity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Nobel Prize-winning team of scientists responsible for advising the United Nations about global warming, says the rise in the atmosphere's temperature could cause water shortages, crop failures, more deaths from heat waves and more severe storms around the world. In Australia, it means more droughts in the dry south and more flooding in the tropical north. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef system rich in sealife and sensitive to small temperature changes, is in trouble. The Australian government's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization concluded in 2007 that the country's average temperature will rise about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 C) by 2030 and up to 9 degrees F (5 C) by 2070 if greenhouse emissions are not curbed. An island large enough to be counted as a continent, Australia's climate varies with its landscape. It is home to dry shifting dunes in the desert ""red heart,"" misty Riesling grape-clad hills, and lush monsoonal rain forest and mangrove swamps. Among the panel's forecasts: Climate change would likely mean less rain, but rainfalls that did occur would be more intense. Drought in the south -- the wheat-, sheep- and cattle-growing food belt -- would be more frequent and fires more common. Cyclones that are a regular feature of the summer months in the north would hit harder. Even as southeastern Australia sweltered and the fires raged this week, some 60 percent of northeastern Queensland state was covered by floodwaters after weeks of drenching rain from a dying offshore cyclone. Three thousand homes were damaged. No deaths were reported. While scientists cautioned against attributing the wildfires themselves to global warming, they said changing conditions from rising temperatures are having an impact. ""Australia -- and particularly the southeastern corner of Australia -- is fire prone, so a fire-prone environment coupled with a warmer and drier climate in the future is likely to increase the incidence of this kind of event,"" said Mark Adams, a wildfire expert at the University of Sydney. ""But statistically, we won't be able to prove it for many decades."" Adams said Australia's peculiar ecosystems are particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. An increase of just one or two degrees would cause snow in Australia to disappear, and its Great Barrier Reef and rainforests are particularly sensitive to warming, he said. ""But I don't think that on the whole Australia is more susceptible than many other -- or indeed any other -- continent,"" Adams said. Penny Whetton, leader of the climate change research group at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, also cautioned against tying the fires too closely to global warming. ""Due to changes in the climate, the high risk of fires has increased and will increase,"" she said. ""But that is different than saying climate change caused these fires. It's difficult to relate climate change to an individual weather event."" For conservationists, the dry conditions and the devastating fires bolster their campaign to push the world's governments to move faster on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. ""It's a sobering reminder of the need for this nation and the whole world to act and to put at a priority our need to tackle climate change in a way that politicians have simply been unable or refused to do in past decades,"" said Sen. Bob Brown of the left-leaning Australian Greens party.",10/02/2009,https://www.foxnews.com/science/experts-climate-change-fueling-australian-fires
Climate-Change Talks Move Into Next Phase,"Negotiators from 181 countries began work on the first draft of a new global warming treaty Monday, calling it a good beginning despite complaints it was unbalanced and incomplete. Delegates have been brainstorming and arguing over principles for 18 months. The draft includes conflicting proposals pointing to tough negotiations ahead. Among dozens of unresolved issues was whether developing economies must commit to control their greenhouse gas emissions and whether their commitments would be legally binding or voluntary. The U.S. delegation wanted the text to put all countries on a more equal footing, requiring every country to take action to fight climate change according to its capability. Developing countries said the draft failed to take adequate account of their proposals. U.N. scientists warn that unrestrained emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly from fossil fuels from heavy industry and vehicles, will lead to changes in temperatures and rainfall, putting millions of people at risk of more severe droughts and storms, rising sea levels that could flood coastlines and sink entire islands, cause the extinction of plant and animal species and increase health hazards for man. Michael Zammit Cutajar, who compiled the draft from dozens of position papers submitted by countries, acknowledged it was ""complex"" and ""messy,"" but said he was pleased with the initial reception. The draft ""represents a significant new step in the talks,"" said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The documents present a range of options on core issues: how much industrial countries must cut carbon emissions; how to raise the tens of billions of dollars needed annually for developing countries to adapt to climate change like shifts in agriculture or coastal erosion due to rising sea levels; and how to compensate tropical countries for slowing the destruction of the rain forests, either from an established fund or from selling credits on the carbon market for avoiding deforestation. Countries were expected to make more additions to the draft before beginning the arduous task of cutting deals, weeding out proposals and sharpening the text into a consensus document. Four more negotiating conferences were scheduled for this year, culminating in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December when the agreement is due to be adopted. But the hard political decisions were likely to be taken at top-level meetings outside the U.N. framework. Heads of state are due to confer on climate issues at least four times before the Copenhagen conference. ""The signals have to come from above to start the process,"" said environmental activist Jennifer Morgan of the E3G think tank. Developing countries with rapidly expanding economies like China and India have pledged to curb the growth of their carbon emissions, in exchange for funding and green technologies from the industrial countries. They say the level of funding would determine the commitments they would take on in the Copenhagen agreement. The European Union indicated it was unlikely to come up with specific figures to contribute to a climate change fund before Copenhagen. De Boer said the developing countries needed clarity on the financial support they will get, ""so I hope that much of the discussion will take place as early as possible before Copenhagen,"" The Copenhagen agreement would succeed and expand on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which required 37 industrial nations to cut emissions blamed for global warming by a total of 5 percent by 1990, but which made no obligations on any other country. The United States rejected the Kyoto deal, partly because it excluded developing economies. Reversing that policy, the administration of President Barack Obama has pledged to take a leading role in crafting the next climate deal.",03/06/2009,https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-talks-move-into-next-phase.amp
U.N.: Nature Best at Handling Climate Change,"AMSTERDAM -- Nature's way is best for controlling the gases responsible for climate change, the U.N. Environment Program said in a report Friday. The report said better management of forests, more careful agricultural practices and the restoration of peatlands could soak up significant amounts of carbon dioxide, the most common of the gases blamed for global warming. ""We need to move toward a comprehensive policy framework for addressing ecosystems,"" said co-author Barney Dickson, releasing the report at the U.N. climate negotiations in Bonn, Germany. The event was Webcast worldwide. Millions of dollars are being invested in research on capturing and burying carbon emissions from power stations, but investing in ecosystems could achieve cheaper results, the report said. It also would have the added effects of preserving biodiversity, improving water supplies and boosting livelihoods. Halving deforestation by mid-century and maintaining that lower rate for another 50 years would save the equivalent of five years of carbon emissions at the current level, said Dickson, the agency's head of climate change and biodiversity. The loss of peatlands, mainly drained for palm oil and pulp wood plantations in Southeast Asia, contributes 8 percent of global carbon emissions. China could capture about 5 percent of its carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels by returning straw to croplands, it said. Agriculture has the largest potential for storing carbon if farmers use better techniques, such as avoiding turning over the soil and using natural compost and manure rather than chemical fertilizers, it said.",05/06/2009,https://www.foxnews.com/science/u-n-nature-best-at-handling-climate-change.amp
Critics Decry 'One-Sided' Media Coverage of Climate Change Debate,"The mainstream media are abandoning objective reporting and acting as full-time advocates for measures to combat global warming, some media watchdogs say, accusing them of pushing for a sweeping international agreement on climate change. As President Obama prepares to travel to Copenhagen, Denmark, to attend an international conference on climate change scheduled for Dec. 7-18, the media are already ""out in front of the administration"" in pushing a liberal agenda, says Dan Gainor, vice president for business and culture at the Media Research Center. ""There's no more clear religion in the mainstream media than the religion of global warming,"" Gainor told FoxNews.com. ""It's gone from being a situation where there was some debate, to now there's almost none,"" Gainor said. ""You can't say anything that even raises the question that there might not be real science here. That's not what journalism is supposed to do."" Obama, who will arrive in Copenhagen on Dec. 18, plans to unveil a 10-year plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 17 percent below 2005 levels. The president will also take up a 181-page draft treaty proposed by the United Nations that calls on representatives from 170 countries to establish sweeping measures to reduce emissions and combat climate change. And the mainstream media are hopping aboard the bandwagon, critics say. ""The media already accept the theory of manmade global warming, so their modus operandi will be -- let's come to an agreement on reducing energy, either through taxes or restrictions,"" Cliff Kincaid, editor for Accuracy in Media, told FoxNews.com. ""The coverage is so one-sided,"" Kincaid said. ""It seems to me the media have an obligation to read the (treaty) and tell us what's in it. ""Many in the media don't want to hear that. If they would bother to read the treaty, they would report that there are numerous proposals for global taxes. I don't think those are going to go over too well with the American people."" But other media watchdogs say journalists are not biased on the issue. They say they are simply representing the facts offered by the majority of the scientific community. ""Journalists are not scientists -- they do not have an extensive background in cutting-edge science,"" says Jim Naureckas, editor of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. ""It seems to me that you have to defer to scientists on scientific questions, and get their take on what's going on,"" Naureckas told FoxNews.com. ""You're dealing with very serious issues here. If one accepts that scientists generally know what they're talking about on the topics they're studying -- then you're dealing with an oncoming global catastrophe. ""It's clear there is a scientific consensus on global warming that is quite compelling,"" Naureckas said. But critics say the mainstream journalists are ignoring the other side. Gainor pointed to what he said was the media's inattention to the scandal dubbed ""Climate-gate,"" a series of e-mails made public recently after computer hackers obtained messages from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in England. In some of the e-mails, scientists appear to discuss hiding or deleting data that contradicts global warming claims. Some explicitly admit to hiding data that would indicate a global cooling trend rather than a rise in global temperatures. ""This is a story of global importance, involving potentially enormous scandal. Other than a little bit of print coverage, the mainstream media has made no comment,"" Gainor told FoxNews.com. ""I would like a genuine, legitimate, scientific inquiry before we spend billions or trillions of dollars,"" Gainor said. Dan Amundson, research director for the nonpartisan Center for Media and Public Affairs, says the media have given less coverage to the climate change debate than other heated issues such as health care reform or foreign policy. But he says there seems to be a pattern of support for ""some type of international agreement and taking concrete steps about carbon dioxide."" ""While global warming critics get more airtime and coverage than environmentalists would like, they are a small part of coverage over the years,"" Amundson said. A majority of Americans believe that climate change is occurring and that it is a serious problem, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll from Nov. 25, 2009.",01/12/2009,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-decry-one-sided-media-coverage-of-climate-change-debate
New List Highlights Animals Threatened by Climate Change,"The Wildlife Conservation Society released a list this week of some ""unsung"" victims of climate change, including some species that are just now beginning to feel the effects of Earth's worsening climate situation. The issue is especially timely given that world leaders are currently meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, to brainstorm how to fight global warming. And the United Nations plans to launch the ""International Year of Biodiversity"" in 2010 to highlight the ongoing loss of flora and fauna species worldwide. SLIDESHOW: Animals threatened by climate change Some of the threatened animals are: Flamingoes: This group is strongly affected by declines in the availability and quality of wetland habitat in the Caribbean, South America, Asia and Africa, where flamingoes live. Hawksbill turtles: The biology of these ocean-dwelling reptiles depends strongly on the temperature of their environment. As oceans become warmer, more female than male turtles are born, skewing the sex ratio and endangering the species' ability to reproduce. Magellanic penguins: These penguins have been laying their eggs later in the season and swimming farther away from their nests in search of food, scientists have found. The largest breeding colony of this species in Patagonia has declined more than 20 percent in the last 20 years. Musk oxen: This wooly species lives in the harsh Arctic Tundra, where more and more grizzly bears are migrating as it becomes warmer and more hospitable to them. The bears, in turn, prey on the oxen. White-lipped peccaries: This mammal species living in Central and South America depends on shallow ponds to survive during the regions dry season. Climate change is diminishing these water sources, which in turn causes the population of peccaries to decline. Other animals on the list are: Bicknell's thrush, a bird species that breeds and nests high on mountains in northeastern North America; Chiru, also known as the Tibetan antelope, which dwells on the high plateau of Tibet; Irrawaddy dolphin, native to Southeast Asia; Various primate species; Coral; Lemmings, small rodents that live near the Arctic; Buff-breasted sandpipers, or Arctic migratory birds; Numerous amphibian species; Lake trout; Bowhead whales, which live in polar conditions in the Arctic; Wolverines, which are mammals that live in cold climates around the Northern Hemisphere",08/12/2009,https://www.foxnews.com/science/new-list-highlights-animals-threatened-by-climate-change
Administration Proposes New Agency to Study Climate Change,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Monday proposed a new agency to study and report on the changing climate, which has drawn concern among many scientists in recent years. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Jane Lubchenco, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, announced NOAA will set up the new Climate Service to operate in tandem with NOAA's National Weather Service and National Ocean Service. ""Whether we like it or not, climate change represents a real threat,"" Locke said Monday at a news conference. Lubchenco added, ""Climate change is real, it's happening now."" She said climate information is vital to the wind power industry, coastal community planning, fishermen and fishery managers, farmers and public health officials. NOAA recently reported that the decade of 2000-2009 was the warmest on record worldwide; the previous warmest decade was the 1990s. Many atmospheric scientists believe that global warming is largely due to human actions, adding gases to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. Researchers and leaders from around the world met last month in Denmark to discuss ways to reduce climate-warming emissions, and a follow-up session is planned for later this year in Mexico. But a U.N. report that preceded the conference in Copenhagen has been widely disputed after much of the data in it was found to have been gathered unscientifically. ""More and more people are asking for more and more information about climate and how it's going to affect them,"" Lubchenco explained. So officials decided to combine climate operations into a single unit. Portions of the Weather Service that have been studying climate, as well as offices from some other NOAA agencies, will be transferred to the new NOAA Climate Service. The new agency will initially be led by Thomas Karl, director of the current National Climatic Data Center. The Climate Service will be headquartered in Washington and will have six regional directors across the country. Lubchenco also announced a new NOAA climate portal on the Internet to collect a vast array of climatic data from NOAA and other sources. It will be ""one-stop shopping into a world of climate information,"" she said. Creation of the Climate Service requires a series of steps, including congressional committee approval. But if all goes well, it should be finished by the end of the year, officials said. In recent years, a widespread private weather forecasting industry has grown up around the National Weather Service, and Lubchenco said she anticipates growth of private climate-related business around the new agency.

Global Warming Debate Heats Up in Wake of Record Snowstorms,"Scientists and politicians on both sides of the climate change debate have been pointing to the record-breaking snowstorms in the Mid-Atlantic states to promote their theories on the earth's changing temperatures -- and the debate is getting downright nasty. Joseph Romm, a climate change expert and former Energy Department official; Jeff Masters, a meteorologist who writes on the Weather Underground blog; and others argue that this winter's snowstorms are, counterintuitively, evidence of global warming and not cooling. ""It's absurd for the 'anti-science side' to say we're in a cooling trend when we're in an overall warming trend,"" says Romm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. ""Heavy snow is not evidence that climate science is false,"" he added, noting that ""the snow we've seen is entirely consistent with global warming theory."" But Patrick J. Michaels, senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute and state climatologist for Virginia for 27 years, disagrees. ""Global warming simply hasn't done a darned thing to Washington's snow,"" he wrote on National Review, adding that ""if you plot out year-to-year snow around here, you'll see no trend whatsoever through the entire history."" Politicians are jumping on the bandwagon, too. ""It's going to keep snowing in DC until Al Gore cries 'uncle,'"" tweeted Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. Global warming advocates feel under attack as skeptics use the record-setting snowstorms -- and the recent discoveries of errors in the U.N.'s climate science study, a growing scandal called climate-gate -- to question the theory that climate change is a manmade problem. Romm explains that cold weather doesn't cause snow. What brings the flakes down is a combination of cold and precipitation. And since warmer air holds more moisture, global warming and heavy snowfall can coexist, so long as temperatures keeping dipping below 32 degrees. Bill Nye, the Science Guy, agrees, going so far as to tell MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that scientists who doubt climate change's manmade origins are unpatriotic. ""If you want to get serious about it, these guys claiming that the snow in Washington disproves climate change are almost unpatriotic -- it's as if they're denying science,"" Nye said. And though the science debate heats up, unlike the weather, the snowstorms have set off even more questions: Why is the East Coast getting hit, while Vancouver needs to truck in snow for the Winter Olympics? Can we accurately link extreme weather with global warming? Not really, says meteorologist Jeff Masters of Weather Underground, an independent forecaster. ""You can't take regional events and link them to overall climate change,"" he said. ""There's a huge amount of natural variance."" But some skeptics say the science isn't that innocent, even though they acknowledge global warming as a measurable anomaly. ""As climate change critics, we're not denying an increase in temperature,"" says Dan Miller, publisher of the Heartland Institute, a group that favors free-market solutions to public policy problems. ""We're skeptical of the crisis level and the cause."" Miller says climate-change scientists have a conflict of interest, as many stand to receive ""a huge amount of money"" from the government to support continued research. ""There is no upper limit of money at stake,"" he warns. Conversely, Miller says his firm is impartial, having no financial investment in climate change; it would lose a mere 4 percent of its funding if it ends up on the wrong side of the debate. ""There's no money at stake for critics,"" he points out. Masters says in a perfect world he'd need ""200-300 years worth of records"" to accurately predict further climate change. But since that's not available, ""We're forced to make decisions on a limited data set."" Nevertheless, Masters feels the possible dangers of global warming outweigh the risks of remaining idle. ""We need to take action even in the face of inadequate data,"" he says. Miller disagrees, arguing that we should collectively return to the drawing board -- in light of all the controversy, confusion, and potential conflicts of interest -- before we draw any conclusions. ""The science isn't settled,"" he says. ""Yes, the climate has warmed -- that's not a hoax. But can't we go back and reconsider the science? Let's just step back and reconsider.""",13/02/2010,https://www.foxnews.com/science/global-warming-debate-heats-up-in-wake-of-record-snowstorms
Global Warming Skeptics Lambaste Plan to Increase Funding for Climate Change Research,"Global warming skeptics are agog that President Obama is seeking to dramatically increase federal funding for global warming research in the wake of the Climate-gate scandals that have emerged during the last three months. The federal budget for 2011 proposes $2.6 billion for the Global Change Research Program, a  21 percent boost over 2010. It will bring funding to a level higher than under any administration dating back to 1989 -- when global warming first attracted federal budget funds. In fact, critics note, overall climate funding is approximately as large as the entire federal government's budget was in 1932 -- $3.994 billion. (Additional money for climate science is apportioned to a number of federal agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.) Critics are lambasting the Obama administration, saying it remains unfazed by the revelations of Climate-gate: doctored research statistics by British environmental scientists, attempts to discredit skeptics of global warming science, and disclosures that the U.N.'s own Nobel-Prize-winning climate science research was based on faulty research about the Amazon rain forest and Himalayan ice caps. Some public policy experts are expressing outrage that the White House is seeking to boost global warming research funding. ""Spending more money on research does not necessarily lead to concrete results,"" Norm Rogers, a senior policy adviser at the Chicago think-tank The Heartland Institute, told FoxNews.com. He said tens of billions of dollars have been spent on climate research in the last 20 years, and there remains no consensus on the science. Another expert, Professor Don Easterbrook at Western Washington University's department of geology, said the federal money ""ought to be spent carrying out real research on the climate."" Easterbrook said most of the federal funds so far have been spent on what he terms ""political science,"" which aims to find a manmade cause of global warming when there are any number of ways to investigate the causes of temperature change. These are political motivations rather than purely scientific reasons, he said. ""This is a travesty,"" he told FoxNews.com. But other scientists applauded the proposed boost in federal money for climate research. ""Funding for neglected basic research in geophysics, climate, and allied sciences is welcome,"" said Dallas C. Kennedy, a physicist with a doctorate from Stanford University. Kennedy believes those fields have seen dwindling resources in recent years, and money spent on them will yield better science. The administration's proposed changes include the creation of a new federal agency that will serve as a clearinghouse for climate-change data and resources. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke explained the potential benefits, saying ""we'll discover new technologies, build new businesses and create new jobs."" Howard Hayden, a professor of physics at the University of Connecticut who runs a newsletter called The Energy Advocate, said he believes good data has been gleaned from 20 years of global warming research. ""The data collection is useful and necessary,"" he said. Another scientist, Dr. Mitchell Taylor of the department of geography at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ont., said funding priorities for the federal government need to be reshaped. There should be an ""independent reconciliation"" of the climate-change data that has been researched by the government and private institutions, he told FoxNews.com. He is calling for an independent body of experts -- including critics of the global warming hypothesis -- to sort through all the conflicting research. What's more, he said, the government should re-frame research to look critically at the global warming hypothesis in light of the recent data and ""investigate in a fair and balanced manner alternative explanations for climate change."" What, exactly, will the American taxpayer get for its global warming research dollars? The EPA is spending $43 million to implement the greenhouse-gas reporting rule, to perform regulatory work for the largest stationary sources of greenhouse gases, and to develop new standards for cars and trucks. Research being funded at the National Science Foundation seeks to promote ""discoveries needed to inspire societal actions leading to environmental and economic sustainability,"" according to an agency statement. The NSF's portfolio for global warming will reach $766 million. NSF and EPA spokesmen in Washington did not return e-mails requesting additional comment on the increased spending. But a fact sheet from the White House Office of Management and Budget portrays the global warming funding as part of the Obama administration's new jobs-creation policy, which aims at making the U.S. ""the world leader in developing the clean energy technologies that will lead to the industries and jobs of tomorrow."" Last year's budget provided $2.0 billion for the climate science program, a figure that doesn't include the half a billion in stimulus money that the White House directed to global warming, as Obama's science adviser recently told Congress. ""Investments in climate science over the past several decades have contributed to an improved understanding of the global climate,"" said John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, in testimony before a House committee.

Key Climate Change Data Laden With Errors,"A science blogger uncovered a catalogue of errors in records that form a key part of the scientific evidence for global warming, it emerged Tuesday. The mistakes, which led to the data from a large number of weather stations being discarded or misused, were overlooked by professional scientists and only discovered when Britain's national weather service, the Met Office, made data publicly available in December after the so-called Climate-gate e-mail scandal. Although the errors did not alter the bigger picture on climate change, they were seized upon as a further sign that scientific institutions were not sufficiently transparent. ""It makes you wonder how many other problems there are in the data,"" said John Graham-Cumming, the programmer who spotted the mistakes. ""The whole idea of doing science without releasing your data is quite worrying."" After being alerted of the problems last month, the Met Office issued a corrected version of its land-based temperature record on its Web site. ""We are grateful to Dr. Graham-Cumming, but they are quite minor changes,"" said Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the Met Office. ""It shows how open we are. We have put an exhaustive amount of information out there to show people exactly what we do."" The errors related to the calculation of the average global temperature trend since 1850, based on measurements from land-based thermometers. The record is regarded as one of the most robust pieces of empirical evidence for global warming during the past century. After trying to reproduce figures shown in scientific publications and on the Met Office Web site, Graham-Cumming identified a number of problems with the way measurements from Australian weather stations were averaged. He found that data from seven stations was discarded. Data from a further 112 Australian stations, 28 percent of the total, were not being fully included in calculations of year-on-year temperature differences. ""I'm not a climate skeptic, I think it's pretty sure that the world is warming up, but this does show why the raw data and not just the results should be available,"" he said. During the checking procedure, Met Office officials discovered further problems with U.S. temperature calculations. They realized that 121 of the U.S. stations did not have unique identifier codes, meaning that data for these stations was either being overwritten or assigned to the wrong location. When all of the errors identified were corrected, the temperature trend remained well within the 95 percent confidence range of the original plot, meaning that the difference would not be considered scientifically significant.

"Boxer Declares Climate Change as the Greatest Threat, But Opponents Slam Theory","Terrorism. Nuclear weapons. Corrupt and oppressive regimes. Sen. Barbara Boxer said last week that climate change -- not any of that other stuff -- will stand as the ""leading cause of conflict"" over the next two decades. The comment was apparently based on reports and studies over the past few years that have linked climate change to other security issues, but her colleagues -- as well as her Senate campaign opponent -- described the prediction as a big stretch. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., Boxer's Republican counterpart on the environment committee she chairs and arguably the most outspoken global warming skeptic in Congress, decried the warning on Tuesday as a bogus ploy to win support for a sweeping energy regulation bill. ""We know global warming alarmists frequently use scare tactics to push the U.S. to pass costly cap-and-trade legislation. But to say that carbon emissions will be the leading cause of conflict in the next 20 years represents a new low in alarmist propaganda,"" Inhofe, ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a written statement to FoxNews.com. ""Given the tremendous security challenges confronting our nation today -- from Iran, North Korea, Islamic extremism and much else -- Senator Boxer's statement seems a bit out of touch. I would hope that she simply misspoke."" The chairwoman of the EPW committee made the remark on the floor last Thursday, when the Senate was taking up a challenge to the Obama administration's EPA rules that would cut greenhouse gas emissions. Democrats succeeded in stopping the Republican-led resolution, with the help of senators like Boxer. On the floor, she warned that climate change would have far-reaching consequences in the not-so-distant future. ""I'm going to put in the record ... a host of quotes from our national security experts who tell us that carbon pollution leading to climate change will be over the next 20 years the leading cause of conflict, putting our troops in harm's way,"" Boxer said. ""And that's why we have so many returning veterans who want us to move forward and address this issue."" According to Boxer's office, the senator believes climate change will be ""one of the"" leading causes of conflict -- not necessarily the primary cause -- despite her statement on the floor last Thursday. It's unclear whether Boxer simply misspoke or whether she was intentionally escalating her warning. Boxer's office backed up her statement afterward by pointing to a Pentagon report that discussed the security implications of climate change; the creation by the CIA of a Center on Climate Change and National Security; and a statement from 33 retired generals and other high-ranking military officials saying climate change is ""making the world a more dangerous place."" But the recent studies and statements on the connection between climate change and other problems generally do not conclude that the issue will drive all-out chaos on a global scale. Rather, they say climate change has the potential to exacerbate existing problems like poverty and droughts and social tensions. That was the conclusion reached by a National Intelligence Assessment in 2008 that found climate change could lead to food and water shortages, among other problems, and in turn fuel conflict. ""Climate change alone is unlikely to trigger state failure in any state out to 2030, but the impacts will worsen existing problems,"" then-National Intelligence Council Chairman Thomas Fingar said in a statement to Congress. Fingar said the problems would hit poor, developing countries hardest leading to pressure on the U.S. military to respond, but that the United States might actually ""benefit slightly"" from climate change over the next few decades because of ""increased agricultural yields."" The Pentagon's latest Quadrennial Defense Review also concluded that climate change would contribute to ""food and water scarcity"" and could worsen ""mass migration."" The report said that ""climate change alone does not cause conflict,"" though it ""may act as an accelerant"" of instability. Even that conclusion has been called into question by experts who say the theory lets bad governments and bad leaders off the hook by blaming future problems on climate. Idean Salehyan, a University of North Texas professor who co-authored a book on this subject, wrote a column in 2007, when the theory started to gain traction, in which he called predictions of ""apocalyptic"" consequences from climate change ""misleading"" and ""irresponsible."" ""They shift liability for wars and human rights abuses away from oppressive, corrupt governments,"" he wrote. Salehyan could not be reached for comment for this article. The Heritage Foundation's James Carafano testified last year before Boxer's committee that political violence has actually dropped as emissions have risen. ""The environment does not cause wars -- it is how humans respond to their environment that causes conflicts. Climate change does not necessarily ensure that there will be more or less conflict,"" he said. The campaign of Boxer's Republican opponent, Carly Fiorina, cited Carafano's testimony and others in criticizing the senator's claim from last week. ""We can all agree that terrorists pose a serious security threat to our nation. However, there is wide disagreement within the security community, and the American people, about the role climate change plays in global security. Despite this, Barbara Boxer has chosen to fight for cap-and-trade legislation under the auspices that somehow raising energy prices and costing America jobs will make us safer,"" Fiorina spokeswoman Amy Thoma said in a written statement to FoxNews.com. Robert Dillon, spokesman for EPW committee member Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Boxer was ""overstating"" the problem. He said Democrats have been employing a lot of ""hype"" to try building support for the stalled cap-and-trade energy bill. Murkowski sponsored the EPA challenge that was defeated last week. ""I think we all understand that climate change adds to those issues [detailed in the studies],"" Dillon said. ""What made Senator Boxer make that leap? ... I have no idea.""",15/06/2010,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/boxer-declares-climate-change-as-the-greatest-threat-but-opponents-slam-theory
Clinton Invokes Climate Change Debate to Explain Pakistan Floods,"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other officials are pointing to the devastating floods in Pakistan and other extreme weather events as signs that climate change is getting worse. Clinton, in an interview with Pakistan's Dawn TV, said ""there is a linkage"" between the recent spate of deadly natural disasters and climate change. ""You can't point to any particular disaster and say, 'it was caused by,' but we are changing the climate of the world,"" she said. Clinton said that on top of the Pakistan floods, which have forced millions out of their homes, the forest fires in Russia stand as another example. She said there's no ""direct link"" between the disasters in Pakistan and Russia but that ""when you have the changes in climate that affect weather that we're now seeing, I think the predictions of more natural disasters are unfortunately being played out."" Climate change skeptics say the planet is going through natural phases -- the kind it's gone through for eons. Pakistan, in particular, is prone to flooding and is routinely drenched by the monsoon rains. Some officials have partially blamed deforestation and inferior levee systems for the historic flooding which has affected one-fifth of the country's landmass and triggered nearly a half-billion dollars in international aid commitments. Scientists who study climate change tend to offer more nuance in their explanations of the possible link to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions. They generally say that no one natural disaster can be chalked up to man-caused climate change, but that it can contribute to those disasters happening more frequently and more intensely. Both the U.N. International Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization reiterated that point in light of the Pakistan floods. WMO climate data chief Omar Baddour was quoted saying it's ""too early to point to a human fingerprint"" behind the recent disasters but climate change may be ""exacerbating the intensity"" of them. But some government officials have shown little equivocation in directly linking the Pakistan disaster with climate change. Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Pakistan's foreign minister, said Thursday that his country's flooding ""reconfirms our extreme vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change."" Click here to read more at AolNews.com. The flooding and Russian forest fires, which were sparked following a severe drought, coincide with record heat elsewhere in addition to downpours and landslides in China. The renewed concerns over climate change come after international talks on a new treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions fell short at a summit last December in Copenhagen. Talks over climate change legislation have also stalled in the U.S. Congress.",21/08/2010,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/clinton-invokes-climate-change-debate-to-explain-pakistan-floods
School Children 'Blown Up' for Not Fighting Climate Change in Controversial Ad,"A British ad for a climate change campaign shows corporate workers, a famous soccer player and even school children being blown up for not agreeing to cut their carbon emissions, a blood-splattering display that has drawn anger from critics and sheepish embarrassment from its supporters. The short film, ""No Pressure,"" which promotes the U.K.'s 10:10 climate change campaign, debuted on the campaign's website Friday. It depicts a school teacher, a corporate boss and a soccer coach asking their respective students, employees and players to participate in the 10:10 campaign to reduce carbon emissions. Despite being told there is ""no pressure"" to join the cause, those who say they don't plan to participate are immediately blown up by their superiors with the push of a button; the others are left standing in awe and covered in bloody remains. The film was written by ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" screenwriter Richard Curtis and directed by music video and commercial director Dougal Wilson. It features actress Gillian Anderson, British soccer stars Peter Crouch and David Ginola and music by Radiohead. But despite the star-studded credits, the charities behind the film told the Guardian they were ""absolutely appalled"" by the video, which was pulled from circulation in U.K. movie theaters within hours of its release amid a storm of protest. ""We think the 10:10 campaign is very important, but the moment this film was seen it was clear it was inappropriate,"" ActionAid, a charity that co-ordinates the 10:10 schools program, told the Guardian. The 10:10 campaign said that the video was intended to revive the issue of climate change in the media in a way that would make people laugh. To a degree, it said, it succeeded. ""Many people found the resulting film extremely funny, but unfortunately some didn't and 10:10 would like to apologize to everybody who was offended by the film,"" 10:10 said in a statement Friday. The group removed the ad from its website; it said it won't attempt to censor any other versions in circulation on the Internet. Click here to see the video on YouTube (Warning: graphic content). But the campaign's founder still stands by the film. ""We 'killed' five people to make No Pressure - a mere blip compared to the 300,000 real people who now die each year from climate change,"" Franny Armstrong told the Telegraph. Curtis said he hopes the provocative nature of the film doesn't deter from its message. ""When you try to be funny on a serious subject, it's obviously risky,"" he told the Guardian. ""I hope people who don't like the little film will still think about the big issue and try to do something about it."" But critics say the video will have the opposite effect. ""While I can sort of see where the writer was trying to go with his comedy here, the message that comes across FIRST and with the most power most assuredly is: Think how we think, do as we do or die,' a YouTube viewer commented. ""This was not the intent, however, anyone trying to state that it is not the result is sadly mistaken. I find this to be a horrific message in its entirety."" ""It's pretty clear what the environmental movement thinks about human beings in this video. Especially dissenters,"" another viewer wrote. The campaign, which was launched in Sept 1, 2009, and aims to cut 10 percent of emissions in the developed world by the end of 2010, says it'll do better next time. ""At 10:10 we're all about trying new and creative ways of getting people to take action on climate change,"" the 10:10 team said in the statement. ""Unfortunately in this instance we missed the mark. Oh well, we live and learn.""",04/10/2010,https://www.foxnews.com/science/school-children-blown-up-for-not-fighting-climate-change-in-controversial-ad
"Climate Change No Threat, Says Czech President","Climate change is not a threat and the consequences of global warming will not be catastrophic, the President of the Czech Republic said on Tuesday. Vaclav Klaus is a vocal sceptic on the topic of global warming. He published a book in 2007 in which he said global warming had turned into a new religion, an ideology that threatens to undermine freedom and the world's economic and social order. ""Global warming in the last 150 years was modest and future warming and its consequences will not be dangerous or catastrophic. It doesn't look like a threat we should respond to,"" he told a lecture in London on Tuesday. ""I don't see empirical evidence of human-caused global warming. I see so many mistakes in the methodology of science and modelling,"" he added. Many analysts and scientists believe this year could be one of the warmest on record worldwide and the world's nations are trying to curb their greenhouse gas emissions based on scientific predictions of rising sea levels and temperatures. In the first four months of 2010, land and ocean temperatures were 56 degrees Fahrenheit (13.3 C) and 1.24 F (0.69 C) above the 20th century average, the warmest on record in U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data. However, public opinion has shown resistance to strong action to combat climate change, especially after a U.N. summit in Copenhagen last year failed to seal a global deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions and scandals emerged surrounding climate science. Klaus said the debate over the threat of climate change was biased, subject to propaganda and used by governments and lobbyists to earn more power for themselves. Over the past 10,000 years, the world's climate has been much the same as at present, he argued. ""Average surface temperatures did not vary significantly. If there has been any long-term trend, it is an overall gentle cooling trend,"" the president said. He denounced scientific institutions such as the UK's Royal Society which published a layman's guide to the science of climate change in September in the hope of clarifying confusion around the issue. ""I am not impressed by heavily biased British scientific institutions,"" he said.",19/10/2010,https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-no-threat-says-czech-president
Google Wades Into Global Warming Debate,"Google is diving headfirst into the climate-change debate with a ""21 Club"" of hand-picked experts that the search engine giant hopes will drive the conversation -- and guide investments -- in climate change. But it's a discussion that even the club's members say is meant to be one-sided. If Google included people who challenged that debate, they would be wrong to do so, said Matthew Nisbet, an associate professor for the School of Communication at American University and one of the 21 Google Science Communication Fellows. As to whether climate change is happening, humans are a cause and it is a problem -- there is no scientific debate over that,"" Nisbet told FoxNews.com. A review of the 21 Club confirms Nisbet's comment. The group includes meteorologists, communication specialists, and even weather forecasters, as well as few scientists who research climate change for a living. None argue that the planet isn't in imminent danger. Simon Donner, with the University of British Columbia, recently wrote that unless coral reefs learn to adapt, climate change may rapidly bring on their demise. Noah Diffenbaugh of Stanford University recently concluded that ""global warming exacerbates poverty vulnerability in many nations,"" arguing that the cost of food staples in Bangladesh, Mexico, Indonesia and other countries will jump with the temperature. ""There is consensus amongst scientists that humans are changing the Earth's climate,"" reads the mission statement on the Helmuth Lab website, headed up by Brian Helmuth of the 21 Club. From food to rocks to plants to sea life, the 21 Club believes climate change to be a dramatic problem -- one that requires dramatic action. Eugene Cordero with San Jose University even created the Green Ninja, a climate-action superhero who fights global warming. Our goal is to foster an open dialogue and provide the tools, argued Amy Luers, the senior environment program manager at Google.org, the non-profit funded by Google, speaking to FoxNews.com. Depending on what the scientists learn, they may develop a system that shows where climate change is occurring on the globe. Or, using technology such as Google Earth, they might map out detailed models showing the effects of climate change. In other words, some day you might be able to find out that the water near Costa Rica is 1 percentage point warmer since 1980, or that Alaska's glaciers have melted ... slightly. Google's position toward climate change should not come as a surprise; the company has historically shown a penchant for Democratic causes. As FoxNews.com reported last October, Google gives more to Democratic politicians than to Republicans, for example. Follow the money So what's Google up to, anyway? Part of the motivation seems to be funding new climate change research. Jack Gold, a research analyst, told FoxNews.com that promoting new research often ends up generating new product ideas. He said having good models for climate change can also feed into the company's own data visualization efforts. The company likely sees the search term climate change popping up in search results, too. They are probably reacting to what people are interested in, Gold said. Jon Peddie, a consumer analyst with Jon Peddie Research, told FoxNews.com that Google may have other motives in mind. They are pursuing offshore wind farms along the East Coast of the U.S. and probably want to build a solid case for the need to get off oil, said Peddie. Whatever the reason for the project, Google has big ambitions: Google.org has already doled out about $100 million in grants, mostly to green tech start-ups and alternative energy consortiums. Google to the rescue? Climate studies also involve enormous data sets from many sources and massive computing requirements for data collection. Google has the computing muscle to help analyze that data and make sense of it. It includes conventional weather data collected by the meteorological services of the world, at the surface of the Earth and in the atmosphere from balloon-borne instruments and satellites,"" said Richard C. J. Somerville, a research professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, one of the primary sources of climate-change data. ""It also includes satellite and ship and buoy data to give ocean temperatures. It includes measurements of glaciers and ice sheets and sea ice, made from satellites and on the ice itself. Another key purpose is to make climate-change data more accessible, to use the parlance of Google's mission statement -- and more discoverable, of course. The company likely has pure motives, tech analyst Roger Kay told FoxNews.com. But Google is also interested in important issues that make the company look good. This promotes Googles overall brand, to be associated with problems and perhaps solutions. And finally, don't forget that it may all come down to business consideration. Remember all those people searching for ""climate change""? Google wont be able to sell ads if we wipe ourselves out by not mitigating the effects of climate change, joked Kay.",05/04/2011,https://www.foxnews.com/science/google-wades-into-global-warming-debate
Green Smoke and Mirrors? Vatican Weighs in on Climate Change,"A scientific branch of the Vatican is touting a climate-change report that fears for the fate of the world's glaciers, appearing to support an erroneous conclusion from the United Nations' climate panel that skeptics have loudly debunked. But the Vatican's authors are some of the same people responsible for the U.N. error, even including Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the U.N.'s climate group and the man behind the 2007 report that feared ""the likelihood of [the Himalayan glaciers] disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner."" The facts behind that assertion quickly melted away, with Pachauri himself admitting that ""poorly substantiated estimates"" had made it into print. But like his 2007 U.N. study, Pachauri's 2011 Vatican report, titled ""Fate of Mountain Glaciers in the Anthropocene,"" again frets over the fate of the glaciers -- and it cites his U.N. report as evidence. The new report, commissioned by the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences, notes that ""thousands of small glaciers in the Hindukush-Himalayan-Tibetan region continue to disintegrate,"" and states that ""robust scenario calculations clearly indicate that many mountain ranges worldwide could lose major parts of their glaciers within the coming decades."" Noted climate skeptic Don Easterbrook, an emeritus professor of geology at Western Washington University, is one vocal critic of these and other conclusions on the fate of the world's glaciers. ""The [U.N.]-predicted warming of 1 degree between 2000 and the present has not happened -- instead it's gotten cooler!"" he told FoxNews.com. ""As a result, some glaciers in the Himalayas have begun advancing, and glaciers in Alaska, Norway, and South America have also begun to re-advance."" ""Pachauri is very intolerant of any point on climate change that isn't his,"" Patrick J. Michaels, a contributing author on the U.N. report and a senior fellow with the conservative CATO Institute, told FoxNews.com. ""He makes statements that are just wrong, because he's not a climate scientist,"" he said. Pachauri did not respond to FoxNews.com requests for more information, sent through his U.N. climate group. Neither did the climate group itself nor the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences return FoxNews.com requests. But a Vatican spokesman, Rev. Federico Lombardi, did tell the Associated Press that the document was ""important,"" although it was not a piece of the church's key teachings. Other climate scientists agreed with the new report. Graham Cogley, geography professor with Trent University, agreed that the 2007 prediction that Himalayan glaciers might disappear by 2035 was flat wrong -- but not the current claims. ""It is a dire prediction to say that mountain glaciers are 'lethally vulnerable' to climatic change, but it is literally and unquestionably correct,"" he told FoxNews.com. Michaels was more skeptical. ""Why resources collected from parishioners were used for this is beyond me,"" Michaels told FoxNews.com. ""There has been an increasing tendency over the years for churches to insert themselves into the global warming thing,"" he added. Well-known climate scientist Michael Mann thought the report may indicate shifting beliefs within the church. I actually attended a meeting of the Pontifical Academy (World Federation of Scientists) in Erice, Sicily, back in late August 2003,"" Mann told FoxNews.com. ""At the time, the president of the organization, Antonio Zichichi, was a climate-change skeptic."" ""Zichichi has the ear of the Vatican on all matters of science and science policy. So I interpret this as, perhaps, a change of heart on his part,"" Mann told FoxNews.com. ""In any case, this is indeed a significant (and in my view auspicious) development."" The Pontifical Academy of Sciences, a Vatican advisory panel, was founded under a different name in Rome in 1603, and claims to be the first exclusively scientific academy in the world. The Pontifical Academicians are eighty women and men from various countries nominated by the Supreme Pontiff. (The exact relation between the World Federation of Scientists and the Pontifical Academy was unclear.) The Academy hosted the conference last month on the causes and consequences of retreating mountain glaciers. Its final report, dated May 5 and signed by a group of climate scientists, hydrologists, chemists, lawyers and mountaineers, was posted on the Vatican website Tuesday. The group also noted that another major risk to glaciers is the threat of nuclear war, and advocated a reduction in nuclear arsenals.",12/05/2011,https://www.foxnews.com/science/green-smoke-and-mirrors-vatican-weighs-in-on-climate-change

Al Gore Compares Climate Change to Civil Rights Fight,"Former Vice President Al Gore is comparing the struggle to win over climate change skeptics to the fight against racism. When racist comments would come up in the course of conversations, There came a time when people said, 'Hey man, why do you talk that way? That's wrong, I don't go for that, so don't talk that way around me. I just don't believe that,' Gore said in an interview Friday with FearLess Revolution founder Alex Bogusky. ""That happened in millions of conversations, and slowly the conversation was won, Gore said. And we still have racism, God knows, but it's so different now and so much better. And we have to win the conversation on climate. Gore also wants people to give up meat and go organic to combat global warming. ""Industrial agriculture is a part of the problem, Gore said. The shift toward a more meat-intensive diet, the clearing of forest areas in many parts of the world in order to raise more cattle and the reliance on synthetic nitrogen for fertilizer are also problems, he added. Gore advocated organic farming and relying on more productive, safer methods that put carbon back in the soil to produce safer and better food. Gore also railed against the mining industry, calling mountaintop-removal mining a horrible practice that is just incredibly harmful to the environment and to people.

Kauri trees hold secrets to climate change,"At The Kauri Museum in Matakohe, New Zealand, biologist Dr. Jonathan Palmer explains a novel approach to assessing global climate change - by analyzing the rings of ancient kauri trees. This work, published in the February 5th 2012 edition of the science journal Nature online, represents one more dimension of planetary climate assessment, and is already making a contribution to our understanding of how Earths climate has altered over the years. The article, Multi-centennial tree-ring record of ENSO-related activity in New Zealand, was written by a Dr. Anthony Fowler, and a team of scientists, including Palmer.  The term ENSO refers to El Nino/Southern Oscillation, a phenomenon of temperature change that shifts and changes on a global scale over time. At one time, vast forests of kauri (Agathis australis) covered much of northern New  Zealand. The majestic trees with immense crowns are unique to the northern island of New Zealand, and are now regarded as biological treasures. But over the past several centuries, both Maori natives and colonial settlers have burned down, cut down, or otherwise greatly reduced the population of kauri trees to approximately 3% of their former density. Today the few remaining ancient kauri trees are protected by environmental agencies, and are tourist attractions, much like the redwoods of California. The kauri is a hardwood tree, and grows to a huge proportion. Some kauri trees have measured as much as fifty feet or more in diameter, yielding hundreds of tons of timber each. Especially in the 1800s and early 1900s, cutting down kauri trees for ship-building, home construction, and post wood was a big industry in New Zealand. Some kauri trees grow for more than 1,500 years each, and as a result represent a biological storage space of information about climate history. Even more, many ancient kauri trees, dating as far back as 30,000 years, have been found well-preserved in swamps, enabling scientists to analyze climate history going back tens of thousands of years. Scientists have known for a long time that tree rings indicate annual growth cycles. The width, color and composition of tree rings reveal information about environmental conditions, including temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. By analyzing samples of wood from the cores of ancient kauri trees, scientists have been able to establish certain cycles of global temperature, including very hot periods and very cold periods. With this information they have generated a climatic graph that covers several thousand years. Today the issue of global climate change is a hot topic, and the key question is whether or not human activity is making a significant difference in global warming. According to the assessment of kauri rings presented in the Nature article, global temperature has risen at different periods over millennia. It also appears that in the twentieth century, significant warming of global climate has occurred. Evidence of this has been recorded by temperature measure with thermometers since their invention, and reaching back into longer history with ice-core drilling. At the Kauri Museum, immense sections of kauri, as well as extensive photography of the former kauri timber industry, are on display. The photographic records available show vast forests that fed a hungry timber industry until most of the trees were gone and the industry collapsed. Today Jonathan Palmer is working on a project to help repopulate kauri trees, and to establish a sustainable kauri timber industry. But hes just getting started. Global climate impacts human health, wildlife, and all biological assets including food crops. Rising temperatures affect weather, and are altering life on a planetary scale. And it has branched into the realm of politics, becoming a very hot button issue.  But a variety of scientific measures spanning long periods of time can shed light on global climate in a manner that political arguments cannot. It may be that the assessment of kauri rings from ancient trees will help to clarify what remains a confusing and hotly disputed issue that affects us all.

"Global warming skeptics as knowledgeable about science as climate change believers, study says","Are global warming skeptics anti-science? Or just ignorant about science? Maybe neither. A study published Sunday in the journal Nature Climate Change finds that people who are not that worried about the effects of global warming tend to have a slightly higher level of scientific knowledge than those who are worried, as determined by their answers to questions like: ""Electrons are smaller than atoms -- true or false? ""How long does it take the Earth to go around the Sun? One day, one month, or one year?"" Lasers work by focusing sound waves -- true or false? The quiz, containing 22 questions about both science and statistics, was given to 1,540 representative Americans. Respondents who were relatively less worried about global warming got 57 percent of them right, on average, just barely outscoring those whose who saw global warming as a bigger threat. They got 56 percent of the questions correct. [pullquote] ""As respondents science literacy scores increased, their concern with climate change decreased,"" the paper, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, notes. Yale Law Professor Dan Kahan, the lead author of the study, cautioned that the survey results are not evidence for or against climate change. ""This study is agnostic on what people ought to believe,"" he told FoxNews.com. ""It just doesnt follow to say this finding implies anything about what people should believe on this issue."" Kahan said that he thought another finding of the study was more important: That peoples cultural views  how much they value things like individualism and equality -- affect their views on global warming much more than actual knowledge about science. Regardless of how much they know about science, individualists were relatively unconcerned about global warming, whereas those who value equality were very concerned. Both sides of the global warming debate say the study's findings support their views. Those who worry about global warming say it shows that cultural biases blind even smart people to the scientific consensus. ""Kahans research is so interesting, Aaron Huertas, a spokesman for the Union of Concerned Scientists, told FoxNews.com. Over the last few years, the policy issues surrounding climate change have become increasingly politicized, and thats bleeding over into peoples perceptions of climate science. ""What we need to remember is that we have a number of excellent non-partisan scientific resources... [They] all tell us that human activity is altering the climate in ways that are disruptive to our economy and way of life."" But some of the 16 scientists who signed a letter this January titled ""No Need to Panic About Global Warming"" disagree.

"4,000 years ago, climate change caused massive civilization collapse","The mysterious fall of the largest of the world's earliest urban civilizations nearly 4,000 years ago in what is now India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh now appears to have a key culprit  ancient climate change, researchers say. Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia may be the best known of the first great urban cultures, but the largest was the Indus or Harappan civilization. This culture once extended over more than 386,000 square miles (1 million square kilometers) across the plains of the Indus River from the Arabian Sea to the Ganges, and at its peak may have accounted for 10 percent of the world population. The civilization developed about 5,200 years ago, and slowly disintegrated between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago  populations largely abandoned cities, migrating toward the east. ""Antiquity knew about Egypt and Mesopotamia, but the Indus civilization, which was bigger than these two, was completely forgotten until the 1920s,"" said researcher Liviu Giosan, a geologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. ""There are still many things we don't know about them."" [pullquote] Nearly a century ago, researchers began discovering numerous remains of Harappan settlements along the Indus River and its tributaries, as well as in a vast desert region at the border of India and Pakistan. Evidence was uncovered for sophisticated cities, sea links with Mesopotamia, internal trade routes, arts and crafts, and as-yet undeciphered writing. ""They had cities ordered into grids, with exquisite plumbing, which was not encountered again until the Romans,"" Giosan told LiveScience. ""They seem to have been a more democratic society than Mesopotamia and Egypt  no large structures were built for important personalitiess like kings or pharaohs."" Like their contemporaries in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Harappans, who were named after one of their largest cities, lived next to rivers. ""Until now, speculations abounded about the links between this mysterious ancient culture and its life-giving mighty rivers,"" Giosan said. Now Giosan and his colleagues have reconstructed the landscape of the plain and rivers where this long-forgotten civilization developed. Their findings now shed light on the enigmatic fate of this culture. ""Our research provides one of the clearest examples of climate change leading to the collapse of an entire civilization,"" Giosan said. [How Weather Changed History] The researchers first analyzed satellite data of the landscape influenced by the Indus and neighboring rivers. From 2003 to 2008, the researchers then collected samples of sediment from the coast of the Arabian Sea into the fertile irrigated valleys of Punjab and the northern Thar Desert to determine the origins and ages of those sediments and develop a timeline of landscape changes. ""It was challenging working in the desert  temperatures were over 110 degrees Fahrenheit all day long (43 degrees C),"" Giosan recalled. After collecting data on geological history, ""we could reexamine what we know about settlements, what crops people were planting and when, and how both agriculture and settlement patterns changed,"" said researcher Dorian Fuller, an archaeologist with University College London. ""This brought new insights into the process of eastward population shift, the change towards many more small farming communities, and the decline of cities during late Harappan times."" Some had suggested that the Harappan heartland received its waters from a large glacier-fed Himalayan river, thought by some to be the Sarasvati, a sacred river of Hindu mythology. However, the researchers found that only rivers fed by monsoon rains flowed through the region. Previous studies suggest the Ghaggar, an intermittent river that flows only during strong monsoons, may best approximate the location of the Sarasvati. Archaeological evidence suggested the river, which dissipates into the desert along the dried course of Hakra valley, was home to intensive settlement during Harappan times. ""We think we settled a long controversy about the mythic Sarasvati River,"" Giosan said. Initially, the monsoon-drenched rivers the researchers identified were prone to devastating floods. Over time, monsoons weakened, enabling agriculture and civilization to flourish along flood-fed riverbanks for nearly 2,000 years. ""The insolation  the solar energy received by the Earth from the sun  varies in cycles, which can impact monsoons,"" Giosan said. ""In the last 10,000 years, the Northern Hemisphere had the highest insolation from 7,000 to 5,000 years ago, and since then insolation there decreased. All climate on Earth is driven by the sun, and so the monsoons were affected by the lower insolation, decreasing in force. This meant less rain got into continental regions affected by monsoons over time."" [50 Amazing Facts About Earth] Eventually, these monsoon-based rivers held too little water and dried, making them unfavorable for civilization. ""The Harappans were an enterprising people taking advantage of a window of opportunity  a kind of ""Goldilocks civilization,"" Giosan said. Eventually, over the course of centuries, Harappans apparently fled along an escape route to the east toward the Ganges basin, where monsoon rains remained reliable. ""We can envision that this eastern shift involved a change to more localized forms of economy  smaller communities supported by local rain-fed farming and dwindling streams,"" Fuller said. ""This may have produced smaller surpluses, and would not have supported large cities, but would have been reliable."" This change would have spelled disaster for the cities of the Indus, which were built on the large surpluses seen during the earlier, wetter era. The dispersal of the population to the east would have meant there was no longer a concentrated workforce to support urbanism. ""Cities collapsed, but smaller agricultural communities were sustainable and flourished,"" Fuller said. ""Many of the urban arts, such as writing, faded away, but agriculture continued and actually diversified."" These findings could help guide future archaeological explorations of the Indus civilization. Researchers can now better guess which settlements might have been more significant, based on their relationships with rivers, Giosan said. It remains uncertain how monsoons will react to modern climate change. ""If we take the devastating floods that caused the largest humanitarian disaster in Pakistan's history as a sign of increased monsoon activity, than this doesn't bode well for the region,"" Giosan said. ""The region has the largest irrigation scheme in the world, and all those dams and channels would become obsolete in the face of the large floods an increased monsoon would bring.""

This summer is 'what global warming looks like',"Is it just freakish weather or something more? Climate scientists suggest that if you want a glimpse of some of the worst of global warming, take a look at U.S. weather in recent weeks. Horrendous wildfires. Oppressive heat waves. Devastating droughts. Flooding from giant deluges. And a powerful freak wind storm called a derecho. These are the kinds of extremes experts have predicted will come with climate change, although it's far too early to say that is the cause. Nor will they say global warming is the reason 3,215 daily high temperature records were set in the month of June. Scientifically linking individual weather events to climate change takes intensive study, complicated mathematics, computer models and lots of time. Sometimes it isn't caused by global warming. Weather is always variable; freak things happen. And this weather has been local. Europe, Asia and Africa aren't having similar disasters now, although they've had their own extreme events in recent years. But since at least 1988, climate scientists have warned that climate change would bring, in general, increased heat waves, more droughts, more sudden downpours, more widespread wildfires and worsening storms. In the United States, those extremes are happening here and now. So far this year, more than 2.1 million acres have burned in wildfires, more than 113 million people in the U.S. were in areas under extreme heat advisories last Friday, two-thirds of the country is experiencing drought, and earlier in June, deluges flooded Minnesota and Florida. ""This is what global warming looks like at the regional or personal level,"" said Jonathan Overpeck, professor of geosciences and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona. ""The extra heat increases the odds of worse heat waves, droughts, storms and wildfire. This is certainly what I and many other climate scientists have been warning about."" Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in fire-charred Colorado, said these are the very record-breaking conditions he has said would happen, but many people wouldn't listen. So it's I told-you-so time, he said. As recently as March, a special report an extreme events and disasters by the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of ""unprecedented extreme weather and climate events."" Its lead author, Chris Field of the Carnegie Institution and Stanford University, said Monday, ""It's really dramatic how many of the patterns that we've talked about as the expression of the extremes are hitting the U.S. right now."" ""What we're seeing really is a window into what global warming really looks like,"" said Princeton University geosciences and international affairs professor Michael Oppenheimer. ""It looks like heat. It looks like fires. It looks like this kind of environmental disasters."" Oppenheimer said that on Thursday. That was before the East Coast was hit with triple-digit temperatures and before a derecho  a large, powerful and long-lasting straight-line wind storm  blew from Chicago to Washington. The storm and its aftermath killed more than 20 people and left millions without electricity. Experts say it had energy readings five times that of normal thunderstorms. Fueled by the record high heat, this was among the strongest of this type of storm in the region in recent history, said research meteorologist Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storm Laboratory in Norman, Okla. Scientists expect ""non-tornadic wind events"" like this one and other thunderstorms to increase with climate change because of the heat and instability, he said. Such patterns haven't happened only in the past week or two. The spring and winter in the U.S. were the warmest on record and among the least snowy, setting the stage for the weather extremes to come, scientists say. Since Jan. 1, the United States has set more than 40,000 hot temperature records, but fewer than 6,000 cold temperature records, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Through most of last century, the U.S. used to set cold and hot records evenly, but in the first decade of this century America set two hot records for every cold one, said Jerry Meehl, a climate extreme expert at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. This year the ratio is about 7 hot to 1 cold. Some computer models say that ratio will hit 20-to-1 by midcentury, Meehl said. ""In the future you would expect larger, longer more intense heat waves and we've seen that in the last few summers,"" NOAA Climate Monitoring chief Derek Arndt said. The 100-degree heat, drought, early snowpack melt and beetles waking from hibernation early to strip trees all combined to set the stage for the current unusual spread of wildfires in the West, said University of Montana ecosystems professor Steven Running, an expert on wildfires. While at least 15 climate scientists told The Associated Press that this long hot U.S. summer is consistent with what is to be expected in global warming, history is full of such extremes, said John Christy at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. He's a global warming skeptic who says, ""The guilty party in my view is Mother Nature."" But the vast majority of mainstream climate scientists, such as Meehl, disagree: ""This is what global warming is like, and we'll see more of this as we go into the future."" ___ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on extreme weather: http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/ U.S. weather records: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/records/ ___ Seth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears",03/07/2012,https://www.foxnews.com/us/this-summer-is-what-global-warming-looks-like
Is climate change to blame for recent heat waves?,"It's no surprise to those who follow climate science that temperature patterns have shifted as the world has warmed up. But in a new study, outspoken climate scientist James Hansen goes a step further, saying devastating heat waves in recent years are the result of global warming. Since natural dynamics  such as fluctuations in sea-surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean  contribute to extreme events like heat waves, this connection can be controversial. Scientists disagree on the degree to which global warming can be blamed for extreme events, such as heat waves, and Hansen, of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and no stranger to controversy, is among those most aggressive about making this connection. In the last three decades, both average and extreme temperatures have warmed up and heat waves hit much large areas, Hansen and colleagues write in a study published online Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [pullquote] ""It follows that we can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small,"" they write. [Extreme Weather Facts: Quiz Yourself] Martin Hoerling, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Systems Research Laboratory, called this interpretation ""flawed scientifically."" ""The weather patterns responsible for most of today's heat waves would have happened regardless of human-induced climate change,"" Hoerling told LiveScience. Bringing carbon dioxide down to the level Hansen sees as safe ""would not eradicate heat waves."" Hansen's team acknowledges that dynamics other than global warming are at play when a heat wave hits, saying that the abnormally warm temperatures of late are the result of a combination of specific weather patterns and global warming. This description is closer to the truth, Hoerling said. ""In some cases that combination is 95 percent natural and 5 percent climate change, sometimes the mix is a little bit different."" Historically, climate scientists have shied from making a connection between an extreme event and global warming, but more and more so-called attributional studies examine these events for human fingerprints. For example, a 2004 study concluded that human alterations to climate more than doubled the odds of heat waves on the scale of the 2003 scorcher that devastated western Europe. The record-setting 2010 Russian heat wave to which Hansen refers appears to have generated some conflicting analyses. A study in which Hoerling participated concluded this heat wave was due mainly to natural atmospheric variability. Meanwhile, a more recent study led by Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., linked record high sea-surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean and tropical Atlantic Ocean  which were, in turn, influenced by global warming  with the heat wave. With regard to the Russian heat wave, Trenberth told LiveScience he sees his study and Hansen's as taking complementary approaches. Both he and Hansen are at the aggressive end of the spectrum when it comes to attributing weather events to climate change, Trenberth said. ""James Hansen and I are pushing to get scientists to think about and do statistics on this rather differently, and now we are not part of mainstream in this regard."" Trenberth questions why an attribution study is necessary for every single event: ""Human influence is changing the odds, it is pushing things in a direction where we have greater extremes,"" he said. ""Could these things have actually happened without global warming? In most cases, they probably wouldn't. There are very small odds they could have occurred,"" Trenberth said. Hansen could not be reached by deadline. Copyright 2012 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company. All rights reserved.

Climate change skeptics seize on reports showing temperatures leveling,"Climate change skeptics are doing a bit of gloating following a series of mainstream media reports that acknowledge what those skeptics have long held -- the earth is not warming, at least not in the last 10 years. ""The idea that CO2 is the tail that wags the dog is no longer scientifically tenable,"" said Marc Morano of ClimateDepot.com, a website devoted to countering the prevailing acceptance of man-made global warming. In recent weeks, Der Spiegel, the Telegraph and the Economist have reported the unexpected stabilizing of global surface temperatures. Even former NASA scientist and outspoken climate change activist James Hansen has acknowledged the 10-year lull. Morano said: ""In the peer-reviewed literature we're finding hundreds of factors influence global temperature, everything from ocean cycles to the tilt of the earth's axis to water vapor, methane, cloud feedback, volcanic dust, all of these factors are coming together. They're now realizing it wasn't the simple story we've been told of your SUV is creating a dangerously warm planet."" Many climate scientists and environmentalists agree with Morano's description of climate complexity, but reject his denials of global warming as a problem. ""This is a highly complex calculation to make in the first place. The short period of time, only 10 years in which the increasing temperature has leveled, really doesn't tell us very much other than the fact that temperatures may still be rising but just not as fast as they were before,"" said Elgie Holstein, the senior director for strategic planning at the Environmental Defense Fund and a former assistant secretary at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""What's compelling about the climate science,"" Holstein said, ""is that we have literally thousands of the world's leading scientists around the country pretty much saying the same thing about where we're headed, and it's not reassuring."" But the surface temperature stabilization suggests that computer models which predict harsh consequences of global warming may need reassessing. As The Economist put it on March 30, ""It may be that the climate is responding to higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in ways that had not been properly understood before. This possibility, if true, could have profound significance both for climate science and for environmental and social policy."" Indeed, no one disputes that levels of carbon dioxide are increasing globally, but CO2's impact has not been as great as many scientists had predicted. ""In the peer-reviewed literature, they've tried to explain away this lull,"" said Morano. ""In the proceedings of the National Academy of Science a year or two ago they had a study blaming Chinese coal use for the lack of global warming. So, in an ironic twist, global warming proponents are now claiming that that coal use is saving us from dangerous global warming."" Holstein believes the temperature lull is not entirely unexpected or unpredicted. ""We're within ranges of these climate models that are saying we're still on track to some pretty troublesome impacts if we don't do something about it,"" he said. A Gallup survey conducted March 7-10 found 58 percent of Americans say they worry a great deal or fair amount about global warming. That was up from 51 percent in 2011 -- but still below the 62-72 percent levels seen between 1999 and 2001.",09/04/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-change-skeptics-seize-on-reports-showing-temperatures-leveling
Obama planning to sidestep Congress for next phase in climate change agenda,"President Obama will announce Tuesday he is planning to sidestep Congress to implement a national plan to combat climate change that will include the first-ever federal regulations on carbon dioxide emitted by existing power plants, despite adamant opposition from Republicans and some energy producers. In a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday, Obama will announce he's issuing a presidential memorandum to implement the regulations, meaning none of the steps involved in the plan will require congressional approval. In addition, Obama will say he is directing his administration to allow enough renewables on public lands to power 6 million homes by 2020, effectively doubling the capacity from solar, wind and geothermal projects on federal property. Obama also was to announce $8 billion in federal loan guarantees to spur investment in technologies that can keep carbon dioxide produced by power plants from being released into the atmosphere. In taking action on his own, Obama is also signaling he will no longer wait for lawmakers to act on climate change, and instead will seek ways to work around them. The linchpin of Obama's plan, and the step activists say will have the most dramatic impact, involves limits on carbon emissions for new and existing power plants. The Obama administration has already proposed controls on new plants, but those controls have been delayed and not yet finalized. Tuesday's announcement will be the first public confirmation that Obama plans to extend carbon controls to coal-fired power plants that are currently pumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. ""This is the holy grail,"" said Melinda Pierce of Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group. ""That is the single biggest step he can take to help tackle carbon pollution."" However, critics say that Obama's changes will create more problems for America's coal industry. ""This proposal will buttress an EPA proposed rule issued last year for new power plants that will essentially ban coals use in the future,"" Tom Borelli, a senior fellow at FreedomWorks, told FoxNews.com. Forty percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and one-third of greenhouse gases overall, come from electric power plants, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistical agency. Obama is expected to lay out a broad vision Tuesday, without detailed emission targets or specifics about how they will be put in place. Instead, the president will launch a process in which the Environmental Protection Agency will work with states to develop specific plans to rein in carbon emissions, with flexibility for each state's circumstances. Under one scenario envisioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, states could draw on measures such as clean energy sources, carbon-trapping technology and energy efficiency to reduce the total emissions released into the air. Heather Zichal, Obama's senior energy and climate adviser, told environmental groups Monday that Obama is working with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan on a target for renewable energy to be produced at federally assisted housing projects. She framed the Obama's efforts in the U.S. as part of a broader, global movement to combat climate change, trumpeting the role the U.S. can play in leading other nations to stem the warming of the planet. Paul Bledsoe, who worked on climate issues in the Clinton White House, said Zichal renewed a pledge Obama made in in his first year in office, during global climate talks in Copenhagen, to cut U.S. carbon emissions by about 17 percent by 2020, compared to 2005 levels. ""This is a policy fulfillment of what the president has been talking about and trying to accomplish for five years or more,"" said Bledsoe, now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. One key issue Obama is not expected to address Tuesday is Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry oil extracted from tar sands in western Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast. A concerted campaign by environmental activists to persuade Obama to nix the pipeline as a ""carbon bomb"" appears to have gained little traction. The oil industry has been urging the president to approve the pipeline, citing jobs and economic benefits. Obama raised climate change as a key second-term issue in his inaugural address in January, but has offered few details since. In his February State of the Union, he issued an ultimatum to lawmakers: ""If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will."" The poor prospects for getting any major climate legislation through a Republican-controlled House were on display last week when Speaker John Boehner responded to the prospect that Obama would put forth controls on existing power plants by deeming the idea ""absolutely crazy."" ""Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs?"" said Boehner, R-Ohio, echoing the warnings of some industry groups. Sidestepping Congress by using executive action doesn't guarantee Obama smooth sailing. Lawmakers could introduce legislation to thwart Obama's efforts. And the rules for existing power plants will almost certainly face legal challenges in court. The Supreme Court has upheld the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, but how the EPA goes about that effort remains largely uncharted waters. Even if legal and political obstacles are overcome, it will take years for the new measures to be put in place, likely running up against the end of Obama's presidency or even beyond it. White House aides say that's one reason Obama is ensuring the process starts now, while there are still more than three years left in his final term. Under the process outlined in the Clean Air Act, the EPA cannot act unilaterally, but must work with states to develop the standards, said Jonas Monast, an attorney who directs the climate and energy program at Duke University. An initial proposal will be followed by a months-long public comment period before the EPA can issue final guidance to states. Then the states must create actual plans for plants within their borders, a process likely to take the better part of a year. Then the EPA has another four months to decide whether to approve each state's plan before the implementation period can start.

Hot under the collar: Study links climate change to rising tempers,"Feeling hot under the collar? It may not be all in your head. A new study connects rising world temperatures with aggressive acts of violence and even war -- but experts in the causes of war gave the report a chilly reception. For the paper, researchers analyzed 60 studies on historic empire collapses, recent wars, violent crime rates in the United States, lab simulations that tested police decisions on when to shoot and even cases where pitchers threw deliberately at batters in baseball. They found a common thread over centuries: Extreme weather  very hot or dry  means more violence. The authors say the results show strong evidence that climate can promote conflict. [pullquote] ""When the weather gets bad we tend to be more willing to hurt other people,"" said economist Solomon Hsiang of the University of California, Berkeley. He is the lead author of the study, published online Thursday by the journal Science. Experts in the causes of war gave it a mixed reception. Joshua Goldstein, a professor of international relations at American University and author of ""Winning the War on War,"" found faults with the way the study measured conflicts. He said the idea of connecting hotter tempers with hotter temperatures is only one factor in conflict, and that it runs counter to a long and large trend to less violence. ""To read this you get the impression, if climate change unfolds as we all fear it will, that the world will be beset by violent conflict and that's probably not true,"" Goldstein said. In the paper, the team of economists came up with a formula that predicts how much the risk of different types of violence should increase with extreme weather. In war-torn parts of equatorial Africa, it says, every added degree Fahrenheit or so increases the chance of conflict between groups  rebellion, war, civil unrest  by 11 percent to 14 percent. For the United States, the formula says that for every increase of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit, the likelihood of violent crime goes up 2 percent to 4 percent. Temperatures in much of North America and Eurasia are likely to go up by that 5.4 degrees by about 2065 because of increases in carbon dioxide pollution, according to a separate paper published in Science on Thursday -- although many scientists take issue with that conclusion as well. The same paper sees global averages increasing by about 3.6 degrees in the next half-century. So that implies essentially about 40 percent to 50 percent more chance for African wars than it would be without global warming, said Edward Miguel, another Berkeley economist and study co-author. When the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) updates its report next year on the impacts of global warming, it will address the issue of impacts on war for the first time, said Carnegie Institution scientist Chris Field, who heads that worldwide study group. The new study is likely to play a big role, he said. Hsiang said that whenever the analyzed studies looked at temperature and conflict, the link was clear, no matter where or when. His analysis examines about a dozen studies on collapses of empires or dynasties, about 15 studies on crime and aggression and more than 30 studies on wars, civil strife or intergroup conflicts. Goldstein noted a wide array of factors beyond climate that lead to the growth of war -- or cause hot heads to cool down. ""Because of positive changes in technology, economics, politics and health"" conflict is likely to continue to drop, he said, although maybe not as much as it would without climate change. There's a good reason why people get more aggressive in warmer weather, said Ohio State University psychology professor Brad Bushman, who wasn't part of the study but whose work on crime and heat was analyzed by Hsiang. Although people say they feel sluggish when they are hot, their heart rate and other physical responses are aroused and elevated. They think they are not agitated, when in fact they are, and ""that's a recipe for disaster,"" Bushman said. Miguel acknowledges that many other factors play a role in conflict and said it's too soon to see whether conflict from warming will outweigh peace from prosperity: ""It's a race against time.""

Leaked draft of climate report struggles with drop in warming,"An unreleased draft of the U.N.s next major climate report reportedly states that scientists are more certain than ever that mans actions are warming the planet -- even as the report struggles to explain a slow-down in warming that climate skeptics have seized upon. Global surface temperatures rose rapidly during the 70s, but have been relatively flat over the past decade and a half, according to data from the U.K.s weather-watching Met Office. Climate skeptics have spent months debating the weather pattern, some citing it as evidence that global warming itself has decelerated or even stopped. ""The absence of any significant change in the global annual average temperature over the past 16 years has become one of the most discussed topics in climate science,"" wrote David Whitehouse of the Global Warming Policy Foundation in June. ""It has certainly focused the debate about the relative importance of greenhouse gas forcing of the climate versus natural variability."" A draft of the upcoming AR5 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is set for final release in Oct. 2014 and used by governments around the world, offers a variety of explanations for the mystery, Reuters reported, from ocean storage of heat to volcanoes. [pullquote] Scientists believe causes could include: greater-than-expected quantities of ash from volcanoes, which dims sunlight; a decline in heat from the sun during a current 11-year solar cycle; more heat being absorbed by the deep oceans; or the possibility that the climate may be less sensitive than expected to a build-up of carbon dioxide, explained Reuters environment correspondent Alister Doyle. The draft expresses medium confidence that the slowing in global warming ""due in roughly equal measure"" to those factors, Reuters said. ""It might be down to minor contributions that all add up,"" said Gabriele Hegerl, a professor at Edinburgh University told the news agency. Or maybe the latest decade is simply a statistical blip, an anomaly in a larger trend. Climate bloggers were quick to dismiss all of the possible explanations for the slow down in heating up. ""All of these fatuous figures are pulled out of the air to support the IPCC ideologies and not based upon any statistical analysis or science,"" said Marc Morano, a particularly outspoken climate skeptic who writes the popular blog Climate Depot. The U.N. arm responsible for the report released a statement to FoxNews.com on Monday stating that it was premature to draw conclusions from the leaked draft. The text is likely to change in response to comments from governments received in recent weeks and will also be considered by governments and scientists at a four-day approval session at the end of September, the statement said. It is therefore premature and could be misleading to attempt to draw conclusions from it. The report stresses that scientists are now 95 percent certain that mans actions are responsible for global warming, and that action is key to avert a coming crises. The report is simply an exclamation mark on what we already knew: Climate change is real and it continues unabated, the primary cause is fossil fuel burning, and if we dont do something to reduce carbon emissions we can expect far more dangerous and potentially irreversible impacts on us, climate scientist Michael Mann wrote to Climate Progress. The U.N. agency's report is sure to face intense scrutiny. The 2007 iteration was widely lambasted over flaws and sloppy information, notably the claim that global warming would cause the Himalayas to melt by 2035.",20/08/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/science/leaked-draft-of-climate-report-struggles-with-drop-in-warming
"Climate models wildly overestimated global warming, study finds","Can you rely on the weather forecast? Maybe not, at least when it comes to global warming predictions over short time periods. Thats the upshot of a new study in the journal Nature Climate Change that compared 117 climate predictions made in the 1990's to the actual amount of warming. Out of 117 predictions, the studys author told FoxNews.com, three were roughly accurate and 114 overestimated the amount of warming. On average, the predictions forecasted two times more global warming than actually occurred. Some scientists say the study shows that climate modelers need to go back to the drawing board. ""It's a real problem ... it shows that there really is something that needs to be fixed in the climate models,"" climate scientist John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, told FoxNews.com. 'I looked at 73 climate models going back to 1979 and every single one predicted more warming than happened in the real world.' But other scientists say that's making a mountain out of a molehill. ""This is neither surprising nor particularly troubling to me as a climate scientist,"" Melanie Fitzpatrick, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told FoxNews.com. ""The work of our community is constantly to refine our understanding of the climate system and improve models based on that,"" she added. The climate models, Fitzpatrick said, will likely be correct over long periods of time. But there are too many variations in climate to expect models to be accurate over two decades. But John Christy says that climate models have had this problem going back 35 years, to 1979, the first year for which reliable satellite temperature data exists to compare the predictions to. ""I looked at 73 climate models going back to 1979 and every single one predicted more warming than happened in the real world,"" Christy said. Many of the overestimations also made their way into the popular press. In 1989, the Associate Press reported: ""Using computer models, researchers concluded that global warming would raise average annual temperatures nationwide 2 degrees by 2010."" But according to NASA, global temperature has increased by less than half that -- about 0.7 degrees Fahrenheit -- from 1989 to 2010. And in 1972, the Christian Science Monitor reported: ""Arctic specialist Bernt Balchen says a general warming trend over the North Pole is melting the polar ice cap and may produce an ice-free Arctic Ocean by the year 2000."" That also proved wrong. But people should still be concerned about global warming, Fitzpatrick says. ""The paper in no way diminishes the extensive body of observations that global warming is happening and that it is largely due to human activity,"" she added. ""Global surface temperature is still rising ... 2012 was in the top ten warmest years on record. The period 2001-2010 was the warmest on record since instrumental measurements began,"" she added. Christy agrees that there has been some warming over time, but says man-made greenhouse gasses are not as big of a driver of climate change as many think -- and that many scientists are in denial about their mistakes. ""I think in one sense the climate establishment is embarrassed by this, and so they're trying to minimize the problem,"" he said. ""The fundamental thing a climate model is supposed to predict is temperature. And yet it gets that wrong."" The study authors did not answer questions from FoxNews.com about the policy implications of their research. Why were the predictions off? The study authors list many possible reasons, from solar irradiation and incorrect assumptions about the number of volcanic eruptions to bad estimates about how CO2 effects cloud patterns. Christy said he believes the models overestimate warming because of the way they handle clouds. Most models assume that clouds shrink when there is CO2 warming, and that lets in more sun, and that's what heats up the planet  not so much the direct effect of CO2, but the feedback effect of having fewer clouds. In the real world, though, the clouds aren't shrinking, he said. The study also says that an overestimate of the power of CO2 as a greenhouse gas could be why the models over-predict, but that they do not know why the models are wrong at this point. Christy said he is not optimistic about the models being fixed. ""The Earth system is just too complex to be represented in current climate models. I dont think theyll get it right for a long time.""",12/09/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-models-wildly-overestimated-global-warming-study-finds
New study says threat of man-made global warming greatly exaggerated,"A peer-reviewed climate change study released Wednesday by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change finds the threat of man-made global warming to be not only greatly exaggerated but so small as to be embedded within the background variability of the natural climate system and not dangerous. Armed with the new findings, Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee grilled administration environmental policy officials about the economic consequences of its aggressive regulatory crackdown on the fossil fuel industry. The 1,000 page study was the work of 47 scientists and scholars examining many of the same journals and studies that the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change (UNIPCC) examined, producing entirely different conclusions. ""This volume provides the scientific balance that is missing from the overly alarmist reports from the IPCC, which are highly selective in their review of climate science,"" the authors write. The study was done under the auspices of the Heartland Institute, which claims it ""has no formal attachment to or sponsorship from any government or governmental agency."" The Heartland Institutes president, Joseph Bast, said of the study, ""The big issue in the global warming debate is how large is the human impact on climate. And this report shows that it is very small, that natural variability, the variability that's caused by natural cycles of the sun and other factors, way outweigh anything the human impact could have."" The report comes in advance of the expected release later this month of a new U.N. report on climate change. Leaked drafts of that report show surface temperature increases have been statistically insignificant for the last 15 years, and that Antarctic sea ice is increasing, not decreasing. In addition, new satellite measurements of Arctic sea ice show it has increased this year. At the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing Wednesday, Republicans particularly wanted to know what President Obama planned to do to address those fossil fuel workers who've lost their jobs as a result of administration policy. In a major address at Georgetown University last June, Obama promised there would be a special plan for those workers. ""So I would ask either one of you what are the special plans in the president's action plan to help address these people who are losing their jobs, "" Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.) asked EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. ""I'm not familiar with the details of those plans, but I am familiar from reading the climate action plan that the president sees this as both a challenge and an economic opportunity,"" McCarthy replied. That exchange led to a testy retort by Ralph Hall (R-Tex.). ""You got a better answer than I received from Mrs. McCarthy about a year ago before the science committee,"" Hall told McCarthy. ""I may have asked you a question you didn't like and your answer was, I'm not in the business of creating jobs. Committee Democrats, along with McCarthy and Moniz, set out to counter Republican skepticism about the impact of climate change. ""The evidence is overwhelming and the science is clear,"" said Moniz. ""The threat from climate change is real and urgent. The basic science behind climate change is simple. Carbon dioxide makes the earth warmer, and we are admitting more and more of it into the atmosphere."" Moniz added that any stabilization of surface temperatures in recent years was an indication of a ""hiatus"" of global warming, not an end to global warming. Told of Moniz's remarks, astrophysicist  Willy Soon, one of the NIPCC's leading scientists, reacted incredulously. ""So tell us when is it going to rise again? he asked. This is a question that not only me, as a scientist, is asking , but all the lay persons should begin asking."" The Heartland Institute's Bast told Fox News that there are no climate models used by proponents of global warming that predict a lull in warming. ""Point to the model that predicted this hiatus,"" he said. ""No increase in violent weather , no increase in hurricanes. All of this and we're still supposed to believe the models... models they picked because they supported their political interests, not because they represented good science.""",19/09/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-study-says-threat-of-man-made-global-warming-greatly-exaggerated
'Climate change' cultists vs. scientific evidence,"There is a tradition in politics that is similar to one in the legal profession: When evidence supports your position, make your argument based on the evidence, but when it argues against your position, ignore the evidence and appeal to emotion. The evidence is piling up that ""climate change,"" formerly known as ""global warming,"" is losing evidentiary support, despite recent ""preliminary findings"" by a group of ""experts"" from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that a Washington Post editorial suggests may prove, ""warming has boosted the chances, in some cases significantly, that certain unwelcome weather or weather-related disasters will occur."" The Post and other ""true believers"" ignore or ridicule a growing body of evidence rebutting their beliefs. Most bad weather -- from hurricanes, which have been few this season, to tornadoes -- are unwelcome by those in their paths, but these weather phenomena have existed for centuries. Both sides seem to agree that CO2 levels are elevated, but they don't agree on whether that will cause dangerous climate change, including rising temperatures and turbulent weather. The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) argues, ""The human effect is likely to be small relative to natural variability, and whatever small warming is likely to occur will produce benefits as well as costs."" [pullquote] Yet the climate change cultists continue to focus on melting polar ice caps and ""displaced"" polar bears as part of their emotional appeal for government to ""fix"" the problem. Now comes a report in the UK Daily Mail that ""eminent scientists"" have observed a record return of the Arctic ice cap as it grows by 60 percent in a year, covering with ice almost 1 million more square miles of ocean than in 2012. In 2007, the BBC reported that by 2013, global warming would leave the Arctic ""ice free."" Oops! Just how silly this is getting is an assertion by some activists that the current tensions in Syria might be linked to climate change. That's not as harebrained as a newspaper report in January 1933, which said, ""Yo-Yo Banned in Syria, Blamed for Drought by Moslems."" The Syrians of 1933 actually believed the up and down of a toy yo-yo affected the weather. If it went down and sprang right back up, rain. If it went down and didn't spring up, drought. Police reportedly patrolled the streets, confiscating the toy. Ridiculous? Not as ridiculous as some of the junk science coming out of climate research circles today. Last March, the Daily Mail reported that global temperatures are about to drop ""below the level that the (computer) models forecast with '90 percent certainty.'"" Marc Morano, a former staff member of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (whose web page climatedepot.com offers numerous scientific articles debunking climate change), emails me: ""As a long observer of the global weather movement, I can say that the events of 2013 (have) been one of the most devastating to the movement. Both poles have record expanding ice. Global temperatures have failed to rise for 15 plus years, sea level rise is failing to accelerate, tornadoes are at record lows, hurricanes are near record low activity ... 2013 may be the year in which man-made global warming fears enter the dustbin of history."" I doubt it. Too many people have too much invested in perpetuating this fiction. Billions of dollars and other currencies have been diverted into ""green"" projects in a Chicken Little attempt to stop the sky from falling. The BBC reports it as fact in virtually every story it does on the environment. Ditto the American media. Most media ignore evidence that counters climate change proponents. Former Vice President Al Gore has made a personal fortune promoting the cult of global warming, a cult being partially defined as a belief system that ignores proof contrary to its beliefs. Perhaps the climate change counter-revolutionaries should adopt the yo-yo as their symbol and send Gore and his apostles a box of them.

"10 things to know about the UN-sponsored panel on climate change, the IPCC","Here are 10 things to know about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.N.-sponsored scientific group that will present a landmark report on global warming Friday. ___ WHAT IS THE IPCC? A scientific body with 195 member countries, the panel was established by the U.N. in 1988 to assess the causes and impacts of climate change. Since then, it has released four assessments, each stating the human link to global warming with more certainty than the previous one. The IPCC doesn't conduct its own research, but appoints hundreds of experts to review and summarize the latest scientific studies on climate change. More than 800 scientists contributed to a report set to be released Friday. ___ WHAT REPORT? The IPCC is meeting in Stockholm this week to adopt the first of four parts of its fifth assessment report on climate change. This part deals with the physical science basis of global warming. A summary for policy-makers of about 30 pages will be published Friday, and the full 2,000-page report on Monday. Next year, the IPCC will present sections assessing the impact of climate change and strategies to fight it. A synthesis of the three reports will be adopted in October 2014. ___ SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE IPCC DOING IN STOCKHOLM? Delegates from member countries are meeting behind closed doors with authors of the physical science report to hammer out the summary for policy-makers. They are going through a draft line by line, which can be a frustratingly slow process because the text needs to be approved by consensus. Governments may have problems with the text being either too complex or too vague, or they may have non-scientific concerns about grammar or word choice. Commenting on a June draft, the U.S. wanted it to read more like a narrative. Underscoring the politics involved, China wanted to remove national borders from a world map used in the draft to ""avoid unnecessary disputes."" ___ WHAT ARE THE ASSESSMENTS USED FOR? They form the scientific basis for U.N. negotiations aimed at curbing global warming. The fifth assessment report will be a reference point for governments as they negotiate a new global climate agreement, which is supposed to be adopted by 2015 and to take effect in 2020. ___ WHAT DO CRITICS SAY ABOUT THE IPCC? Some scientists say the IPCC process is so time-consuming and laborious that by the time the assessments are published they are already out of date. Policy-makers sometimes complain that the language in the reports is too scientific and difficult for non-scientists to understand. A series of errors embarrassed the authors of the 2007 assessment, including the incorrect statement that the glaciers in the Himalayas would disappear by 2035. Climate skeptics seized on those errors as evidence the IPCC process is flawed. Supporters say the fact that such errors are so rare shows how solid the process is. There has also been criticism about the IPCC's lack of openness. ___ WHAT WILL THE NEW REPORT SAY? The final version will be adopted Friday, so changes are still possible, but leaked drafts suggest the IPCC will say it's ""extremely likely"" that climate change is man-made. That would be an upgrade from ""very likely"" in the 2007 report and would mean that scientists are now 95 percent certain of man-made warming. The report is also expected to raise the projections of sea level rise this century and analyze the human contributions to the loss of Arctic sea ice, which hit a new record in summer last year, and the retreat of glaciers and ice sheets. The June draft projected that surface temperatures will rise by 0.3-4.8 degrees C (0.5-8.6 F) this century, depending in part on whether and how much countries reduce their CO2 emissions. ___ HOW ACCURATE ARE THE IPCC'S PROJECTIONS? The IPCC makes long-term projections about how the climate system will respond to warming temperatures over the next decades so we won't know just how accurate they are until the evidence is in at the end of this century. Scientists generally agree that the assessments offer the best available estimates of future warming, and the projections are based on a solid understanding of the factors at play in the climate system. But they also stress that there are uncertainties involved, just like knowledge about financial markets doesn't mean you will be able to predict the stock market. ___ WHAT DOES THE IPCC SAY ABOUT THE RECENT 'HIATUS' IN WARMING? When climate scientists talk about global warming they refer to the rise in global temperatures observed in the past 100 years or so. They typically don't pay much attention to shorter time scales in which temperatures can go up or down in natural climate fluctuations. But there's been so much media attention recently to a purported slowdown in the temperature rise in the past 15 years that many governments want the IPCC to address it in the report. Some skeptics claim this ""hiatus"" shows that global warming has stopped, even though if you compare decadal averages, the previous decade was the warmest on record. It's an area that needs more research, but many scientists say the purported slowdown reflects random climate fluctuations and an unusually hot year, 1998, picked as a starting point for charting temperatures. Another leading hypothesis is that heat is settling temporarily in the oceans. ___ WHO HEADS THE IPCC? Rajendra Pachauri, a scientist from India, has been the chairman of the IPCC since 2002. He is set to step down when his term expires in 2015. ___ WHERE IS THE IPCC BASED? The secretariat of the IPCC is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, in the offices of the World Meteorological Organization, the U.N.'s weather agency.",26/09/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/world/10-things-to-know-about-the-un-sponsored-panel-on-climate-change-the-ipcc
"UN's new climate change report an embarrassment, self-serving and beyond misleading","Friday, the world was treated to the latest, greatest report on global warming from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the form of its Fifth Assessment Report. It is an embarrassment of internal inconsistency, entirely self-serving, and is beyond misleading. Thats because the IPCC is more intent on maintaining the crumbling consensus on global warming than on following climate science to its logical conclusion; a conclusion that increasingly suggests that human greenhouse gas emissions are less important in driving climate change than commonly held. Thats right, the latest climate science (some 10 studies published in just the past 3 years) indicates that the earths climate sensitivitythat is, how much the global average surface temperature will rise as a result of greenhouse gases emitted from human activitiesis some 33 percent less than scientists thought at the time of the last IPCC Assessment, published in 2007. A little climate 101: climate sensitivity is one of the key parameters for understanding the future impacts from climate change. [pullquote] Virtually all elements of climate are related in some way to changes in the earths average temperature. The less the earth warms up, the fewer the resulting impacts, and the lower the urgency to try to do something to alleviate them. Meaning, initiatives like President Obamas Climate Action Planthe motivation for such things as the EPAs just-announced effective moratorium on future coal-fired power plantswould be even more unnecessary and ineffective than they are already. The IPCC is not altogether blind to the new scientific findings indicating a lower climate sensitivity, but it barely pays them lip-service in its new report. It cant. Why? The meat of the new IPCC report  and the part that politicians predominantly look to for new legislation   is its projections of future climate change. The problem is that the climate models the IPCC relies upon to produce these projections have a climate sensitivity that averages some 50 percent higher than what the latest science suggests. This means that the IPCCs projections of future climate change and the resulting impacts are nearly twice as large as they likely should be. In other words, the models dont work. The IPCC cant very well admit to the fact that observations say one thing, but the climate models say another. If they did, they would have to throw out virtually the whole report. But just because the IPCC doesnt admit to it, doesnt mean that the rest of the world doesnt know it to be true. It is increasingly obvious that the earths average temperature over the past several decades has refused to warm up at the rate foretold by these climate models. In fact, there has been no clear large-scale surface warming for more than 16 years now, and a new paper published earlier this month in the prestigious journal Nature Climate Change affirms the climate models inability to correctly simulate these observations. So we have a situation in which the latest science on two key issues: how much the earth will warm as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions, and how well climate models perform in projecting the warming, is largely not incorporated into the new IPCC report. In this manner, the IPCC misleads policymakers around the world. The IPCCs exaggerated projections are the root of fears of coming climate disaster (sinking cities, storm-ravaged coastlines, widespread famine, etc.)fears that result in calls to limit our use of fossil fuels used to produce the energy that supports human society and feeds innovation. If mankind is to contemplate such a major undertaking with the attached risk that it drives the human condition backward, shouldnt the basis be something other than an IPCC report that is obsolete and counterfactual on the day of its release? Instead of laboring to try to uphold a consensus that was tenuous from the outset, and which is now outdated, the IPCC should be striving to produce a summary of the contemporary bank of scientific knowledge. Only with that type of information can responsible decisions pertaining to the development of worlds energy sources be made.",27/09/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/uns-new-climate-change-report-an-embarrassment-self-serving-and-beyond-misleading
UN climate change report dismisses slowdown in global warming,"The Earth has changed in unprecedented ways since 1950, the U.N. says, and its scientists are 95 percent certain that humans are responsible. Yet the planet has largely stopped warming over the past 15 years, data shows -- and a landmark report released Friday by the U.N.s climate group could not explain why the mercury has stopped rising. Global surface temperatures rose rapidly during the 70s, but have been relatively flat over the past decade and a half, rising only 0.05 degrees Celsius (0.09 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade according to data from the U.K.s weather-watching Met Office, a trend current models of the worlds climate have been unable to predict. A draft of the report leaked in early September acknowledged that trend and put it bluntly: We simply cant explain it. Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 1015 years. But a final version of the report released Friday morning by the U.N.s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) strips out the failure of models and explains away the downward trend. [pullquote] Due to natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends, the new report reads. A later reference suggests volcanoes, oceans and solar activity may have affected the warming, although the IPCC said it wasn't confident in that finding. The U.N. arm also acknowledges another possibility: Maybe it was wrong. ""There may also be ... an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing,"" the new report admits. Climate skeptics have seized upon the change in world weather patterns, some citing it as evidence that global warming itself has decelerated or even stopped. Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said the slowdown was a far larger issue than the report shows. Unless global temperature will begin to rise again in the next few years, the IPCC is very likely going to suffer an existential blow to its credibility, he said. Judith Curry, professor and chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, was even blunter. IPCC has thrown down the gauntlet  if the pause continues beyond 15 years (well it already has), they are toast. Many governments had objections over how the issue was treated in earlier drafts and some had called for it to be deleted altogether. In a Friday morning presentation of its findings, Thomas Stocker, co-chair of the group that wrote the report, defended that decision, the Associated Press reported. ""An old rule says that climate-relevant trends should not be calculated for periods less than around 30 years,"" Stocker said. Many scientists say the slowdown reflects random climate fluctuations and an unusually hot year, 1998, picked as a starting point for charting temperatures. Another leading hypothesis is that heat is settling temporarily in the oceans. Stocker said there wasn't enough literature on ""this emerging question."" The IPCC said the evidence of climate change has grown thanks to more and better observations, a clearer understanding of the climate system and improved models to analyze the impact of rising temperatures. ""Our assessment of the science finds that the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amount of snow and ice has diminished, the global mean sea level has risen and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,"" said Qin Dahe, co-chair of the working group that wrote the report. Yet recent reports have stressed that climate models have failed to accurately predict global temperatures. A study in the journal Nature Climate Change compared 117 climate predictions made in the 1990's to the actual amount of warming. Out of 117 predictions, the studys author told FoxNews.com, 3 were roughly accurate and 114 overestimated the amount of warming. On average, the predictions forecasted two times more global warming than actually occurred. ""It's a real problem ... it shows that there really is something that needs to be fixed in the climate models,"" climate scientist John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, told FoxNews.com at the time.",27/09/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/science/un-climate-change-report-dismisses-slowdown-in-global-warming
"Climate change warnings -- science or ""scientific-sounding""?","I've studied climate and its effects on lifeall kinds of life ---for more than four decades, starting in 1968. Along the way, among other things, I developed a computer model of forests that in the 1990s we used to forecast the effects of climate on jack pine forests in Michigan that were the only habitat of the endangered Kirtlands warbler.  A lot of effort was going into saving the birds habitat, and I wondered if, with global warming, it might all be in vain. As a result I'm one of the reviewers of sections of the latest report on climate change and its impact by the United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the first part of which was released last week in the form of a general summary for policymakers. I had some serious concerns about the sections of the much bigger report that I reviewed  which hasn't yet been released---and I have some of the same reservations about the document that was published last week. [pullquote] My biggest concern about the climate report is that it presents a number of speculative, and sometimes incomplete, conclusions embedded in  language that gives them more scientific heft than they deserve. The report, in other words, is ""scientific-sounding,"" rather than clearly settled and based on indisputable fact.  Established facts about the global environment exist less often in science than laymen usually think. The authors interpose a layer of opinion disguised as fact through their use of a language of ""high confidence"" and lesser degrees of that, and levels of certainty ranging from unlikely to certain. What do these confidence levels and unlikely to virtually certain levels mean? The report states that confidence is based on mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment, and that certainty levels can also be based just on expert judgment.   The fact is, science doesn't work like that.  I cant think of any major scientific advances that were put in these terms as a key way to evaluate them. Equally  important, the just published summary does not show where its data came from it refers to a box and chapter 1"" of the full report, which arent available now.  This makes it all the tougher to evaluate the language of high confidence"" etc., which, in the end, papers over whether the material is truly based on science or not. For example, the report states that on a global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface. Either this is a truism (the sun must be heating the ocean surface first) or it is meant to take into account the complex circulations that occur in the ocean, like the Gulf Streams involvement in a vertical rise of waters from deep ocean layers in one region and sinking of the cooled surface waters as the stream reaches its northern limit. The report would be more meaningful if it made a straightforward statement about the measuring methods and data on which this conclusion is based. The fact that it doesn't may make it easier for non-scientists to repeat the generalization, but it obscures what this debate needs most:  transparency about methods, and clarity about facts. Indeed, the reports language appears to be sometimes coupled with a selective reading or oversimplification of the facts, so that the authors have ""high confidence"" in something that is not the whole story. For example, they state that over the past two decades, Arctic sea ice cover has continued to decrease in extent (high confidence). But in 2010 I co-authored  a paper with two sea ice experts and a historian/ethnologist in which we used nineteenth-century records from whaling ships hunting bowhead whales in the north Pacific and beyond, along the Arctic sea ice edge. We compared 23,000 days of observations in those records with late twentieth-century observations, and concluded that the extent of the sea ice at the end of winter was pretty much the same in the nineteenth and late twentieth century, but that the end-of-summer Arctic sea ice retreat is greater today than it was then.  These kinds of more subtle findings could make a big difference in ones level of confidence."" The reports heavy dependence on existing climate models creates further problems. Models, like all scientific theory, have to be tested against real-world observations. Physicists still continually try to test Einsteins theory of relativity as new opportunities arise, even though it was first published in 1916. The theory has cleared test after test, but researchers keep trying to find its limits and thereby also the limits of its applications. The most recent test of relativity took place in 2013. Scientists call such tests validation.  Experts in model validation say that the climate models frequently cited in the IPCC report are little if any validated.  This means that as theory they are fundamentally scientifically unproven. Many versions of climate models are in use, but they are all based on the same theory. We do not have competing theories, just competing variations of one theory. As a result, the current report can confuse a reader even more as to what is fact and what is speculation based on poorly validated models. This is another way that opinion is hidden under what is called science; it is theory untested and therefore not by itself science.  A more powerful science would involve strongly different ways of approaching theory, to see which accounted for more observations.  And following the standard scientific rule called Occams Razor, we would go with the simplest model that accounted for the same data as a more complex one. The bigger problem is that when it comes to climate, models have become our new reality, rather than something we test and discard when reality brings their weakness to our attention.  Because global environmental data are generally so sparse and have not been gathered comprehensively for long, the tendency is to believe the models as our truth. This will be to our disadvantage. Having worked for decades on climate change and its possible effects on life, I come away from the just published ""summary for policymakers"" believing that it does not allow a scientist, let alone a policymaker, to decide that we are, or are not, creating a global warming. As a result, I foresee two dangers. One is that it will simply  intensify the political, ideological and, yes, moral debate that has erupted over who does and does not believe we are causing global warming, and thus move us even farther from the important scientific effort that the issue deserves. The second danger may be even worse: it reinforces the belief that there is some kind of climate normality, usually characterized as existing earlier in the twentieth century or before the Industrial Revolution (but after the Little Ice Age, which lasted from approximately the mid-1400s to 1700) that is desirable, even necessary, for our species and for the ecology of the planet. In fact, there has never been such a thing, which is one of the reasons that biological evolution and adaptation exist in the first place. As I discuss in my book ""The Moon in the Nautilus Shell,"" only by using nature's dynamics as a guide, rather than  best-guess, sweeping  climate models, will we understand the naturalness of change, and thereby conserve the biodiversity of life on Earth---that is, for millions of species, including our own.",30/09/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-warnings-science-or-scientific-sounding
Balance is not bias -- Fox News critics mislead public on climate change,"In George Orwells novel, ""1984,"" the totalitarian state (Big Brother) demands blind belief in falsehoods that literally stand the truth on its head: War Is Peace, Ignorance Is Strength, and Freedom Is Slavery. If Orwell were alive and could observe todays climate debate, he might have to add another inversion to the litany of deception: Balance Is Bias. In a recent column in The Guardian, climate activists John Abraham and Dana Nuccitelli claim that Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, and other conservative media provide false balance by featuring climate contrarians. By disproportionately representing climate skeptics in their global warming coverage, Abraham and Nuccitelli argue, conservative media foster the illusion of scientific controversy and hide from the public a near-universal scientific consensus. [pullquote] This criticism is a big fat empty suit. It is Abraham and Nuccitelli who mislead the public by misrepresenting what the climate debate is about. Abraham and Nuccitelli site Cook et al (2013), a study co-authored by Nuccitelli, which allegedly finds that 97% of climate scientists agree with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that most of the 0.7C of global warming since 1951 is due to man-made greenhouse gases. Skeptics, they suggest, are a fringe element, unworthy of media attention. But the Cook study does not really prove what it claims to prove. The authors examined 11,944 abstracts of climate papers published between 1991-2011. They found that nearly two-thirds of the abstracts expressed no opinion on the supposed consensus position. So their headline  97% of scientists agree  is inaccurate and misleading. IN 1984-speak, they are claiming Silence is Affirmation. Of the abstracts that expressed an opinion, Cook et al. claim that 97.1% (less than one-third of the original total) agree with the IPCC consensus position. But that too is a stretcher. University of Delaware Prof. David Legates and three colleagues examined the Cook teams database, and found that less than 1% of the 11,944 abstracts explicitly endorse the so-called consensus. Is the 97% figure made up out of whole cloth? Not quite. It turns out that 97% of about one-third of the abstracts affirms or implies that humans are responsible for some portion of global warming since 1951. And guess what? Just about every prominent skeptic  agrees with that as well. As an attempt to discredit contrarians, the Cook study is a bust. The key science question for climate researchers today is not whether greenhouse gas emissions warm the planet but whether state-of-the-art computer models are accurate enough to forecast climate change and inform policy decisions. As it turns out, the IPCCs latest ensemble of climate models produce estimates that overshoot the warming of the past 20 years by 100% and of the last 15 years by 300%. Skeptics have been pointing out the growing mismatch between models and observations for years. But if not for contrarian blogs like Watts Up With That and conservative outlets like Fox News, how would the general public ever know? The key science question for citizens and their representatives is not whether most recent warming is man-made but whether climate change, as Al Gore HAS put it, is a planetary emergency . . . that threatens the survival of civilization and the habitability of the Earth. As I showed on this site last week, the latest IPCC report  the Bible of consensus climatology  implicitly disavows Gores doomsday scenarios. Finally, the key issue for policymakers is not whether climate change poses risks but whether the proposed solutions  carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, and other schemes to rig the market against plentiful, affordable, reliable fossil fuels  would do more harm than good. Many scientists think green pressure groups and the IPCC exaggerate the perils of climate change, and many experts regard cap-and-trade and the like as a cure worse than the alleged disease. Thus, contrary to Abraham and Nuccitelli, the division amongst climate experts is real and substantial. Perhaps Abraham and Nuccitelli are frustrated by the inability of 20 years of climate treaty negotiations to slow the growth in global carbon dioxide emissions. But that failure is due to economic and technological realities, not faulty perceptions of climatology. For decades the climate alarm movement has been pushing solutions that would handicap fossil fuels rather than make alternative energy more competitive  that is, cheaper without costly subsidies. With global energy demand rapidly increasing, especially in developing countries where millions still live in poverty, the green agenda has been a dead end from day one. What amazes is that Abraham and Nuccitelli still pin their hopes on the cult of consensus. Forging an inter-governmental consensus has been the IPCCs mission for 25 years, unavoidably politicizing climate science in the process. It has long since begun to backfire. People get suspicious when government-appointed experts define the science for the purpose of advancing an agenda that just happens to increase government control of energy markets. Abraham and Nuccitelli have learned nothing if they think that demanding even greater fealty to groupthink will do anything except energize skeptics and increase their popularity. The good news is that conservative media are not going to take their advice, because doing so would allow one faction of experts to monopolize the discussion. Scores of government agencies, hundreds of mainstream media outlets, and thousands of Web sites serve up daily diets of climate alarm. Presenting contrarian analysis and commentary is balance, not bias.",16/10/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/balance-is-not-bias-fox-news-critics-mislead-public-on-climate-change
A glance at coal and its role in climate change,"Coal took center stage in the global warming debate on Monday as a high-profile coal industry event kicked off on the sidelines of a U.N. climate conference in Warsaw. Environmental activists were outraged, saying coal is the problem, not the solution to climate change. Poland, which is presiding over both conferences, says the coal industry needs to be part of the climate discourse because a lot of coal-reliant countries  Poland included  will depend on the fossil fuel for a long time. Here are some quick facts about coal and the carbon pollution the world is releasing by burning it: WHAT IS COAL? Coal is a fossil fuel that formed over time from the remains of plants that died millions of years ago. It contains energy that those plants once absorbed from the sun. WHY DO SOME PEOPLE CALL IT A ""DIRTY"" FUEL? Apart from being a major contributor to emissions of CO2, the most important greenhouse gas, coal is a leading cause of smog, acid rain and air pollution. Governments have been trying to manage the environmental impact of coal burning ever since smoke pollution became a major problem in English cities in the 19th century. HOW MUCH CO2 EMISSIONS COME FROM COAL? Of all energy sources, coal is the dirtiest in terms of carbon pollution. In 2011, about 44 percent of total energy emissions came from coal, compared to 35 percent from oil and just over 20 percent from natural gas, according to the International Energy Agency. HOW CAN YOU REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM COAL? U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres offered one alternative Monday: leave the coal in the ground. But the reality is a lot of countries with coal resources are not ready to give it up as an energy source. Instead, they are looking for ways to reduce emissions by improving the efficiency of coal-fired plants or adopting technologies that trap the CO2 for storage underground. These technologies are expensive and have so far not been put to widespread use. IF COAL IS SO DIRTY WHY ARE WE STILL BURNING IT? Since the industrial revolution coal has been a double-edged sword for humanity, powering economic growth while polluting the environment. Even now that the climate impact is known, coal-reliant countries are reluctant to give it up, fearing it would hurt their economies. Even though China  the world's biggest carbon polluter  is investing in renewable energy, its coal use is also rising because of the huge demand for energy as its economy expands, lifting millions of people out of poverty. WHO BURNS THE MOST COAL? China is the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal. Coal accounted for 68 percent Chinese energy consumption in 2012, according to the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research, Oslo. The U.S. also is a top coal producer, but domestic coal use is declining as some power plants have switched to lower-priced natural gas.",18/11/2013,https://www.foxnews.com/world/a-glance-at-coal-and-its-role-in-climate-change
Critics blast Reddit over climate-change skeptic ban,"Critics are slamming Reddit over a single moderator's decision to ban climate-change skeptics from contributing to its science forum, attacking the move as political censorship. In an op-ed titled Reddits science forum banned climate deniers. Why dont all newspapers do the same? Nathan Allen -- who described himself a Ph.D. chemist for a major chemical company and a moderator on Reddits /r/science forum -- explained his decision to wipe comments from some users he dismissed as problematic. These people were true believers, blind to the fact that their arguments were hopelessly flawed, the result of cherry-picked data and conspiratorial thinking, Allen said in his article, which is posted on Grist.org. They had no idea that the smart-sounding talking points from their preferred climate blog were, even to a casual climate science observer, plainly wrong. Allen went on to attack climate-change skeptics further, saying that evidence to support their position simply does not exist and that such people are enamored by the emotionally charged and rhetoric-based arguments of pundits on talk radio and Fox News. '[Climate skeptics are] enamored by the emotionally charged ... arguments of pundits on talk radio and Fox News.' Finally, Allen called for other news outlets to follow his example, asking if a half-dozen volunteers can keep a page with more than 4 million users from being a microphone for the antiscientific, is it too much to ask for newspapers to police their own editorial pages as proficiently? The move has drawn accusations of hypocrisy, as Reddit claims to be a haven for free speech and debate. The site describes itself as a place friendly to thought, relationships, arguments, and to those that wish to challenge those genres. Brendan ONeill, in a blog post for the UK Daily Telegraph, said Reddit has ripped its own reputation to shreds, and described the move as political censorship, designed to silence the expression of dissent about climate-change alarmism on one of the Internets most popular user-generated forums. James Delingpole, columnist, climate skeptic and author of The Little Green Book Of Eco Fascism, was even louder in his criticism. The greenies -- and their many useful idiots in the liberal media -- are terrified of open debate on climate-change because the real world evidence long ago parted company with their scientifically threadbare theory, Delingpole told FoxNews.com, arguing that Allens tactic is part of a classic liberal defense mechanism: If the facts don't support you, then close down the argument. Victoria Taylor, Reddits director of communications, told FoxNews.com that while it was Allens prerogative to ban climate-change skeptics from /r/science, his statements do not reflect the views of Reddit as a whole, or other science or climate-oriented subreddits. Each subreddit community is entitled to its own views, and anyone who wants to start their own subreddit is welcome to do so devoted to their views, opinions or interests, Taylor said. While there is a subreddit dedicated to climate skeptics, it has far less research than the larger science board. The move follows an October decision by Paul Thornton -- the letters section editor for the Los Angeles Times -- who said he wouldnt publish some letters from those skeptical of mans role in the planets warming climate, saying that denying climate-change is not stating an opinion, its asserting a factual inaccuracy. Kelly McBride, who studies media ethics and is a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute, defended the LA Times decision, telling FoxNews.com in November she was all in favor of Thornton refusing skeptics. One of our ethical imperatives as journalists is to speak the truth, McBride said. And when we constantly allow people to say things that are known falsehoods, we undermine the public perception and the facts of an issue. Its not like we in society want these voices to go away, she said. We just want them in proper tone and context. Allens climate-change comments are not the first time that Reddits moderation has been the subject of controversy. Earlier this year Reddits /r/politics forum banned a variety of sites, including Fox Nation, Huffington Post and National Review, in what it claimed was a move to avoid sensationalized headlines and bad journalism.

Secretary of State Kerry lashes out at climate change skeptics,"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday called climate change perhaps the world's ""most fearsome"" destructive weapon and mocked those who deny its existence or question its causes, comparing them to people who insist the Earth is flat. In a speech to Indonesian students, civic leaders and government officials, Kerry tore into climate change skeptics. He accused them of using shoddy science and scientists to delay steps needed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at the risk of imperiling the planet. A day earlier, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to cooperate more closely on combating climate change. American officials hope that will help encourage others, including developing countries like Indonesia and India, to follow suit. China and the United States are the biggest sources of emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause the atmosphere to trap solar heat and alter the climate. Scientists say such changes are leading to drought, wildfires, rising sea levels, melting polar ice, plant and animal extinctions and other extreme conditions. Also in the Jakarta speech, Kerry said everyone and every country must take responsibility for the problem and act immediately. ""We simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation,"" he said, referring to what he called ""big companies"" that ""don't want to change and spend a lot of money"" to act to reduce the risks. Kerry later singled out major oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders. ""We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts,"" Kerry told the audience at a U.S. Embassy-run American Center in a shopping mall. ""Nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits."" ""The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand,"" Kerry said. ""We don't have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society,"" Kerry said the cost of inaction will far outweigh the significant expense of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that trap solar heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the Earth's rising temperatures. He outlined a litany of recent weather disasters, particularly flooding and typhoons in Asia, and their impact on commerce, agriculture, fishing and daily living conditions for billions of people. ""This city, this country, this region, is really on the front lines of climate change,"" Kerry said. ""It's not an exaggeration to say that your entire way of life here is at risk."" He added: ""In a sense, climate change can now be considered the world's largest weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even, the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction."" The solution, Kerry said, is a new global energy policy that shifts reliance from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies. He noted the President Barack Obama is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to their leaders to join. The U.S.-China statement issued just after Kerry left Beijing on Saturday said the two countries agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse gases, including reducing vehicle emissions, improving energy efficiency of buildings and other measures. Beijing and Washington launched a climate change discussion last year, promising progress in five areas: reducing vehicle emissions; advanced electric power grids; capturing and storing carbon emissions; gathering greenhouse gas data; and building efficiency. Kerry was in Indonesia on the last leg of a three-nation tour of Asia that started in South Korea. After leaving Indonesia on Monday, he planned to visit Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Before the climate change speech, Kerry toured Jakarta's Istiqlal Mosque, one of the largest in the world, to pay his respects to Indonesia's Muslim majority population.",16/02/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/secretary-of-state-kerry-lashes-out-at-climate-change-skeptics
Debate over climate change gets heated,"This is a rush transcript from ""Special Report,"" February 14, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Let's make clear, no single episode of weather, no storm, no flood, no drought, can be said to have been caused by climate change, global climate change. But the science is clear that weather practically everywhere is being influenced by climate change. MARK MORANO, CLIMATE DEPOT: The problem with runaway global temperature is we're going on 17 years with no global warming. And to put that in very simple terms, every high school kid today has not experienced global warming. Every elementary school kid today has only experienced a slight global cooling. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCKELWAY: Two views about global warming, never shall the twain meet.  This as the president just touched down in the San Joaquin Valley of California. That's a part of California that not a lot of Americans know a lot about. It is not Hollywood, not San Francisco, but we all depend on it. That's where most of our food comes from. Something like 50 percent of the world's agricultural products come from that valley, which is undergoing a tremendous drought right now, some, including the president, say caused by global warming. Let's bring in the panel right now, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, Juan Williams, columnist with The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Thanks, gentleman. Steve, let's start with you. The president making this proposal in California for a creation of a climate resilience fund to help the communities prepare for the effects of climate change, a $1 billion fund.  Using this for his own advantage to advance the climate change agenda? STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: No question, and you would expect the president to do that. But I think he and climate change proponents will have to grapple with the central fact, which I think Mark Morano laid out. There hasn't been an appreciable change, increase in global climate temperatures in 17 years. The smart climate change proponents or activists will acknowledge that and say this presents a problem for the argument that we've been making over several years, and it's something that we've got to explain and grapple with. But there aren't that many, I think, intellectually honest global climate activists, most of them are not, just choosing to ignore that and sort of shrug it off. But that is the central fact. If you're seeing increased concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon-related pollutants, and not seeing another increase at the same level of global temperature, then you have a problem. MCKELWAY: Juan? WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think there should be a political argument, but it's become a political argument because so many people say, hey, you know, where is the basis for this? Look how the temperatures, for example, are so cold this winter right here in Washington. We had a cold winter. I was joking with some friends the other day, I said, I came outside, it's pretty balmy. The temperature is 32. I guess it changes. Anyway, I think the problem here is language, to a large extent. Clearly, there is global climate change going on. If you ask a scientists, the people at the national academy of sciences, you ask the people at NASA, what they present to you is not 17 years, as we heard in the clip, Doug. Instead what they talk about is 100-plus years where you can see the trends, the patterns. And what you see is more extremes, colder temperatures as well as warmer temperatures. And what we're seeing in that Fresno, San Joaquin valley area, is I think a drought that is more extreme than anything they have seen in decades. MCKELWAY: Charles, Juan has said this has become politicized. Is it fair to assume that the science of climatology has been politicized in academia as has the rest of academia? CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, absolutely. But it's more than political. It's become a kind of religion. The essence of a scientific theory is that you can in principle refute it with empirical evidence, otherwise it's religion, it's a belief. And whatever happens, whether it's cold or warm, whether it's a flood or drought, whether it's pestilence or locusts or any of the plagues, it's always climate change.  So if it proves everything, it proves nothing. It's sort of the essence of the denial of scientific rigor. And you know, we've now heard over the last week yet another example, apart from the drought in the West, is the snowmageddon in the East, eight inches of snow in the East Coast. I have an explanation that is not climate change. It's called winter, and it happened every year. It's happened every year for a long time. And to me, it's just plain cynicism to seize upon any event and then to use it as an example of a theory, which is not a way to prove it. And this billion dollars, this attenuation fund, it is going to be exactly like the money that was spent on green energy. It is a slush fund for crony capitalism that will go to favored individuals and companies.  It's going to apparently ameliorate the damage from natural events caused by climate change. Well, which drought is climate change? Which flood is climate change? There's no way to adjudicate that. It will be political, as Juan was saying  the essence is political -- and ultimately, it will be corrupt. MCKELWAY: You described believers as, looking at this as a religion.  Michael Crichton, the great novelists wrote about this eloquently, describing how there's an initial Eden, a paradise, a state of grace, a unity with nature, and then we fall from grace by virtue of taking a bite of the forbidden fruit, technology, and we fall into pollution and all seek redemption because judgment day is coming. You want to tackle that, Juan? WILLIAMS: I don't know how -- I think Michael Crichton actually became a doubter, and Michael Crichton -- KRAUTHAMMER: And was ostracized because of that in Hollywood. WILLIAMS: I don't know about that part, but I know he became a doubter, as Doug was just reading. My sense is that Michael Crichton was questioning the whole idea because there is such an overwhelming judgment by the scientific community. Today, I was noticing. MCKELWAY: That gets to the point of funding, because critics say it's only because they're getting the funding. WILLIAMS: Look, I think funding is a big issue these days in a period of austerity in general, but 97 percent, that's what the National Academy - - it's not made up. It's what the government says. It's not political.  That's what 97 percent of climate scientists say we are experiencing -- HAYES: Who did the survey? There is no such survey. WILLIAMS: There is. It's the National Academy of Science. HAYES: There is no such survey. The California example I hear is actually very interesting because what you have is a government that is, because of the Endangered Species Act, has turned off pumps that send water from the Sacramento Delta down south and help provide water for the rest of California. Those pumps have been in effect, on and off a little bit, but basically turned off since 2007. In 2010, it was one of the wettest years on record in California. That water that would have been captured in 2010 could have continued to provide water to California for those intervening years and continuing to this day. And we wouldn't be looking at this as a kind of crisis that it may turn into. And they're doing this to protect this delta smelt, and all in the name of protecting this small little bait fish they have in effect redone California and its water. And I spoke with Congressman Devin Nunez before I came on tonight, and he said that the government kills more smelt looking for smelt than the pumps kill. (CROSSTALK) MCKELWAY: -- to try to re-create new places for salmon, which is their ancestral homeland, apparently  there are some rivers in Northern California. More water being diverted, Charles. KRAUTHAMMER: Look in the end, all the remedies that they talk about, Obama and the others, especially the EPA wants to shut down U.S. coal because it puts carbon in the atmosphere, is utterly useless. The United States is six percent of the population of the world, with India and China and the other tigers in the third world developing, spewing carbon into the atmosphere, no matter what is done here, will have zero effect on climate. And that's why even if you accept all of the climate science, all of it, there is nothing that we can do unilaterally in the U.S. other than destroy our own economy. MCKELWAY: Out of time, gentleman.

Greenpeace co-founder: No scientific proof humans are dominant cause of warming climate,"A co-founder of Greenpeace told lawmakers there is no evidence man is contributing to climate change, and said he left the group when it became more interested in politics than the environment. Patrick Moore, a Canadian ecologist and business consultant who was a member of Greenpeace from 1971-86, told members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee environmental groups like the one he helped establish use faulty computer models and scare tactics in promoting claims man-made gases are heating up the planet. There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earths atmosphere over the past 100 years, he said. Even if the planet is warming up, Moore claimed it would not be calamitous for men, which he described as a subtropical species. Skeptics of manmade climate change say there is no evidence the Earth is warming. A UN report on the scientific data behind global warming released in September indicated that global surface temperatures have not increased for the past 15 years, but scientists who believe climate change due to man is occurring say it has merely paused because of several factors and will soon resume. The 2,200-page new Technical Report attributes that to a combination of several factors, including natural variability, reduced heating from the sun and the ocean acting like a heat sink to suck up extra warmth in the atmosphere. Moore said he left Greenpeace in the 1980s because he believed it became more interested in politics than science. After 15 years in the top committee I had to leave as Greenpeace took a sharp turn to the political left, and began to adopt policies that I could not accept from my scientific perspective, he said. Climate change was not an issue when I abandoned Greenpeace, but it certainly is now.",26/02/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/science/greenpeace-co-founder-no-scientific-proof-humans-are-dominant-cause-of-warming-climate
UN says 2013 'extreme' weather events due to human-induced climate change,"Much of the extreme weather that wreaked havoc in Asia, Europe and the Pacific region last year can be blamed on human-induced climate change, the U.N. weather agency says. The World Meteorological Organization's annual assessment Monday said 2013 was the sixth-warmest year on record. Thirteen of the 14 warmest years have occurred in the 21st century. A rise in sea levels is leading to increasing damage from storm surges and coastal flooding, as demonstrated by Typhoon Haiyan, the agency's Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said. The typhoon in November killed at least 6,100 people and caused $13 billion in damage to the Philippines and Vietnam. Australia, meanwhile, had its hottest year on record. ""Many of the extreme events of 2013 were consistent with what we would expect as a result of human-induced climate change,"" Jarraud said. He also cited other costly weather disasters such as $22 billion damage from central European flooding in June, $10 billion in damage from Typhoon Fitow in China and Japan, and a $10 billion drought in much of China. Only a few places -- including the central U.S.  --were cooler than normal last year, but 2013 had no El Nino, the warming of the central Pacific that happens once every few years and changes rain and temperature patterns around the world. Jarraud spoke as top climate scientists and representatives from about 100 governments with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change met in Japan to complete their latest report on global warming's impact on hunger, disease, drought, flooding, refugees and war. Speaking in Geneva, Jarraud drew special attention to studies and climate modeling examining Australia's recent heat waves, saying the high temperatures there would have been virtually impossible without the emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas. ""It is not possible to reproduce these heat waves in the models if you don't take into account human influence,"" he said.",24/03/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-says-2013-extreme-weather-events-due-to-human-induced-climate-change.amp
New UN report warns humans more vulnerable than ever to effects of climate change,"If the world doesn't cut pollution of heat-trapping gases, the already noticeable harms of global warming could spiral ""out of control,"" the head of a United Nations scientific panel warned Monday. And he's not alone. The Obama White House says it is taking this new report as a call for action, with Secretary of State John Kerry saying ""the costs of inaction are catastrophic."" Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that issued the 32-volume, 2,610-page report here early Monday, told The Associated Press: ""it is a call for action."" Without reductions in emissions, he said, impacts from warming ""could get out of control."" One of the study's authors, Maarten van Aalst, a top official at the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said, ""If we don't reduce greenhouse gases soon, risks will get out of hand. And the risks have already risen."" Twenty-first century disasters such as killer heat waves in Europe, wildfires in the United States, droughts in Australia and deadly flooding in Mozambique, Thailand and Pakistan highlight how vulnerable humanity is to extreme weather, according to the report from the Nobel Prize-winning group of scientists. The dangers are going to worsen as the climate changes even more, the report's authors said. ""We're now in an era where climate change isn't some kind of future hypothetical,"" said the overall lead author of the report, Chris Field of the Carnegie Institution for Science in California. ""We live in an area where impacts from climate change are already widespread and consequential."" Nobody is immune, Pachauri and other scientists said. ""We're all sitting ducks,"" Princeton University professor Michael Oppenheimer, one of the main authors of the report, said in an interview. After several days of late-night wrangling, more than 100 governments unanimously approved the scientist-written 49-page summary -- which is aimed at world political leaders. The summary mentions the word ""risk"" an average of about 5 1/2 times per page. ""Changes are occurring rapidly and they are sort of building up that risk,"" Field said. These risks are both big and small, according to the report. They are now and in the future. They hit farmers and big cities. Some places will have too much water, some not enough, including drinking water. Other risks mentioned in the report involve the price and availability of food, and to a lesser and more qualified extent some diseases, financial costs and even world peace. ""Things are worse than we had predicted"" in 2007, when the group of scientists last issued this type of report, said report co-author Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development at the Independent University in Bangladesh. ""We are going to see more and more impacts, faster and sooner than we had anticipated."" The problems have gotten so bad that the panel had to add a new and dangerous level of risks. In 2007, the biggest risk level in one key summary graphic was ""high"" and colored blazing red. The latest report adds a new level, ""very high,"" and colors it deep purple. You might as well call it a ""horrible"" risk level, said van Aalst: ""The horrible is something quite likely, and we won't be able to do anything about it."" The report predicts that the highest level of risk would first hit plants and animals, both on land and the acidifying oceans. Climate change will worsen problems that society already has, such as poverty, sickness, violence and refugees, according to the report. And on the other end, it will act as a brake slowing down the benefits of a modernizing society, such as regular economic growth and more efficient crop production, it says. ""In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans,"" the report says. And if society doesn't change, the future looks even worse, it says: ""Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts."" While the problems from global warming will hit everyone in some way, the magnitude of the harm won't be equal, coming down harder on people who can least afford it, the report says. It will increase the gaps between the rich and poor, healthy and sick, young and old, and men and women, van Aalst said. But the report's authors say this is not a modern day version of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Much of what they warn of are more nuanced troubles that grow by degrees and worsen other societal ills. The report also concedes that there are uncertainties in understanding and predicting future climate risks. The report, the fifth on warming's impacts, includes risks to the ecosystems of the Earth, including a thawing Arctic, but it is far more oriented to what it means to people than past versions. The report also notes that one major area of risk is that with increased warming, incredibly dramatic but ultra-rare single major climate events, sometimes called tipping points, become more possible with huge consequences for the globe. These are events like the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which would take more than 1,000 years. ""I can't think of a better word for what it means to society than the word `risk,""' said Virginia Burkett of the U.S. Geological Survey, one of the study's main authors. She calls global warming ""maybe one of the greatest known risks we face."" Global warming is triggered by heat-trapping gases, such as carbon dioxide, that stay in the atmosphere for a century. Much of the gases still in the air and trapping heat came from the United States and other industrial nations. China is now by far the No. 1 carbon dioxide polluter, followed by the United States and India. Unlike in past reports, where the scientists tried to limit examples of extremes to disasters that computer simulations can attribute partly to man-made warming, this version broadens what it looks at because it includes the larger issues of risk and vulnerability, van Aalst said. Freaky storms like 2013's Typhoon Haiyan, 2012's Superstorm Sandy and 2008's ultra-deadly Cyclone Nargis may not have been caused by warming, but their fatal storm surges were augmented by climate change's ever rising seas, he said. And in the cases of the big storms like Haiyan, Sandy and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the poor were the most vulnerable, Oppenheimer and van Aalst said. The report talks about climate change helping create new pockets of poverty and ""hotspots of hunger"" even in richer countries, increasing inequality between rich and poor. Report co-author Maggie Opondo of the University of Nairobi said that especially in places like Africa, climate change and extreme events mean ""people are going to become more vulnerable to sinking deeper into poverty."" And other study authors talked about the fairness issue with climate change. ""Rich people benefit from using all these fossil fuels,"" University of Sussex economist Richard Tol said. ""Poorer people lose out."" Huq said he had hope because richer nations and people are being hit more, and ""when it hits the rich, then it's a problem"" and people start acting on it. Part of the report talks about what can be done: reducing carbon pollution and adapting to and preparing for changing climates with smarter development. The report echoes an earlier U.N. climate science panel that said if greenhouse gases continue to rise, the world is looking at another about 6 or 7 degrees Fahrenheit (3.5 or 4 degrees Celsius) of warming by 2100 instead of the international goal of not allowing temperatures to rise more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius). The difference between those two outcomes, Princeton's Oppenheimer said, ""is the difference between driving on an icy road at 30 mph versus 90 mph. It's risky at 30, but deadly at 90."" Tol, who is in the minority of experts here, had his name removed from the summary because he found it ""too alarmist,"" harping too much on risk. But the panel vice chairman, Jean-Pascal  van Ypersele, said that's not quite right: ""We are pointing for reasons for alarm ... It's because the facts and the science and the data show that there are reasons to be alarmed. It's not because we're alarmist."" The report is based on more than 12,000 peer reviewed scientific studies. Michel Jarraud, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, a co-sponsor of the climate panel, said this report was ""the most solid evidence you can get in any scientific discipline."" Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University who wasn't part of this report, said he found the report ""very conservative"" because it is based on only peer reviewed studies and has to be approved unanimously. There is still time to adapt to some of the coming changes and reduce heat-trapping emissions, so it's not all bad, said study co-author Patricia Romero-Lankao of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. ""We have a closing window of opportunity,"" she said. ""We do have choices. We need to act now.""",31/03/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/science/new-un-report-warns-humans-more-vulnerable-than-ever-to-effects-of-climate-change
"Time for real leadership on climate change, energy, national security","The parallels between the political decisions regarding climate change we have made and the decisions that led Europe to World War One are striking  and sobering.  The decisions made in 1914 reflected political policies pursued for short-term gains and benefits, coupled with institutional hubris, and a failure to imagine and understand the risks or to learn from recent history.  The result was a disaster in many ways; its reverberations continue to shape Europe and indeed the entire world today. 2014 marks the centennial anniversary of the commencement of World War One, 15 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 10 years since the 9/11 Commissions sobering report on the last great external threat that impacted all Americans. [pullquote] Today, the Russians are on the move in the Crimea, the U.S. Department of Defense just released their capstone strategic document, and all the while we witness another unprecedented hot summer in Australia, a new Ocean opening in the Arctic and the wettest January on record for England and Wales.  Any connection? The connection is what choices we make and how we make them when confronting complex world security situations where the future seems obvious only in retrospect and the dynamic present can feel overwhelming, what former secretary of state George P. Shultz refers to as a world awash in change. Once again nations face a challenge  climate change -- which, if left unmanaged, has the potential to bring tremendous pain to tens of millions of people, and disrupt seriously the existing economic, political, and security orders of the day. While we do not know exactly how climate change will evolve, we do know that ignoring climate change is the same as assuming that there will be no change.  And that is exceeding unlikely.  And like the leaders on whose watch World War One started, todays climate change policies of denial and delay are supremely dangerous. So what to do? We need to have adequate warning of truly extreme conditions or abrupt, unexpected changes in the worlds climate. Public and private-sector decision-makers require more understandable, more relevant, and more actionable information so they can better balance the risks, needs, and costs of adaptation with their many other competing political and economic concerns and responsibilities. This goal cannot be achieved without significantly improving our ability to monitor the earths systems so we can better understand when, why, and how the details of our climate are changing. Its all about the water.  We must sharpen our focus on, and devote greater resources to, the management and efficient use of freshwater, both within national borders and in a cross-border context. Changes and variations in rainfall frequency, intensity and distribution, with some places drying out and other regions getting wetter, will affect virtually every aspect of our lives. Closely related to the changes in water supply will be changes and challenges in how we grow our future food.  And we must begin to seriously address another water challenge -- the inexorable rise in sea level, which threatens our coastal communities, vital economic and security infrastructure, and the lives of tens of millions of Americans and billions of people worldwide. Finally, we must attack and solve the root cause of the challenge:  unchecked carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses entering the atmosphere. We must incentivize and transform research and development into reliable and economically viable low to no carbon baseline power generation and transportation fuels; a revenue-neutral carbon tax is a great place to start. We must think about how we make these new and existing technologies available to, and affordable for, the entire world. We must size the opportunity to focus our best minds on this challenge, then develop the needed technologies and drive their costs down so that we can be the world leader in supplying these capabilities to the world.  Ubiquitous non-carbon based power and clean water can change the world in a huge way  for the better  and the U.S. can lead the way. So here we are in 2014, facing uncertainties and choices of enormous consequence, just as the European powers faced their choices in 1914. The data and projections are laid out in front of us, as they were for them.  Will future historians, looking back at the choices we make now, come to a similar conclusion as the 9/11 Commission:  the most important failure was one of imagination? Perhaps not  We see signs of hope and progress. The U.S. Department of Defense in its recently released Quadrennial Defense Review treats climate change in a strategically coherent manner  linking its impacts with other global trends such as population change, growing affluence and globalization. The three proposals listed above are all feasible and affordable.  Our nation, when focused, can perform amazing, nearly miraculous feats.  But it requires leadership.  We sincerely hope our political leadership remembers those ghosts from history nearly a century ago -- and this time averts the crisis.",31/03/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/time-for-real-leadership-on-climate-change-energy-national-security
"Nate Silver, trashed over climate change, apologizes for his website","Also ...  Maher pulls a fast one  Nate Silver, trashed over climate change, apologizes for his website  The list of Nate Silver critics just keeps on growing. Harry Reid, Paul Krugman, climate-change advocates and on and on. Whether or not you care about this data guru who aims to revolutionize journalism, its a fascinating look at how someone riding high in the media world can suddenly be brought low. The Senate majority leader has jumped on the bandwagon of Democrats slamming Silver, who was beloved by the left when he predicted President Obamas reelection while working for the New York Times. He gave me a 16 percent chance of being reelected, he gave Heidi Heitkamp an 8 percent chance of being reelected, he gave Jon Tester a [34] percent chance of being reelected, Reid said. So all polls are about like Nate Silvers predictions: good sometimes, bad most of the time. Silver, as I noted last week, has angered the Democratic Party by giving the Republicans a 60 percent chance of capturing the Senate this fall. But now that hes taken his 538 blog to ESPN, his problems run deeper than just disgruntled partisans. A 538 piece by Colorado professor Roger Pielke that downplayed the impact of climate change has many in the global-warming crowd up in arms. The piece argued that while the cost of climate-related disasters is increasing, thats because of the growing wealth of the world population, not the burgeoning impact of climate change. Silver has been forced to backtrack, saying: Reception to the article ran about 80 percent negative in the comments section and on social media. A reaction like that compels us to think carefully about the piece and our editorial process. Rogers article also contained an implicit policy recommendation in its closing paragraph. Whether or not the recommendation was justified by Rogers thesis and evidence, we generally prefer to avoid these kind of recommendations, and instead allow readers to draw any policy conclusions for themselves. Furthermore, there was some loose language in the article. We pride ourselves on precise, matter-of-fact language. These things reflect a poor job of editing on our part. Silver says he is commissioning a rebuttal piece, but that the turnaround will not be instantaneousa problem in the lightning-quick web world. Please realize that you are using untruths to attack the reputation of someone who you know nothing about, he said by e-mail. If you actually did some real reporting you might be surprised at what you find. ""Roger is a freelance contributor and his private communications do not represent FiveThirtyEight,"" Silver said in a statement to HuffPost. ""We had candid conversations with Michael Mann and Kevin Trenberth. We made clear that Roger's conversations with them did not reflect FiveThirtyEight's editorial values."" To make matters worse, Silvers guy got into a dustup with two climate scientists, Michael Mann and Kevin Trenberth. Mann told the liberal group Think Progress that Pielkes article was deeply misleading, confirming some of my worst fears that Nate Silvers new venture may become yet another outlet for misinformation when it comes to the issue of human-caused climate change. That prompted Pielke to send a toughly letter to the two scientists that they regarded as threatening. In a statement to the Huffington Post, Silver said: ""Roger is a freelance contributor and his private communications do not represent FiveThirtyEight. We had candid conversations with Michael Mann and Kevin Trenberth. We made clear that Roger's conversations with them did not reflect FiveThirtyEight's editorial values."" Not exactly an auspicious debut for a new website. The larger problem for Silver is that, so far at least, his site isnt terribly compelling. The posts are okay, ranging from mildly interesting to decidedly dull. Theres little spark and almost nothing in there that compels me to check it regularly. Silver has been trash-talking the media, calling most major op-ed columnists purveyors of crap, clearly suggesting that he can do far better. Silver seemed to realize he had jacked up expectations too high during a Daily Show appearance last week: Well, here's the thing: Maybe on programs like this, there was a lot of hype about me and about FiveThirtyEight-- I called you the Lord of the Algorithm! Stewart said. Yeah, and that was useful for book sales at the time, but right now it kind of sets a very high bar. A bar that, so far at least, Nate Silver isnt clearing. Maher pulls a fast one When liberal HBO host Bill Maher brought up Paul Ryan's recent remarks on inner-city causes of poverty, you might have thought he was going to join in the misguided attack that the former VP candidate was being racist. Especially when Maher read this quote: ""When it comes to getting an education, too many of our young people cant be bothered. Theyre sitting on couches playing video games, watching TV. Instead of dreaming of being a teacher or a lawyer or a business leader, theyre fantasizing about being a baller or a rapper."" Except that Maher was fooling his guests. The quote was actually from the first lady: ""It does sound like Michelle Obama is agreeing with Paul Ryan."" So why, he asked, should a white person get beat up for saying something similar?

Deepening divide over climate change sparks fierce debate,"In the climate change debate, believers and skeptics alike have vastly different opinions based on widely divergent facts. That was illustrated by Wednesday's release of ""Climate Change Reconsidered II,"" a study by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, which draws its conclusions from thousands of peer-reviewed papers, and which finds global warming to be an entirely manageable, if not beneficial, change in the climate. The report stands in stark contrast  to the U.N.'s  latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report  of March 31, which predicts ""severe impacts""  from climate change, but which was toned down from earlier IPCC reports that predicted an array of global catastrophes resulting from the proliferation of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. The IPCC reports have, through the years, stood as the unassailable foundation for the Obama administration regulatory policy on global warming. ""The debate is settled. Climate change is a fact,"" Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union Address. ""The dirty little secret  is , we are now at 17 years and 8 months of no global warming,"" says Roger Pilon, Vice President  for Legal Affairs at the Cato Institute. ""Their models have failed year in and year out, "" he says of the scientists who comprise the 97 percent consensus the administration frequently cites. The NIPCC report  finds: -- That warming from greenhouse gases will be so small as to be indiscernible from natural variability. -- The impact of modestly rising CO2 levels on plants, animals and humans has been mostly positive. -- The costs of trying to limit emissions vastly exceed the benefits. The NIPCC report was immediately assailed by administration supporters. The website Media Matters reported that the NIPCC study was published by the conservative Heartland Institute, which previously denied the science demonstrating the dangers of tobacco and secondhand smoke. (In fact, Heartland's denial  of the  dangers of second hand smoke was re-affirmed by a large scale 2013 study  in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute which found ""no statistically significant relationship between lung cancer and exposure to passive smoke."") Yet, the administration and its supporters seem unbowed  by any contrary findings of the dangers of global warming. Just this week, in testimony  before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  Secretary of State John Kerry said of global warming, ""All of the predictions of the scientists are not just being met, they're being exceeded."" Speaking in Portland, Oregon Tuesday night, former secretary of state and potential Democratic presidential candidate,Hillary Clinton said to vigorous applause, ""Climate change is a national security problem, not just an environmental problem."" Skeptics believe those statements are demonstrably false. They point to observable data, not computer modeling, to prove their point. ""Carbon dioxide does not cause weather to become more extreme, is not causing polar ice and sea ice to melt, is not causing sea level rises to accelerate,"" Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute said at a Washington event  in which the NIPCC report was released. All of this is leading Congressional doubters to further question an array of  EPA regulations the president has unleashed to maneuver around Congressional resistance to cap and trade and other carbon-mitigating legislation. In a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing Wednesday, Senator Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska,  told EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, ""The sheer number of proposed rule makings, coupled with cost of compliance with the vast array of regulations already on the books...is very, very frustrating."" Longtime climate change skeptic Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., introduced legislation last week that would tackle the administration's regulatory end-run around Congress. It would prevent the EPA from issuing any final rule until it conducts an economic analysis as required under the Clean Air Act.",09/04/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/deepening-divide-over-climate-change-sparks-fierce-debate
"UN finding on climate change is just a bunch of hot air, new report claims","A U.N.-commissioned panel says climate change is hurting the growth of crops, affecting the quality of water supplies and forcing wildlife to change the way it lives  but what if its all just smoke and mirrors? A new report from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), written by an international collection of scientists and published by the conservative Heartland Institute, claims just that, declaring that humanity's impact on climate is not causing substantial harm to the Earth. All across the planet, the historical increase in the atmospheres CO2 concentration has stimulated vegetative productivity, reads a portion of the 1,063-page report, called Climate Change Reconsidered II: Biological Impacts. This observed stimulation, or greening of the Earth, has occurred in spite of many real and imagined assaults on Earths vegetation, including fires, disease, pest outbreaks, deforestation and climatic change. The Heartland Institute says more than 30 scientists served as authors and reviewers for the new report, which it claims cites more than 1,000 peer-reviewed studies supporting the belief that climate change is not detrimental to the biosphere. The Heartland Institute describes itself as a think tank promoting public policy ""based on individual liberty, limited government and free markets."" The panel of scientists says human impact on the global climate is small, changing temperatures are within a historic scope of temperature variables and there is no net harm to human health of the production of food. The findings are a stark contrast to the messages from the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which in a report released last week concluded that in many regions of the earth, changing precipitation and melting snow are altering hydrological systems, which negatively impact the quantity of water resources. The IPCCs report also states that climate change is forcing terrestrial, freshwater and marine species to shift their geographical ranges and migration patterns. But the Heartland Institute says the scientific community is under tremendous financial and peer pressure to reach the conclusion that global industry is damaging the environment. Ethical standards have been lowered, peer review has been corrupted, and we cant trust peers in our most prestigious journals anymore, Joe Bast, President and CEO of Heartland Institute, told Fox News. However, scientists are questioning the credibility of the NIPCCs findings. Donald Wuebbels, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Indiana Champaign Urbana, says the report is not peer-reviewed. Mostly its a bunch of old, retired guys that got together and wrote a report for the Heartland Institute that is basically full of misinformation, he told Fox News. The Heartland Institute, which is going to publicly roll out the report Wednesday in Washington, D.C., insists that it is peer-reviewed. Meanwhile, government officials and top climate scientists are meeting in Berlin this week to approve a draft U.N. study on fossil fuel emissions. The study asserts that world powers are running out of time to cut their use of high-polluting fossil fuels and stay below agreed limits on global warming, according to Reuters. The study says nations will have to make drastic pullbacks of greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over pre-industrial times. The draft study outlines ways to cut emissions and boost low-carbon energy, such as nuclear and solar power, Reuters reports.

The inconvenient truth about climate change and Obama?? policies,"The inconvenient truth President Obama denies about climate change is that Chinas refusal to cooperate in international efforts to address the problem makes U.S. efforts to slow its pace futile. Moreover, his policies severely handicap Americas ability to mitigate its consequences. The global climate has gone through profound cycles of cooling and warming since long before humans walked the Earth. While public figures and some scientists may disagree, the majority of researchers have concluded that human activities  in particular, greenhouse gas emissions  are now a significant cause of global warming, and they are urging concerted international action. Carbon dioxide composes 80 percent of harmful emissions. Having failed to win congressional approval for a system of permits to reduce emissions, the president has unilaterally targeted coal-fired electric utilities and fuel used in transportation to reduce U.S. emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels. Those actions are unnecessary and harmful. [pullquote] In recent years, more abundant and cheaper natural gas has motivated electric utilities to switch from coal, and energy intensive manufacturers in metals, chemicals and the like have made remarkable, cost-saving progress to reduce energy use. Responding to consumer preferences, automakers were making more fuel-efficient vehicles before the president imposed more stringent mileage standards. The high cost and stress of commuting are encouraging many young people to live closer to their jobs. Competition from rail is pressuring trucking companies to purchase more fuel-efficient rigs. Together, those free-market decisions have reduced CO2 emissions by more than 9 percent from 2005 levels. Now the EPA and other federal agencies want to micro-manage those choices by imposing inflexible standards on electric utilities and other manufacturers. Progressives would happily force as many Americans as they can onto mass transit, imposing a terrible drain on state transportation and local government operating budgets. Those initiatives would not do much to arrest global warming, but by increasing taxes and production costs, they would send more jobs to China. With an economy about half the size, China already emits almost twice as much CO2 as either the United States or Europe. Every 18 months, its emissions grow enough to replace the emissions savings the United States will accomplish by hitting the presidents 15-year target. Other developing countries, like India, are similarly adding to the problem; however, China accounts for about 85 percent of the annual increase in global CO2 emissions. When jobs are outsourced to China, global emissions go up, because China uses energy less efficiently and relies more heavily on coal than the United States, and the growth of manufacturing encourages migration to cities where folks use more electricity and automotive fuel. Simply, without Chinas cooperation, U.S. efforts are futile. Progressives propose to bring China and other nations along through diplomacy, but despite considerable effort, the president has not been able to obtain Beijings cooperation on climate change, its undervalued currency, or just about anything else that would constrain the Middle Kingdoms growth. Put bluntly, if man-made emissions are the culprit, then by Chinas actions alone global warming is going to happen with the force and fury many fear. The United States can do little to stop it, and efforts to do so will only reduce U.S. resources available to mitigate its consequences. U.S. economic growth has fallen from 3.4 percent during the Reagan-Clinton years to 1.7 percent since the beginning of this century. This slowdown was caused by U.S currency and trade policies toward China that disadvantage U.S. manufacturers, restrictions on offshore oil and gas development that keep America dependent on imports, and costly and ineffective regulations on banking, health care and other industries. Millions of Americans are without decent jobs, and governments at all levels are severely challenged. Those will get worse if the nation continues on its current path. Rising temperatures will confront federal and state agencies with unparalleled challenges, as droughts dislocate cattle ranchers in the Southwest, insects threaten forests, arable regions shift north, rising seas flood coastal cities and new diseases attack humans, plants and animals. Moving populations and economic activities will cost trillions of dollars, and an economy impoverished by mindless micro-management from Washington simply wont be able to generate the tax dollars to foot the bill. Americans will be forced to abandon farms and cities  simply, fend for themselves  as Washington will not be able to sustain the essential elements of civilization.",16/05/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-inconvenient-truth-about-climate-change-and-obamas-policies
UN climate change expert reveals bias in global warming report,"Three of the four installments of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which claims to show the state of the global climate system under stress, are now available. All three show things are seriously amiss  although not necessarily with the climate itself. The final installment, to be published in September will further underline the need to reform the IPCC. The IPCC has three working groups, each producing its own report. Working Group I, focusing on climate change itself, released its findings last September. Compared to the previous report, of 2007, it quietly revised downwards its estimate of eventual global warming. [pullquote] The IPCC became less pessimistic about climate change, although its press release would not tell you so. The report also illustrates just how outmoded the IPCC has become since it was founded in 1988. Its reports are written over a period of three years, and finished months before publication. When preparations started on AR5, the world hadnt warmed for 13 years. That is a bit odd, if you believe the models, but not odd enough to merit a lot of attention. By the time the report was finished, however, it hadnt warmed for 17 years. That is decidedly odd, but hard to accommodate in a near-final draft that has been through three rounds of review. After the report was finalized, but before it was published, a number of papers appeared with hypotheses about the pause in warming. AR5 was out of date before it was released. The IPCC model  every six years a big splash of climate analysis  is broken. Working Group 2, published in March, and focusing on the impacts of climate change, had a different problem. It lies at the heart of the previous IPCC controversy. The scientific literature now acknowledges that many of the more worrying impacts of climate change are in fact symptoms of social mismanagement and underdevelopment. The first rule of climate policy should be: do no harm to economic growth. But the IPCC was asked to focus on the risks of climate change alone, and those who volunteered to be its authors eagerly obliged. There is even a groundbreaking section on emerging risks. The first paper on an issue is always dramatic. That is the only way to get something onto the scientific agenda. Follow-up papers then pooh-pooh the initial drama. But the IPCC chose not to wait for those follow-up papers. IPCC reports are often two to three thousand pages long, but there are two or three main findings only. Authors who want to see their long hours of IPCC work recognized should thus present their impact as worse than the next one. It was this inbuilt alarmism that made me step down from the team that drafted the Summary for Policy Makers of Working Group 2. And indeed, the report was greeted by the four horsemen of the apocalypse: famine, pestilence, war, death all made headlines. Aprils Working Group 3 had yet another problem. Its focus, climate policy, is a hot political debate in many countries. The Summary for Policy Makers is drafted by academics, but approved line-by-line by government representatives. Every clause that could possibly be used against a government position, either in a domestic debate or in international negotiations, was neutered or removed. But the authors are at fault, too. A little bit of emission reduction costs little. But as targets get more stringent, costs escalate. Not so according to the IPCC: Very ambitious targets are said to be only slightly more expensive than less ambitious targets. This surprising finding is a statistical fluke. Emission reduction is easy according to some studies, which duly explore very ambitious targets. Emission reduction is hard according to other studies; very ambitious targets are prohibitively expensive and results not reported. The surprisingly low cost of meeting very stringent emission reduction targets is the result of selection bias. Oddly, the IPCC made the same mistake in the previous report. The final part of the AR5 report, the Synthesis, will be published in September. It will fail to offer policy makers what they need to know: a systematic comparison of the costs of climate policy to its benefits, the avoided impacts of climate change. Compared to the most famous cost-benefit analysis of them all, the Stern Review, published in 2006, the IPCC finds that the impacts of climate change are lower and the impacts of climate policy higher. But the IPCC will not suggest that the emission reduction targets recommended by Stern  global emissions 25 percent below 2005 levels by 2050; stabilize warming at 2-3 C  are, perhaps, too stringent. Given its flaws, should the IPCC be disbanded? That would be pointless. Climate change is a problem of the future. Climate policy responds to forecasts of the future rather than measurements of the past. There are large climate bureaucracies around the world, who exist by virtue of climate science. If you abolish the IPCC, the climatocracy will create a new IPCC. The IPCC should therefore be reformed. Here are some suggestions: Away with the infrequent, massive set pieces. Away with alarmism  that has been tried for 25 years, with no discernible impact on emissions. Away with activists posing as scientists. Away with the freshman mistakes. Just good, sober, solid science. Let the chips fall where they may.",20/05/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/un-climate-change-expert-reveals-bias-in-global-warming-report
Climate change: The moment I became a climate skeptic,"I got my first lesson on the subject of climate change more than 10 years ago. My tutor was an internationally famous climate scientist at a major Ivy League university. Unlike most lectures I have heard from professors, this one was brief, to the point and extremely enlightening. At the time I was a columnist for the New York Daily News, recently arrived in the United States after more than 30 years in Israel. I had heard about global warming, of course, but I hadnt thought much about it. Israel has other, more pressing issues. [pullquote] In May 2001, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its third report, which got a lot of media attention. I looked through it and realized immediately that I had no chance of understanding the science. I was in good company  I doubt there are half a dozen journalists in captivity who can actually understand the mathematical and chemical formulas and computer projections. Thats what press releases are for. One item got my attention. It said: Projections based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios suggest warming over the 21st Century at a more rapid rate than that experienced for at least the last 10,000 years. I called the professor, one of the authors of the report, for a clarification (he remains nameless because we were off the record). If global warming is caused by man-made emissions, I asked, what accounts for the world warming to this same level 10,000 years ago? There was a long silence. Then the professor said, Are you serious? I admitted that I was. The professor loudly informed me that my question was stupid. The panels conclusion was indisputable science, arrived at after years of research by a conclave of the worlds leading climate scholars. Who was I to dispute it? I told him I wasnt disputing it, just trying to understand how, you know, the world could have been this hot before without the help of human agency. Maybe this is just a natural climate change like ice ages that once connected continents and warming periods that caused them to drift apart or ... At which point I heard a click. The professor hung up on me. At that exact moment I became a climate skeptic. I may not know anything about science, but I have learned over a long career that when an expert hangs up in the middle of a question, it means that he doesnt know the answer. This isnt shocking. Experts, even on subjects less complicated than what the worlds temperature will be in 200 years, are often wrong. One tip-off is when they argue by assuring you that everybody smart already knows they are right. I was reminded of this encounter the other day while reading a Time Magazine cover story titled, Eat Butter: Scientists labeled fat the enemy. Why they were wrong. The article chronicled the decades-long consensus, backed by official U.S. government policy as well as a militant (and self-interested) scientific establishment, that fat was a killer. According to Time, this was so embedded in modern medicine and nutrition that it became nearly impossible to challenge the consensus. Scientific journals refused to publish data challenging this orthodoxy. People who did, like Dr. Robert Atkins, were derided as quacks. Now that consensus has flipped (Time Magazine doesnt publish articles outside any current consensus). It may flip again someday as we learn even more about nutrition and health. But for now, the danger of eating fat  once an unshakable tenet of settled science  is out of intellectual fashion. People who have virtuously deprived themselves of t-bones, ice cream and cheesecake are now left with egg on their faces. It is a reminder that bad science, backed by a politicized posse of experts, can have distasteful consequences. Another recent article, this one in the New York Times, also caught my eye. It reported that a submerged forest in Wales has suddenly re-emerged, revealing traces that humans had lived there before the sea rose after the last ice age. About 10,000 years ago, temperatures warmed sharply, by eight to ten degrees Fahrenheit, said Dr. Martin Bates, a geoarcheologist called in to examine the situation. The footprints found in the sediment belonged to refugees of prehistoric climate change, he said (happily, Wales has since been repopulated). Dr. Nicholas Ashton of the British Museum, a participant in the project, was philosophical. We can reconstruct the climate and climate change nearly one million years ago, he said. The big lesson is, we have to adapt. Whether we like it or not the climate will change  it always has. He quickly added that human beings were now accelerating that change. The Times reporter didnt ask him how much the change was accelerating, or what, besides people, might be causing an eons-old phenomenon. Perhaps she didnt wonder. Or maybe she didnt feel like getting hung up on by an expert.",30/06/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-the-moment-i-became-a-climate-skeptic
"Curtain, reviews come down on taxpayer-funded climate change musical","The curtain has come down on Climate Change: The Musical and reviews of the taxpayer-funded play about global warming are downright icy. The play, which is actually entitled ""The Great Immensity,"" and was produced by Brooklyn-based theater company The Civilians, Inc. with a $700,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, ended its run early amid a storm of criticism from reviewers and lawmakers alike. It opened a year late, reached just five percent of its anticipated audience and likely fell short of its ambitious goal of informing a new generation about the perceived dangers of man-caused climate change. Plus, it apparently wasn't very good. Despite fine performances, the musical mystery tour is an uneasy mix of fact and credulity-stretching fiction. Its neither flora nor fauna, New York Daily News reviewer Joe Dziemianowicz wrote in a review at the time. [The] songs  whether about a doomed passenger pigeon or storm-wrecked towns  feel shoehorned in and not, pardon the pun, organic. The play, which featured songs and video exploring Americans relationships to the environment, opened in New York in April with a three-week run before going on a national tour that was supposed to attract 75,000 patrons. But it stalled after a single production in Kansas City, falling short of the lofty goals outlined in a grant proposal. It was envisioned as a chance to create ""an experience that would be part investigative journalism and part inventive theater, help the public ""better appreciate how science studies the Earths biosphere and increase public awareness, knowledge and engagement with science-related societal issues. According to a plot description on the theater companys website, ""The Great Immensity"" focuses on a woman named Phyllis as she tries to track down a friend who disappeared while filming an assignment for a nature show on a tropical island. During her search, she also uncovers a devious plot surrounding an international climate summit in Auckland, New Zealand. The description touts the play as a thrilling and timely production with a highly theatrical look into one of the most vital questions of our time: How can we change ourselves and our society in time to solve the enormous environmental challenges that confront us? Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, said the dramatic debacle was a waste of public money. There is no doubt that the Great Immensity was a great mistake, Smith told FoxNews.com. The NSF used taxpayer dollars to underwrite political advocacy dressed up as a musical. And the project clearly failed to achieve any of its objectives. In a statement to FoxNews.com, the NSF said it is too soon to tell if the grant funds were wasted. This particular project just concluded in August and the final report has not yet been submitted to NSF, the statement said. Final reports are due to NSF within 90 days following expiration of the grant. The final report will contain information about project outcomes, impacts and other data. But Smith and others in Congress said the foundation owes an explanation to lawmakers - and taxpayers. The NSF has offered no comment, neither a defense of the project nor an acknowledgement that funding was a waste of money, Smith said. The NSF must be held accountable for how they choose to spend taxpayer dollars. Other reviews of the play were similarly dismal. ""Even the best adventurers can wander off course, and the Civilians do so on a global scale in The Great Immensity, read a review from Time Out New York. The inventive troupes latest effort is all over the map... Its not easy preaching green. The Civilians, Inc. did not return requests for comment. FoxNews.com first reported on the House Committees dismay over the grant program back in March. Smith had also questioned the validity of other grants from the NSF including; $200,000 towards a three-year study of the Bronze Age, Another $50,000 towards the survey of archived lawsuits from 17th century Peru and $20,000 for a study on the causes of stress in Bolivia. All government employees and their agency heads need to remember they are accountable to the American taxpayer who pays their salary and funds their projects, Smith said at a March hearing.",20/09/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/curtain-reviews-come-down-on-taxpayer-funded-climate-change-musical
Obama urges international cooperation on climate change,"In the first international test for his climate-change strategy, President Barack Obama pressed world leaders Tuesday to follow the United States' lead on the issue, even as a one-day United Nations summit revealed the many obstacles that still stand in the way of wider agreements to reduce heat-trapping pollution. ""The United States has made ambitious investments in clean energy and ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions,"" Obama said. ""Today I call on all countries to join us, not next year or the year after that, but right now. Because no nation can meet this global threat alone."" Obama was the headliner at a marathon session of world leaders who promised to spend billions of dollars to take better care of the planet. Tuesday's one-day meeting at the annual U.N. General Assembly involving more than 100 world leaders was a forum for non-binding pledges. It was designed to lay the groundwork for a new global treaty to tackle climate change in December 2015, but it also revealed the sharp differences that divide countries on matters such as deforestation, carbon pollution and methane leaks from oil and gas production: -- Brazil, a key player in deforestation, said it wouldn't sign a pledge to halt deforestation by 2030. -- The United States decided not to join 73 countries in supporting a price on carbon, which Congress had indicated it would reject. -- And minutes after Obama said ""nobody gets a pass,"" China's Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli insisted the world treat developing nations, including China, differently than developed nations, allowing them release more heat-trapping pollution. China has signed a carbon-pricing agreement. ""Today we must set the world on a new course,"" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said in opening remarks. ""Climate change is the defining issue of our age. It is defining our present. Our response will define our future."" In some ways, the climate summit answered that call. The European Union said its member nations would cut greenhouse gases so that by 2030 they would be 40 percent below the 1990 level. The vow also calls for using renewable energy for 27 percent of the bloc's power needs and to increase energy efficiency by 30 percent. The United States will not release new emissions targets until early next year. More than 150 countries set the first-ever deadline on Tuesday to end deforestation by 2030, but the feasibility of that goal was eroded when a key player, Brazil, said it would not join. Forests are important because they absorb the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The United States, Canada and the entire European Union signed onto a declaration to halve forest loss by 2020 and eliminate deforestation entirely by 2030. And world leaders promised in their non-binding remarks to spend a total of at least $5 billion to make the world more sustainable. That often includes turning away from the burning of coal, oil and gas and away from the destruction of the world's carbon-absorbing forests. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, stressed it could be done without harming the economy. He said over the next seven years, the European Union would provide $3 billion euros (nearly $3.9 billion) to help developing countries become more sustainable. ""The European Union is on track to meet our targets and at same time we have seen our economy grow,"" Barroso. ""We prove climate protection and a strong economy must go hand in hand."" France promised $1 billion. Korea pledged $100 million. Others, like Chile, pledged cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. When it comes to forests, if the goal is met, the U.N. says it would be the equivalent of taking every car off the road in the world. A group of companies, countries, and nonprofits also pledged to restore more than 1 million square miles of forest worldwide by 2030. Norway vowed to spend $350 million to protect forests in Peru and another $100 million in Liberia. Japan, which had relaxed earlier promised targets, vowed to issue new goals early next year and become a model for a low-carbon society. It also said it was launching a satellite to monitor and verify emissions. Canada pledged to make cars and trucks more fuel efficient. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro used the opportunity to chastise ""polluting powers"" for causing an ""evil of such planetary dimensions"" and then wanting to barter their way out of their responsibilities. Seychelles President James Michel called small island nations like his ""victims of this pollution"" and said it was up to the countries that burn the most coal, oil and gas to do the most. ""If they don't do something, the Earth will not survive and that will be the end of us all,"" Michel said in an interview before the start of the summit. Ban, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Rajendra K. Pachauri, who headed the Nobel Prize-winning panel of scientists that studied the issue, warned that time was short. By 2020, Ban said, the world must reduce greenhouse gases to prevent an escalating level of warming that world leaders five years ago called dangerous. Leaders in 2009 pledged to keep world temperatures from increasing by another 2 degrees Fahrenheit (3.6 degrees Celsius). Pachauri and Ban told world leaders the effects of global warming are already here, pointing to a U.N. building that flooded during the devastating Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Pachauri said it will get worse with droughts, storms, food and water shortages. He foresaw even more violent climate-driven conflicts. And, Pachauri said, ""a steady rise in our death toll, especially among the world's poorest. How on Earth can we leave our children with a world like this?""",23/09/2014,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-urges-international-cooperation-on-climate-change
UN calls for ??ll hands on deck??to tackle climate change,"U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged world leaders to throw their weight fully behind the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on Tuesday, describing climate change as the defining issue of our time. To ride this storm we need all hands on deck, he said, during the opening address of the U.N. Climate Summit in New York. We have never faced such a challenge. More than 120 heads of state and government are attending the U.N. Climate Summit, which is seen as a key milestone on the path to a climate agreement in 2015. I am asking you to lead, we must cut emissions, said Ban. By the end of this century, we must be carbon neutral  we cannot emit more carbon than our planet can absorb. The U.N. chief also reiterated the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees C. above pre-industrial levels  a key target of the climate change movement. Economists have shown that this comes at minimal extra cost, while the benefits to our planet are monumental, he said. The Climate Summit comes just two days after nearly 400,000 people took to the streets of Manhattan in the largest climate march in history. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also addressed the Climate Summit on Tuesday morning, describing climate change as an existential threat to humanity. This is an issue we all face  no-one is spared, he said. For New York this is particularly urgent  two years ago Hurricane Sandy left 44 people dead in our city. Keen to put New York at the forefront of the climate change agenda, de Blasio explained that the citys greenhouse gas emissions are down 19 percent from 2005, thanks to a plan instituted by his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg. New York, he added, is fully committed to an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. On Monday Secretary of State John Kerry and Apple CEO Tim Cook delivered a rallying cry for cutting carbon emissions. However, skeptics have questioned the effort to cut carbon emissions and reshape the world economy, citing, in particular, its impact on growth. Any time world leaders are gathering, their number one focus needs to be what will promote human progress, Alex Epstein, founder of the Center for Industrial Progress, told FoxNews.com. The whole focus of this so-called climate summit is to only look at the alleged negatives of using fossils fuels  its like an antibiotics summit where you only look at the negative effects of antibiotics. Epstein, author of the forthcoming book The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, also highlighted the inherent volatility of the global climate. Nature doesnt give us a safe climate that we make dangerous,"" he said. ""It gives us a dangerous climate that we make safe, above all, by using energy from fossil fuels.' Citing data from the EM-DAT International Disaster Database, Epstein explained that climate-related deaths have actually declined 98 percent over the last 80 years. My conclusion is that, if we look at the big picture, not only are the economic benefits [of fossil fuels] overwhelmingly positive, but the environmental benefits are overwhelmingly positive, he said. The U.N. has suffered a number of blows in its push for a climate agreement. Australias new government, for example, recently repealed its two-year old national carbon tax, and countries such as Canada, Russia, and Japan have refused to sign on for an extension to the Kyoto Protocol to combat greenhouse gases. On Monday a study reported that rising temperatures in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of North America over the past century followed natural changes in the wind, as opposed to increases in greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate change? China rebuts Obama,"EXCLUSIVE: While President Obama challenged China at the United Nations to follow the U.S. lead in pushing for drastic reductions in national carbon emissions to save the planet from climate change, it appears that China has dramatically different ideas. As in: no. According to a document deposited at the Geneva-based U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in advance of a planned meeting next month, China -- now the worlds largest source of greenhouse gases -- insists that the U.S. and other developed countries endure most of the economic pain of carbon emission cutbacks, and need to make significantly more sacrifices in the months ahead. Carbon emission cutbacks by China and other developing countries, the document says, will be dependent on the adequate finance and technology support provided by developed country parties to any new climate accord. In other words, only if Western nations pay for it. More specifically, only if Western taxpayers ante up.  Among other things, the Chinese communist regime insists that the incentive payments it demands must come from new, additional, adequate, predictable and sustained public funds"" -- rather than mostly private financing, as the U.S. hopes. In addition, the Chinese state: -- A promised $100 billion in annual climate financing that Western nations have already pledged  to developing countries for carbon emission control and other actions by 2020 is only  the ""starting point"" for additional Western financial commitments that must be laid out in a ""clear road map,"" which includes ""specific targets, timelines and identified sources;"" --In the longer run, developed countries should be committing at least 1 percent of their Gross Domestic Product  much more than they spend on easing global poverty into a U.N.-administered Green Carbon Fund to pay for the developing country changes; --In the meantime, the $100 billion pledge to the same fund should be reached by $10 billion increments, starting from a $40 billion floor this year; --Western countries also need to remove obstacles such as IPRs [intellectual property rights] to promote, facilitate and finance the transfer of technologies and know-how to developing countries in advance of any future climate deal; CLICK HERE FOR THE PAPER The Chinese submission is part of the paperwork submitted by a variety of nations in advance of negotiations on a new global climate treaty, which is slated to be unveiled at a grand climate summit meeting in Paris at the end of 2015. This weeks ballyhooed climate summit in New York City was intended to kick-start the diplomatic process that will wend toward the Paris finale. The Paris 2015 treaty is supposed to replace the tattered Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2020, and which the U.S. never ratified  in large measure because huge greenhouse emitters like China and India were given a pass from most of its strictures. Since then, countries like Canada and Russia have left the protocol, and others, like Japan, have declined to tighten the screws further on carbon emissions in a time of faltering economic growth. But while President Obama was telling the summit attendees in New York that nobody can stand on the sidelines on this issue, and advising world leaders that he had told Chinas top delegate at their meeting that we have a special responsibility to lead, China has staked out its much tougher position  in a nine-page position paper drearily titled, Submission on the Work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. The working group, part of the UNFCCC process, is pulling together international positions to develop a consensus starting point for the Paris treaty negotiations, which will supposedly be unveiled at a meeting in Lima, Peru, in December. The Chinese paper, however, went to an earlier preparatory meeting slated to begin in Bonn on October 25. According to the Chinese, all of the additional Western action is necessary because developing countries have already done their part at greenhouse gas cutbacksor, as the position paper has it, in typical U.N. climate-speak, have already communicated and implemented ambitious nationally appropriate mitigation actions. Indeed, the paper continues, Their contribution to global mitigation efforts is far greater than that by developed countries. That conclusion appears to largely draw on the fact that China believes that Western countries are responsible for the current and future concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere because of their historical, current and future emissions, while developing countries have the right to equitable development opportunities and sustainable development. That was largely the logic behind the faltering Kyoto Protocol, in which China pledged only to reduce the carbon intensitythe relative greenhouse gas efficiency-- of its industrialization, without any effort at actual cutbacks. Optimists now believe that China will move in the new round of climate negotiations toward an actual trajectory of cutbacks, but there is no sign of that ambition in the current position paper. In fact, the paper argues that any new agreement should be based and built on the structures of the old Kyoto deal, with developed country Parties taking the lead in greenhouse gas emission reduction. There is perhaps one major exception: Commitments by developed country Parties [to the new treaty] on providing finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing country Parties shall be of the same legal bindingness as their mitigation commitments. In other words:  pay-as-you-go on climate change  means that so far as China is concerned, the U.S. and other advanced countries should do all the paying, and most of the going.

Weather Channel founder blasts climate change,"This is a rush transcript from ""The Kelly File,"" October 27, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MEGYN KELLY, HOST: The administration hammering the message that manmade climate change is one of mankind's greatest threats. But our next guest disagrees. John Coleman is the co- founder of the Weather Channel, winner of the American Meteorological -- that's a tough one -- Meteorological Society's award for broadcast meteorologist of the year and he has spent more than 60 years reporting on the weather. John, good to see you tonight. And so upset were you about the claims of manmade global warming that you wrote a letter to the UCLA's Hammer Museum form their forum that was called Tackling Climate Change. And you said, ""You don't have both sides represented, and I'm here to tell you that manmade global climate change is a myth."" How can you say that? JOHN COLEMAN, WEATHER CHANNEL CO-FOUNDER: Well, it's very easy. But thank you for having me on your program. You know, a climate skeptic can rarely get on TV, ever since Al Gore made it a plank of the Democratic Party. KELLY: And they say you're a ""Looney Tunes"" if you don't believe it. COLEMAN: You bet, and I been in the TV news organizations now for 60 years, and I only met two Republicans the whole time, and they were both hiding in the closet. (LAUGHTER) This is a tough go for people who don't believe in climate change. A lot study on this. KELLY: Well, we heard a lot of that from the last even presidential debate. I mean, even some of the Republican candidates up there, suggested you are nuts. Remember Jon Huntsman? If you don't believe in manmade global climate change. COLEMAN: Well, it's very difficult for anybody to be against it because the media has told the nation over and over again, day after day for 20 years that the oceans are rising, the polar bears are dying, the sea -- the ice is melting, the storms are going to sweep the earth and that we're all gonna die of a heat wave. I mean, this is an incredible bad, bad science. KELLY: What's your data to the contrary? COLEMAN: A professor at UCLA in James Engstrom was very upset that the Hammer Museum forum was going to not give both sides of the climate debate. So he suggested they should have Willie Soon from Harvard and me, join that debate, of course we were turned down. I wrote a nice memo to the people at the Hammer Museum and that got picked up by my friends at the Heartland Institute, the think tank in Chicago. They put out a press release and voila, it's been all over the media -- not the mainstream media of course, the Internet and the -- KELLY: But what's your data to the contrary? And soon the Weather Channel will be canceled all together -- they will push it out of existence since you've taken this position. But let's get specific. You talk about how the efforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and that it's causing significant warming have failed. And yet the data say that carbon dioxide was proven to be a greenhouse gas in the 1957 paper by Roger Ravel. The EPA says it's a greenhouse gas, the scientific community has accepted that it is a greenhouse gas and at the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has gone up since 1958. COLEMAN: Well, there are 9,000 PhDs and 31 scientists who have signed the petition that says it's not a significant greenhouse gas. Oh, it's a teen itsy bitsy but in greenhouse gas but it's not in any ways significant. And we are sure of it. It's not like, something I made up or just thought of. I've studied and studied and studied. And Roger Revelle, the great scientist who wrote that paper back in 1957 with Hans Suess changed his mind a decade later and said, ""Wait a minute, I think we were wrong. Don't anybody panic. I don't think there's any global warming."" And that's when Al Gore said he was senile -- (CROSSTALK) KELLY: Al Gore. OK. Al Gore said he was senile. Speaking of Al Gore, let's remind the audience on what Al Gore said. COLEMAN: Al Gore had one class in science. Roger Revelle taught it to him. He got a D and yet he's made a billion dollars off to climate change. Shame on you Al Gore. KELLY: Standby. I want to play Al Gore. This is his argument and then you can respond. Listen to him. (BEGIN VIDOE CLIP, ""AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH"") AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: Starting in 1970 there was a precipitous drop-off in the amount and extent and thickness of the arctic icecap. It has diminished by 40 percent in 40 years. And there are now two major studies showing that within the next 50 to 70 years in summertime it will be completely gone. (END OF VIDEO CLIP) KELLY: Your thoughts on that. COLEMAN: Well, I would like to announce tonight, to people who are friends of Al Gore's that, ""Whoops, he got that one wrong!"" The Antarctic icecap is at all-time record high in both coverage and thickness. And the Arctic icecap at the North Pole is at the highest it has been in several years. It's in its so-called normal range since we got satellite observations that could measure it. So, not only is the ice not melting, more polar bears are alive and happy today than we've had in 100 years. Life is good, Ms. Kelly, I got to tell you, life is good. KELLY: John Coleman, good to see you, thanks for being here, sir. I Hope the Weather Channel survives now. It's likely to lose its license. We appreciate you being here.

"Climate change: Mr. Obama, 97 percent of experts is a bogus number","Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: Climate change is real, man-made and dangerous. President Obama tweeted that, and it has been repeated by countless others. It is tempting for a politician to claim that 97 percent of experts agree with you. But do they? The 97 percent claim was taken from a study paper by Australian John Cook, Climate Communications Fellow for the Global change Institute at the University of Queensland, and his colleagues, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters in May, 2013. The paper says nothing about the would-be dangers of climate change and it counts the number of publications, rather than the number of scientists, in support of human-made climate change. Never let facts get in the way of a good story. The paper is a treasure trove of how-not-to lessons for a graduate class on survey design and analysis: the sample was not representative, statistical tests were ignored, and the results were misinterpreted. What was an incompetent piece of research has become a highly influential study, its many errors covered up. Some of the mistakes in the study should be obvious to all. There are hundreds of papers on the causes of climate change, and thousands of papers on the impacts of climate change and climate policy. Cook focused on the latter. A paper on the impact of a carbon tax on emissions was taken as evidence that the world is warming. A paper on the impact of climate change on the Red Panda was taken as evidence that humans caused this warming. And even a paper on the television coverage of climate change was seen by Cook as proof that carbon dioxide is to blame. Cook and Co. analysed somewhere between 11,944 and 12,876 papers  they cant get their story straight on the sample size  but only 64 of these explicitly state that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming. A reexamination of their data brought that number down to 41. That is half a per cent or less of the total, rather than 97 percent. The remainder of Cooks evidence is papers that said that humans caused some climate change and, more importantly, papers that Cooks colleagues thought said as much. There is vigorous debate about how much humans have contributed to climate change, but no one argues the effect is zero. By emitting greenhouse gases, changing the landscape, rerouting rivers, and huddling together in cities, we change the climate  perhaps by a little, perhaps by a lot  but not one expert doubts we do. However, a true consensus  100 per cent agreement  does not serve to demonize those experts who raise credible concerns with the state of climate research. The trouble does not end there. Cook has been reluctant to share his data for others to scrutinize. He has claimed that some data are protected by confidentiality agreements, even when they are not. He was claimed that some data were not collected, even when they were. The paper claims that each abstract was read by two independent readers, but they freely compared notes. Cook and Co. collected data, inspected the results, collected more data, inspected the results again, changed their data classification, collected yet more data, inspected the results once more, and changed their data classification again, before they found their magic 97 percent. People who express concern about the method have been smeared. We would hope that the president of the United States of America does not spend time checking such trivia. That is the job of the editor of the journal, Dan Kammen of the University of California at Berkeley, who unfortunately has chosen to ignore all issues I and others raised about them. Similarly, the journals publisher, the Institute of Physics, and Cooks employer, the University of Queensland, have turned a deaf ear to my concerns. What was an incompetent piece of research has become a highly influential study, its many errors covered up. And for what? If Cooks results are to be believed, 97 percent of experts agree that climate change is real and largely human-made. This does not tell us anything about the risks of climate change, let alone how these compare to the risks of climate policy. That is a difficult trade-off, and it should be informed by the best possible science rather than dodgy work like Cooks.",28/05/2015,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-mr-obama-97-percent-of-experts-is-a-bogus-number
Climate change brings needed rain to Africa,"Climate change has been going on since the beginning of time, but has been the source of intense debate in recent years. In the case of the Sahel area of Africa, climate change means 4 more inches of desperately-needed rainfall per year than in the past, according to a new study by climatologists in the Journal Nature Climate Change. The main cause of the increase is rising greenhouse gas emissions, it finds. The Sahel is an area about four times the size of Texas that stretches across Africa along the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. Past droughts in the area that killed thousands prompted the Live Aid concert in 1985 to fund relief efforts. Some climate experts say this and other positive effects of CO2 emissions are too often ignored. [Benefits are] certainly underreported. Scientists have known for 15 years that the Sahel was greening up and desertification was reversing there, Pat Michaels, former president of the American Association of State Climatologists, and a director at the CATO Institute, told FoxNews.com. He also noted that the Sahel area may be getting more tree and plant coverage due in part to the fact that plants have an easier time growing with more CO2 in the atmosphere. But the studys authors say that although there are some benefits, people should still worry about climate change and cut emissions. The effects of climate change are already evident around the world, and its imperative that we reduce carbon emissions to avoid the risks of much worse impacts in future, Rowan Sutton, study co-author and director of Climate Research at the UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science, told FoxNews.com. There have been temperature rises leading to increases in heat waves around the world, and related rises in evaporation from the soil that increases the risk of drought even where rainfall amounts haven't changed, he said. Global temperature has risen about 1.7 degrees over the last century but there has been virtually no warming for the last 17 years, according to NASAs data. Experts disagree about how bad warming will be. Climate models have historically overestimated global warming, but the U.N. predicts that the globe will warm between 2.5 to 5.5 degrees over the next century and that warming in that range would cause the worlds GDP to be about 1.1% lower in the year 2100. Climate experts who are relatively less worried about warming said this new paper is a welcome change of tone because it was willing to point out a benefit of warming, but they are still skeptical of the study. The skill of climate models in predicting regional rain is so poor that I do not put much stock in claims of trends towards either more or less rain, Richard Tol, a leading expert on the economics of climate change at the University of Sussex in the U.K., told FoxNews.com. The study calls for follow-up work to be done, noting that, it will be important to repeat our study with other climate models, including at higher resolution. Study co-author Buwen Dong also argues that the costs of warming outweigh the benefits even though his study found additional rainfall in drought-stricken Africa. The increases in rainfall will have been beneficial to some people in the short term, but at the same time the rise in temperatures can lead to more frequent heat waves and damage to crops, he said.

UN climate change body suffers mammoth European carbon fraud,"The United Nations body that oversees greenhouse gas reductions is reeling from another cap-and-trade scandal that may have put 600 million tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere -- roughly speaking, the annual CO2 output of Canada or Britain -- while the emissions were ostensibly suppressed, according to an independent study. In the process, the fraudsters, largely in Russia and Ukraine, were likely able to transfer credits for more than 400 million tons of their apparently bogus greenhouse savings by April 2015 into Europes commercial carbon trading system -- the largest in the world --thereby undermining that continents ambitious carbon reduction achievements. Perhaps significantly, the vast bulk of the assumed fraud took place in countries that are -- or were, in the case of Ukraine -- notorious for their kleptocratic leadership under the regimes of Vladimir Putin and ousted Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled his country in 2014. In Russia, much of the contract work for carbon project approval was carried out by state-owned Sberbank, which has been sanctioned by the U.S. and the European Union as part of the Western response to the Ukraine crisis. The bulk of the fraud occurred under the battered Kyoto Protocol for greenhouse gas emissions, but researchers who detailed the scandal warned that without tough international policing and clear definitions of what every country involved in the climate deal aims to achieve, something similar could happen in the global climate change deal that world leaders are expected to endorse in Paris in December and that is intended to start up in 2020. It remains to be seen whether those safeguards will be in place. Among other things, the emerging deal is based on what the U.N. calls intended nationally determined contributions,  or INDCs, that leave individual countries wide latitude for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, removals, as well as how the countries themselves consider their INDCs to be fair and ambitious. The vast bulk of the assumed fraud took place in countries that are notorious for their kleptocratic leadership. The Obama administration has vocally proclaimed its support for the impending new climate agreement, and has announced its intention to impose dramatic cuts in U.S. carbon emissions of  26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, and make best efforts to make the steeper cuts. CLICK HERE FOR THE U.S. COMMITMENT The most recent scandal -- there have been others -- involves the United Nations Convention for Combating Climate Change (UNFCCC), the body that oversees the Kyoto Protocol, as detailed in a 128-page analysis  issued by the Stockholm Environment Institute, a widely-respected, Swedish-financed independent think tank whose authors staunchly support the need for a new climate deal. The authors claim that their study represents a subjective judgment of the evidence based on the limited information publicly available, but also say that it is based on a careful analysis applied in a consistent manner across projects. CLICK HERE FOR THE STUDY Among other things, the document says that: One huge favorite: projects that claimed to extract coal from mining waste piles, said to prevent additional mining and save energy to boot. The researchers tallied the claims in Ukraine and estimated they came to about one-third of the entire countrys coal production, a highly implausible figure. Asked by Fox News about the report, a Bureau Veritas spokesperson said only that Bureau Veritas' management has made the decision not to comment on this research. The Stockholm researchers, who did not respond to questions from Fox News about their effort, claim that their post-mortem could have important implications for any future cap-and-trade market mechanism under a new climate treaty -- starting with the fact that countries should not be allowed to set fuzzy targets for their climate efforts that could give them carbon credit windfalls. (The authors do not say so, but one such fuzzy set of targets has been set by China, which says its aim is to achieve the peaking of carbon dioxide emissions around 2030 and make best efforts to peak early and to lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP -- as opposed to cutting emissions in absolute terms -- by 60 percent to 65 percent from the 2005 level. In 2013, Chinas CO2-GDP ratio was nearly double that of the U.S., according to a European government study.) Another reform that the Stockholm authors consider essential is that sole oversight of any such system by countries hosting carbon reduction projects is insufficient to ensure environmental integrity. But even international oversight, the report warned, may not eliminate the potential for excess issuance of [carbon] credits, and there is still the risk that countries could hamper the strengthening of a crediting mechanisms integrity. On top of all that, the report warns, U.N. deliberations on how to register carbon suppression projects under a new climate agreement still resemble current Track 1 rules insofar as countries that host the projects can still conduct the registration. The UNFCCC can request a review of the decision within 30 days, or it is automatically recorded. But draft changes to UNFCCC rule-making, the report observes, do not specify any followup if the U.N. body does not conform to international rules. Overall, the authors warn, efforts to reform carbon credit schemes under the UNFCCC have shown that often no consensus can be reached to address and rectify environmental integrity shortcomings -- an unsurprising conclusion given the fact that, among other things, the Putin regime is still ascendant in Russia. All of which, the report concludes, may mean that such crediting mechanisms will have a rather limited role when any new climate deal goes into effect -- in other words, not an end to fraud on the value of carbon reduction projects, but hopefully less paying for it. Or, perhaps, just a new incentive to fraudsters to come up with other schemes. In December 2011, a report to the European Commission described another branch of the UNFCCCs carbon-reduction schemes, known as the Clean Development Mechanism, as costly, unpredictable, unreliable, prone to gaming, and counterproductive due to perverse incentives. Soon thereafter, Europe dropped the worse of the schemes from its trading system, effective at the beginning of 2013 -- or about the time that the latest rush to cash in on Track 1 projects began.

A new low in science: Criminalizing climate change skeptics,"Scientists have many important roles to play in preparations for the upcoming UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris. Some are working hard to clarify uncertainties in the science, others on developing and evaluating alternative climate policies. One group of climate scientists is trying a different approach. Dismayed by what they see as a lack of progress on the implementation of climate policies that they support, these 20 scientists sent a letter to the White House calling for their political opponents to be investigated by the government. In particular, they are voicing their support of a proposal by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) for a RICO investigation of fossil fuel corporations and their supporters, who the scientists allege have deceived the American people about the risks of climate change, with the consequence of forestalling Americas response to reducing carbon emissions. RICO, short for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, is a federal law enacted in 1970 as a crime-fighting tool for use against the Mafia. It includes prison sentences of up to 20 years and seizure of financial assets for those found guilty of  such racketeering. What these 20 scientists have done with their letter is the worst kind of irresponsible advocacy. Attempts by powerful people to silence other scientists, especially in this brutal fashion, is a recipe for stifling scientific progress and for making poor policies. Senator Whitehouse singled out one climate scientist, Willie Soon, a solar physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who argues that changes in solar radiation, rather than carbon emissions, are the major force behind global warming. Seven other climate scientists were the targets of a recent McCarthyite witch hunt by Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.). I was one of the seven. Rep. Grijalva indicated that I was investigated because of my recent Congressional testimony summarizing peer-reviewed research indicating that the magnitude and impacts of expected warming could be less than generally believed. None of the Grijalva 7 was found to have engaged in wrongdoing of any sort, yet there have been significant career consequences for some. The demand by Senator Whitehouse and the 20 climate scientists for legal persecution of people whose research on science and policy they disagree with represents a new low in the politicization of science. The role of these 20 scientists is particularly troubling.  The consequence of this persecution, intended or not, is to make pariahs of scientists who are doing exactly what we expect of researchers: to critically evaluate evidence and publish that work in the scientific literature. Minority perspectives have an important and respected role to play in advancing science, as a mean for testing ideas and pushing the knowledge frontier forward. While President Obama bows to no one in attacking climate deniers, he recently made an important statement in a town hall meeting at the University in Iowa on the importance of challenging received knowledge in a university setting: ""Because there was this space where you could interact with people who didnt agree with you and had different backgrounds from you ... I started testing my own assumptions, and sometimes I changed my mind,"" he said. ""Sometimes I realized, maybe Ive been too narrow-minded; maybe I didnt take this into account; maybe I should see this persons perspective. Thats what college, in part, is all about."" Thats even more what real science is about. It is important for scientists to engage the public and to work with policy makers to assess the impacts and unintended consequences of policy options. However, it has become fashionable for academic scientists to advocate for certain political outcomes, without having much understanding of the policy process, economics, or the ethics of such advocacy. What these 20 scientists have done with their letter is the worst kind of irresponsible advocacy. Attempts by powerful people to silence other scientists, especially in this brutal fashion, is a recipe for stifling scientific progress and for making poor policies. Climate policy has been limited by an overly narrow set of narratives and policy options. Expanding the frameworks for thinking about climate change and climate policy can lead to developing a wider choice of options in addressing the risks from it. That is how democracy is supposed to work. We search for solutions that can garner a critical mass of support. We dont try to criminalize our political opponents, and especially should not try to criminalize scientists who have a different view.",28/09/2015,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/a-new-low-in-science-criminalizing-climate-change-skeptics
"Obama 'took the wrong side' on climate change, says physicist Freeman Dyson","Theoretical physicist and Democrat voter Freeman Dyson has expressed his disappointment with President Obamas stance on climate change. It's very sad that in this country, political opinion parted [people's views on climate change], he said, in an interview with The Register. I'm 100 percent Democrat myself, and I like Obama. But he took the wrong side on this issue, and the Republicans took the right side. Now retired, Dyson was a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton between 1953 and 1994. Famed for his work in quantum electrodynamics and nuclear engineering, Dyson also worked on climate studies during his career. Related: Scientist who urged government to sue climate skeptics gets millions from taxpayers Climate change, according to Freeman, is not a scientific mystery but a human mystery. How does it happen that a whole generation of scientific experts is blind to obvious facts?"" The physicist and mathematician argues that pollution caused by fossil fuels has been conflated with climate change. Coal is very unpleasant stuff, and there are problems with coal quite apart from climate, he said. Pollution is quite separate to the climate problem: one can be solved, and the other cannot, and the public doesn't understand that. During his interview with The Register Dyson noted shortcomings in climate models. What has happened in the past 10 years is that the discrepancies between what's observed and what's predicted have become much stronger, he said. It's clear now the models are wrong, but it wasn't so clear 10 years ago. I can't say if they'll always be wrong, but the observations are improving and so the models are becoming more verifiable. Dyson also wrote a strong foreword to a report published Monday by The Global Warming Policy Foundation, which calls for a reassessment of carbon dioxide. To any unprejudiced person reading this account, the facts should be obvious: that the non-climatic effects of carbon dioxide as a sustainer of wildlife and crop plants are enormously beneficial, that the possibly harmful climatic effects of carbon dioxide have been greatly exaggerated, and that the benefits clearly outweigh the possible damage, he wrote.",14/10/2015,https://www.foxnews.com/science/obama-took-the-wrong-side-on-climate-change-says-physicist-freeman-dyson
Paris climate change meetings: Best estimate for progress? Zero,"Highly anticipated international climate negotiations began Monday in Paris, aiming to finalize commitments from all countries to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. Countries submitted in advance their final plans (known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs), which means the potential progress from a global agreement can be estimated already. Unfortunately, though claims of success are already pouring in, the best estimate for that progress is approximately zero. Heres how we know. Any improvement must start from a baseline: what emissions and warming were expected before the INDCs? A projection created in 2000 by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), called A1B, serves this purpose well. It was designed long before the INDC process began, and  scientists worldwide use it as a baseline, as did the U.S. government in its 2014 National Climate Assessment. Under the A1B scenario, different computerized climate models produces varying estimates for how much warming would occur by 2100. The IPCC reports 3.3 degrees Celsius. Other widely-used models produce estimates of 3.4 to 3.8 degrees. Global progress on climate change depends on developing countries taking costly action to reduce future emissions, yet in Paris they are promising not to. That makes any agreement signed at the conference a bad deal for the few countries, like the U.S., that are making serious commitments. How do the INDC commitments change the picture? Climate Interactive, a partner of the U.S. State Department, calculates that warming by 2100 would be 3.5 degree Celsius. The U.N. Environment Program agrees. Thats right: forecasts using the acclaimed greenhouse gas commitments are in exactly the same range as what prior analyses, without the commitments, expected anyway. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, using a different approach, reached the same conclusion. Their in-house model found the INDCs reduced warming in 2100 by only 0.2 degrees Celsius. For reference, 2011 was about 0.12 degrees cooler than 2010; 2015 is on pace to be 0.13 degrees warmer than 2014. To understand how the worlds pledges can amount to essentially nothing, look at what developing countrieswho will account for four-fifths of emissions this centuryhave offered. China committed its emissions will peak around 2030. OK, but the federal governments Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggested four years ago that China was already on pace to do just that. China also committed to reducing its carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per dollar of GDP) by 60-to-65 per cent in 2030, as compared to 2005. But Bloomberg New Energy Finance found that less ambitious than Chinas business-as-usual course. India refused to make any emissions commitment and offered only a 33- to-35 per cent reduction in carbon intensity. This would represent a slowing of recent progressand a 2030 goal right where the countrys Centre for Policy Research expected the country to be regardless. Continuing down the list of most populous developing countries:  Brazil offered to cut emissions 37 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025, but its emissions (historically driven by deforestation, not energy use) are already down 41 percent since 2005. Pakistan, after missing every deadline, submitted a single page in mid-November making no commitments at all. Indonesias plan is too vague to assess. Nigerias submission came less than 48 hours before the start of talks, precluding even a cursory assessment. Nevertheless, a full-court press is underway to claim historic progress. Organizations like Climate Action Tracker and the above-mentioned Climate Interactive are manufacturing analysesusing worst-case warming estimates against which the commitments seem impressive, or counting on hypothetical future agreementsto create the perception of success where none has been achieved. The U.N. has joined in, projecting global emissions growth will slow in the next twenty years compared to the previous twenty. But the U.N.s IPCC already observed two years ago, before the INDCs, that most baseline scenarios project a deceleration in emissions growth, especially compared to the rapid rate observed in the past decade. Over the coming two weeks of talks, expect constant reports of ambitious commitments and important progress. Already, the New York Times is reporting that, Without the pledges, global temperatures would likely jump more than 8F [4.5C] by 2100. That is false. The 8-degree number comes from a hypothetical scenario created by the IPCC for use by climate modelers, which, it explicitly states has higher emissions than all but a few published baseline scenarios. Global progress on climate change depends on developing countries taking costly action to reduce future emissions, yet in Paris they are promising not to. That makes any agreement signed at the conference a bad deal for the few countries, like the U.S., that are making serious commitments. And its a bad deal for climate activists, who want meaningful change but will get empty platitudes instead. Only the politicians, applauding loudly for one another, stand to gain.",30/11/2015,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/paris-climate-change-meetings-best-estimate-for-progress-zero
Timeline of key events in international effort to combat climate change,"After decades of warnings from scientists that greenhouse gas emissions were warming the planet, governments started coming together in the 1980s to combat the problem. Here's a timeline of key moments in the diplomatic effort to stop global warming, leading up to the U.N. climate conference in Paris: 1987: MONTREAL  Governments adopt a treaty pledging to restrict emissions of chemicals damaging the ozone layer. While it doesn't deal with climate change specifically, the Montreal Protocol becomes a model for how to rein in man-made emissions through international agreements. 1988: NEW YORK  The U.N. General Assembly endorses the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is set up the same year by two U.N. agencies, the World Meteorological Organization and the U.N. Environmental Program, to assess the existing knowledge about climate change. 1990: LONDON  The IPCC releases its first scientific assessment of climate change. It says greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere are increasing due to human activity, resulting in warming of the Earth's surface. 1992: RIO DE JANEIRO  World leaders gathering for the first Earth Summit sign the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the first international treaty aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, it sets no binding emissions targets. 1997: KYOTO, Japan  The Kyoto Protocol is adopted, setting binding emissions targets for wealthy countries. The United States doesn't join the treaty because it doesn't include big developing countries such as China and India. The U.S. also says the treaty would harm its economy. 2004: MOSCOW  President Vladimir Putin signs a bill confirming Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The move means countries representing more than 55 percent of global emissions support the treaty, a condition for it to take effect. 2007: OSLO, Norway  Former U.S. vice president and climate campaigner Al Gore and the IPCC share the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to raise awareness about global warming. 2009: COPENHAGEN, Denmark  The first attempt to craft a global emissions treaty to replace Kyoto, which is set to expire in 2012, falls apart amid disputes between rich and poor countries over who should do what. Acrimonious negotiations end with a voluntary deal inviting countries to present nonbinding emissions targets for 2020. 2011: DURBAN, South Africa  U.N. climate talks produce a major breakthrough as countries agree to adopt a universal agreement on climate change in 2015 that would take effect five years later and apply to all of them. 2013: STOCKHOLM  The IPCC says it's ""extremely likely"" that human influence is the dominant reason for warming temperatures recorded since the mid-20th century. 2015: PARIS  More than 190 governments meet in the French capital to finish what's envisioned as a landmark deal to rein in greenhouse gas emissions after 2020.",30/11/2015,https://www.foxnews.com/world/timeline-of-key-events-in-international-effort-to-combat-climate-change
Climate change vs. free speech: Punishing fossil fuel companies for expressing doubt,"Free speech has recently been losing its battle with political correctness. Events on campuses including Yale and the University of Missouri are Exhibit A. Less noticed but equally ominous is a campaign by environmental activists and their politician allies to use criminal and civil laws to punish fossil fuel companies for expressing doubts about the inevitability of catastrophic climate change. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D R.I., was already calling for RICO charges when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman upped the ante in November with a subpoena demanding that Exxon Mobil produce decades of records about its approach to climate change. The damage Schneiderman and the rest of the Green Guards are doing to the First Amendment may well come back to haunt them. Ostensibly, Schneiderman is investigating whether Exxon Mobil was aware of but failed to adequately warn investors about the possible risks posed to the oil industry by climate change. The truth, however, is that Exxon has explicitly disclosed those risks in its financial filings and has published more than fifty scientific papers on the evidence for and against extreme climate change. ""[T]he accusation isnt really that Exxon misled the public,"" notes Holman Jenkins in the Wall Street Journal. ""Its that Exxon refused to sign up for [the left's] vision of climate doom that would justify large and immediate costs to reduce fossil fuel use."" While Schneiderman is entitled to champion a vision of climate doom, he is not entitled to use the laws against securities fraud to silence those with a different vision. For one thing, securities laws are aimed at the disclosure of facts that would otherwise be unknown to investors, not at societal threats that are part of the public debate. There is little doubt that nuclear war would have a catastrophic effect on corporate profits, but companies are not obligated to discuss those risks in their financial filings. Moreover, debate about matters of public concern, such as climate change, are at the core of the speech protected by the First Amendment. Last year, the U.S Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit warned against exactly what Schneiderman is attemptingallowing the government to ""regulate otherwise protected speech using the guise of securities laws."" Despite the ""corporations aren't people"" mantra, the Supreme Court has consistently said that the speech of corporationsfrom tobacco companies to the New York Timesis protected by the First Amendment whether it involves commercial information or political issues. Where, as in New York, the government tries to suppress speech because it disagrees with the content, the courts impose the strictest First Amendment scrutiny. Accordingly, any indictment of Exxon would likely be dismissed.  But winning in court is not the point of the New York investigation. Instead, it is akin to a SLAPP suit (a strategic lawsuit against public participation), which by definition, is aimed not at a legal victory but at silencing one's opponents in a public debate through intimidation and the burden of legal costs. Many states have enacted anti-SLAPP suit laws to protect free speech, which is under a heightened threat in Schneiderman's investigation because it is the government rather than a private party doing the intimidating. Sadly, Schneiderman, Whitehouse, and the others behind this campaign are unlikely to be deterred by the law or the facts. But perhaps they can be dissuaded with a reminder that their precedent could well come back to bite them and their sacred cows. Consider, for example, the green lobby's decades-long -- but now discredited -- warning that the world would soon run out of fossil fuels. If any company profiting from the resulting push for alternative energy had an inkling that the scarcity scenario would not pan out but failed to disclose the damage that would do to its bottom line, the company could face charges under Schneiderman's vision of securities law. And what about the groundless claim that building the Keystone Pipeline would increase carbon emissions? Perhaps a red state attorney general should launch an investigation into which green energy companies selfishly encouraged that lie without disclosing that science and logic argued against it. Conservative attorneys general need not limit their investigation of securities violations to misinformation about environmental issues. Consider the corporations advocating for immigration reform while arguing that it won't cost the jobs of American citizens. Let's hope those companies are explicitly warning their investors that business plans predicated on hiring immigrants will be endangered if evidence emerges that immigration reform hurts American workers. Finally, many companies are planning to hire increasing numbers of female science graduates based on the popular theory that, as discrimination abates, half of all science degrees will be earned by women.  What if corporate executives suspect there are real differences in the scientific ability or interests of men and women but hide their doubts from investors? Should these gender-difference deniers go to jail? If Schneiderman and his green comrades succeed, their model for silencing critics will surely be replicated by attorneys general and trial lawyers on the left and right. Progressives who don't want to go down that road should reconsider a tried-and-true approach too often eschewed by today's climate activists and student protestors. They should engage rather than silencing those with whom they disagree, trusting that if their progressive ideas are superior, those ideas will need no investigations, lawsuits or witch hunts to prevail.",01/12/2015,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-vs-free-speech-punishing-fossil-fuel-companies-for-expressing-doubt
Climate summit: Why we believe Paris proposals doom billions to live in extreme poverty,"We recently joined nearly 400 other climate scientists, physicists, mathematicians, economists, theologians, philosophers, and ethicists in signing An Open Letter on Climate Change to the People, their Local Representatives, the State Legislatures and Governors, the Congress, and the President of the United States of America. We did so for one simple reason: Proposals to fight climate change doom billions of people to live in extreme poverty, a fate much worse than global warming. The global community has made remarkable progress in its fight against poverty. The UNs Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) aimed to halve the number of people living below $1.25 per day by 2015. We thank the Lord that that target appears to have been met. How? By economic growth, primarily in China. The underlying foundations of climate predictions mean that, if one is truly interested in the well-being of poor people, the only realistic policy is to help improve their economic conditions. Even if that means allowing the climate to warm, it is unlikely that it would warm enough to pose danger, let alone a danger as great as poverty. Despite this, many people continue to live in abject poverty. One-quarter to one-third of the worlds population 1.75 billion to 2.33 billion peoplelack access to electricity, and all but three million of those live outside rich, developed countries. Worse yet, some 2.7 billion still cook their food on inefficient stoves that use dung, crop residues, and wood. It is estimated that 2 to 4 million people die prematurely each year because of health problems associated with biomass-burning stoves. Although the MDGs do not talk about economic development, economic growth is the only way for whole societies to rise out of poverty. And economic development cannot occur without abundant, affordable, reliable, non-intermittent, on-demand energy. Many climate scientists argue that we need to mitigate global warming because it will most hurt the poor. Apparently these scientists do not understand their own models. Projections from climate models are based on the rates of poverty reduction. According to these models, the highest temperature projections occur when the poorest people in the world increase their incomes from $246 (measured in constant 1990 USD) to $49,000 per year by the end of the 21st centuryor approximately the U.S. GDP per capita in 2014. On the other hand, the lowest temperature projections result when per capita income of the poorest people rises to only $3,850 annually. Although that is some 15 times more than their current incomes, it still does not ensure levels of health, long life, and other benefits people in the developed world have taken for granted for a generation or more. Overcoming poverty brings with it enormous benefits to health and every other measure one cares to choose. Rich people can cope not only with natural catastrophes but also with different climatesfrom the Arctic Circle to the Equator, from Death Valley to the Amazon rainforestbetter than poor people. Adequate wealth more than outweighs any damage from climate change. Mitigating man-made climate change, or anthropogenic global warming (AGW), requires reducing economic growth. It follows that what the advocates of AGW mitigation prescribe, is to trap the worlds poor in their poverty and all the suffering that entails. The underlying foundations of the climate predictions mean that, if one is truly interested in the well-being of poor people, the only realistic policy is to help improve their economic conditions. Even if that means allowing the climate to warm, it is unlikely that it would warm enough to pose danger, let alone a danger as great as poverty. By contrast, the foundational assumption in the IPCC climate models leads to the following conclusion: Rising CO2 emissions are, for the most part, a side effect of alleviating global poverty. To mitigate climate change we must force the vast majority of humankind to continue living in abject poverty. Preventing climate change does not help the poor, it dooms them! Poverty simply kills more people than climate. Consequently, it would be immoral to deny the poor the ability to rise from poverty by curtailing their access to abundant, affordable, reliable energy, all in pursuit of an environmental objective that only interests one billion rich people. So thats why weve endorsed the Open Letter. It conveys this message in a powerful way, a message that the American people and their leadersand people around the worldneed to hear.

House backs bill to exclude climate change from trade deals,"As negotiators in Paris worked to finalize a global agreement on climate change, the Republican-controlled House on Friday approved a bill that would block trade deals from being used to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Supporters said the wide-ranging bill would beef up enforcement of U.S. trade agreements and help prevent counterfeit goods from entering the country. The bill also would make permanent a moratorium that prevents states from taxing access to the Internet and blocks trade deals from requiring changes to U.S. immigration laws. The bill was approved on a 256-168 vote. Twenty-four Democrats joined with 232 Republicans to support the bill. The bill now goes to the Senate, where a vote is expected next week. Opponents, mostly Democrats, said the bill sends the wrong message as U.S. diplomats meet in Paris with more than 190 nations to finalize an agreement to reduce man-made carbon emissions and adapt to rising seas and increasingly extreme weather. Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., said the climate provision was inserted by Republicans who oppose action on climate change. Many Republicans in Congress question whether human activities are contributing to global warming. ""The Republican Party of the United States may be the only political party anywhere in denial about climate change,"" Levin said. ""That denial is why this provision ... on climate is before us."" Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said the bill ""will level the playing field for Americans and also make it easier for them to compete in a global marketplace."" The provisions on climate change and immigration ensure greater oversight of executive-branch negotiators who work on international trade agreements, Brady said. ""Trade agreements should not include provisions on immigration or greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said, noting that there are other ways for officials to address both immigration policy and global climate change. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the bill ensures that U.S. trade laws are enforced, that trade is streamlined and efficient and that trade agreements are not used to make significant changes to other U.S. policies, including expansion of access to visas allowing foreign nationals to enter the country. The provision on Internet taxation helps spur online innovation and ""preserve Internet freedom so it can continue to be an engine for economic growth and human development,"" McCarthy said. Democrats complained that the bill stripped important protections against currency manipulation and eliminated penalties against countries that engage in human trafficking. ""We need to get these countries to meet minimum standards on trafficking, certainly well before we enter into a trade and investment relationship with them,"" Levin said. ""Unfortunately, this (legislation) does not get us there."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bill ""turns a blind eye to human trafficking"" and criticized it for refusing to address climate change as part of trade negotiations. ""You can't separate climate and commerce,"" she said. The trade enforcement bill follows a series of votes over the summer in which the Republican-controlled Congress passed major legislation to strengthen President Barack Obama's hand in global trade talks. Obama reached a deal in October with 11 Pacific Rim countries that cuts trade barriers, sets labor and environmental standards and protects multinational corporations' intellectual property. Trade unions and liberal groups say the deal will expose American workers to foreign competition and cost jobs. Obama and most GOP leaders say the deal allows U.S. products to reach more markets. Under a law approved this year, Congress can approve or reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, but cannot change it.",11/12/2015,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-backs-bill-to-exclude-climate-change-from-trade-deals
Paris climate deal: Nothing but hot air,"If representatives of the nearly 200 nations gathered in Paris for the UN Conference on Climate Change had instead formed a coalition to fight a real threat -- Islamic terrorism -- they might have accomplished something useful. Instead, what they came up with is a document that even Secretary of State John Kerry, in a rare moment of candor, confessed is pointless. Here's Kerry: ""...The fact is that even if every American citizen biked to work, carpooled to school, used only solar panels to power their homes, if we each planted a dozen trees, if we somehow eliminated all of our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, guess what -- that still wouldn't be enough to offset the carbon pollution coming from the rest of the world."" Kerry added, ""If all the industrial nations went down to zero emissions -- remember what I just said, all the industrial emissions went down to zero emissions -- it wouldn't be enough, not when more than 65 percent of the world's carbon pollution comes from the developing world."" Being a liberal means never having to admit error. Liberalism, it appears, has always been about intentions and feelings, not results. Fighting ""climate change"" makes liberals feel good. There has been a near complete media blackout and intimidation of anyone presenting contrary scientific evidence disproving the theory that Earth is warming and humans are responsible. Quentin Letts, a BBC presenter, had his radio program pulled from the BBC's iPlayer playback facility for, according to him, showing ""disrespect for climate change,"" after protests from global warming adherents, which the UK Daily Mail later dubbed the ""Green Gestapo."" This phony doctrine is being shoved down our throats by people who continue to fly in private jets and ride in gas-guzzling SUVs while telling the rest of us to walk or ride bikes. Not that facts matter to the major media and others who have embraced the doctrines of this new religion, but here are some anyway because, in my opinion, belief in ""climate change"" is on a par with childhood faith in Santa Claus and the tooth fairy. Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) is a scientific research company located in Northern California, specializing in satellite microwave remote sensing of the Earth. According to RSS, the Earths temperature has not increased in the last 18 years and nine months, a record. As previously noted in this column, predictions of global warming have been based on imperfect computer models. That those models do not reflect reality has not affected the minds or policies of people who worship at the altar of government and wish to impose additional regulations on already overburdened corporations and individuals. In my opinion, belief in ""climate change"" is on a par with childhood faith in Santa Claus and the tooth fairy. As The Daily Caller website reported last June, ""Data from America's most advanced climate monitoring system shows the U.S. has undergone a cooling trend over the last decade, despite recent claims by government scientists that warming has accelerated worldwide during that time."" This reflects a pattern we have seen throughout history. In the 1970s, scientists and the media were promoting ""global cooling"" to advance their ""chicken little"" fantasy that life as we know it on Earth was about to end. They were wrong then and they are wrong now. But there is money and political power associated with climate change orthodoxy and next to sex, humans lust after these more than anything else. If you are a climate change disciple, or confused, do yourself a favor. Visit climatedepot.org and see the film ""Climate Hustle,"" which premiered in Paris during the UN gathering. The film attracted protestors largely because global warming cultists want to suppress any information that runs counter to their beliefs. There is nothing wrong and much right about the goal of reducing pollution, especially in China, the world's worst polluter, but ""global warming"" shouldn't be the reason. If John Kerry is right -- and the evidence suggests he is -- why would the U.S. and other developed countries stifle their growth potential by embracing a false doctrine that could lead to predictable and even unforeseen economic consequences? You will have to ask a climate change disciple.",15/12/2015,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/paris-climate-deal-nothing-but-hot-air

Portland public schools ban textbooks that cast doubt on climate change,"The Portland Public Schools board voted last week to ban any materials that cast doubt on climate change, the Portland Tribune reported. According to the resolution passed May 17, the school district must remove any textbooks and other materials that suggest climate change is not occurring or that says human beings are not responsible for it. A lot of the text materials are kind of thick with the language of doubt, and obviously the science says otherwise, said Bill Bigelow, a former Portland public school teacher who worked to present the resolution. Bigelow says textbook publishers are yielding to pressure from fossil fuels companies. We dont want kids in Portland learning material courtesy of the fossil fuel industry. One commenter to the Portland Tribune story responded to the news, saying, I have never seen a case for homeschooling more clearly put forward. This is further proof that public schools are not interested in education, only political indoctrination. A petition, meanwhile, circulated by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (OISM) currently lists nearly 32,000 signers, including 9,000 Ph.D.s, who say, there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth. Still, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says addressing the issue of global warming will help to improve public health, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report. ""I don't want people to think that EPA is just about big rules, or that climate change is just about polar bears,"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said. ""It really is about direct public health issues like asthma and kids, like cardiovascular and pulmonary disease associated with air pollution."" The Portland decision comes weeks after Yale University announced its climate change program will close at the end of June. The shuttering follows three consecutive years of budget cuts for the program, which was established eight years ago to conduct climate change research. The impending closure was announced in an email from the institutes co-directors, geology and geophysics professors David Bercovici and Jay Ague, and reported by the Yale Daily News. While not all good things have to come to an end, sometimes they just do, the email dated May 2 said.",22/05/2016,https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-public-schools-ban-textbooks-that-cast-doubt-on-climate-change
"Climate change poses 'significant risk' to US military, report says","U.S. military officers and national security officials reportedly believe climate change pose a very real threat to U.S. military operations and could increase the danger of international conflict. A Washington-based think tank, the Center for Climate and Security, said in a statement that climate change presents a strategically-significant risk to U.S. national security, and inaction is not a viable option. According to Reuters, the statement was endorsed by more than a dozen former senior military and national security officials. The group wants the next president to create a cabinet position to deal with climate change and its potential impacts on national security. The Center for Climate and Security published a separate report, arguing that extreme weather poses a threat to coastal military bases. ""The complex relationship between sea level rise, storm surge and global readiness and responsiveness must be explored down to the operational level, across the Services and Joint forces, and up to a strategic level as well,"" according to the report. Another report revealed earlier this year that faster sea level rises in the second half of the century could make tidal flooding a normal occurrence for some military installations. Climate change hasnt been a major focal point of the 2016 campaign. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called global warming a concept ""created by the and for the Chinese"" to hurt the U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wants to have the U.S. use 50 percent cleaner energy by 2030 and promised heavy fracking regulations.

Trump seems to be changing his mind on climate change,"Donald Trump on Tuesday backed away from his earlier statements that climate change was a hoax invented by the Chinese and said there was some connection between the climate and human activity. I think there is some connectivity. Some, something. It depends on how much, Trump told reporters from the New York Times during a meeting at the papers Midtown offices. Clean air is vitally important, he said, according to a series of live tweets by Times staffers. In response to a question, the president-elect also said he was considering whether to withdraw from the Paris agreement on reducing greenhouse gases. Im looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it, Trump said, while adding that he was also considering how much it will cost our companies and affect U.S. competitiveness.

Youth in Washington state sue government over climate change,"Eight children asked a state judge on Tuesday to find Washington in contempt for failing to adequately protect them and future generations from the harmful effects of climate change. The petitioners asked the judge to require the state Department of Ecology to come up with science-based numeric emissions reductions. The state argued that it has complied with the court's prior orders and there's no basis for finding the Department of Ecology in contempt. King County Superior Court Judge Hollis Hill said she needed more time to deliberate after she heard arguments on Tuesday. The case which is led by children ranging between 12 and 16 years old, is part of a national effort led by the Oregon-based nonprofit Our Children's Trust to force states and the federal government to take action on climate change. A similar climate change case was allowed to proceed in Oregon earlier this month. In that lawsuit, activists argued the governments actions violate their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property. ""The most concerning thing to me is that our planet will be destroyed and I would have done nothing about it,"" Aji Piper, a plaintiff in both the federal and Seattle cases said. ""We're bringing this case because we need to have a stronger voice and right now that's through the legal system."" The children's attorney, Andrea Rodgers told the judge on Tuesday that, ""Ecology has the legal authority and responsibility to remedy the ongoing legal violations of these young people's fundamental rights. Assistant Attorney General Kay Shirey said in court that the department complied with court orders by adopting its clean air rule requiring power plants, refineries and others large polluters to reduce emissions by an average 1.7 percent each year. Rodgers said that the case is not about the clean air rule but instead about the states constitutional and statutory duties in protecting the rights of young people from the dangers climate change pose. ""This is the world I'm going to have to grow up in,"" said Gabe Mandell, of Seattle, before the hearing. ""Ecology has a mandate to protect our future and they're not doing it. They're not doing their job and they're not doing what the judge ordered.""

Trump is wrong on climate change,"Climate change is happening; the question is what to do about it. President Obama had one answer: reduce greenhouse-gas emissions aggressively. Unfortunately, his approach was heavy on cost and light on benefit, and with yesterdays executive order rolling back those efforts, President Trump has rightly begun the process of reversing it. But President Trump's own response to climate change appears to be: nothing. Thats not the right answer either. Most climate policy falls into one of two categories: There is mitigation, which means trying to prevent climate change by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions -- think wind farms. And then there is adaptation, which means dealing well with whatever change occurs -- think sea walls. The basic problem with Obamas mitigation-focused approach is that the overwhelming majority of future emissions will come from the developing world as it grows rapidly. U.S. policy has shown little ability to influence that trend, even when we make brave commitments to incur large costs ourselves. We can -- and should -- invest in developing new technologies that might reduce emissions more cheaply, but that takes time, and success is not guaranteed. Without major mitigation, though, adaptation becomes all the more important. And that is a place where good American policy can make a major difference. For instance, continued research into the likely effects of climate change can inform policymakers and private actors about what to expect, so that they can make better investments. If certain areas of the country are likely to get wetter or drier, hotter or colder, we should want to know that. Yet the Trump Administration seems inclined -- at least so far -- to dismiss such research and cut its funding as aggressively as possible. The instinct is understandable, given the research sloppily conducted or misappropriated for activist ends under the previous Administration. The Obama-era EPA's Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis project, for example, managed to conclude that the rate of heat-related deaths for New York in the year 2100 would be 50 times higher than it was for Phoenix in 2000 -- even though New York would be nowhere near as hot in 2100 as Phoenix is already. But that egregious effort does not make good research less valuable. It just underscores the need for research to be well focused and insulated from politics. Similarly, we should want government planners at every level to take the best existing research into account as they make public investments and set policy that will influence others. If farmers and resort owners and mayors and naval planners all build with an eye toward how the future might change, then those changes as they arrive wont be so harmful or expensive. Yet, in addition to starting the repeal of costly mitigation efforts like Obamas Clean Power Plan, Trumps executive order entirely erases an Obama order aimed at preparing the United States for the impacts of Climate Change. Many of the points in that program still make sense. Perhaps the greatest mistake made by those who overinflate the risk of climate change is to forget that our society has a tremendous capacity to adapt and innovate. But it would also be a major mistake to forget that public policy can either foster or hinder that process. If President Trump dislikes his predecessors approach to adaptation he should put forward an alternative. Ignoring the problem entirely is one of the few things he can do that really would make it worse.",29/03/2017,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-is-wrong-on-climate-change
Scientists seek holy grail of climate change in Oman's hills,"Deep in the jagged red mountains of Oman, geologists are drilling in search of the holy grail of reversing climate change: an efficient and cheap way to remove carbon dioxide from the air and oceans. They are coring samples from one of the world's only exposed sections of the Earth's mantle to uncover how a spontaneous natural process millions of years ago transformed CO2 into limestone and marble. As the world mobilizes to confront climate change, the main focus has been on reducing emissions through fuel efficient cars and cleaner power plants. But some researchers are also testing ways to remove or recycle carbon already in the seas and sky. The Hellisheidi geothermal plant in Iceland injects carbon into volcanic rock. At the massive Sinopec fertilizer plant in China, CO2 is filtered and reused as fuel. In all, 16 industrial projects currently capture and store around 27 million tons of CO2, according to the International Energy Agency. That's less than 0.1 percent of global emissions  but the technology has shown promise. ""Any one technique is not guaranteed to succeed,"" said Stuart Haszeldine, a geology professor at the University of Edinburgh who serves on a U.N. climate body studying how to reduce atmospheric carbon. ""If we're interested as a species, we've got to try a lot harder and do a lot more and a lot of different actions,"" he said. One such action is underway in the al-Hajjar Mountains of Oman, in a quiet corner of the Arabian Peninsula, where a unique rock formation pulls carbon out of thin air. Peter Kelemen, a 61-year-old geochemist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, has been exploring Oman's hills for nearly three decades. ""You can walk down these beautiful canyons and basically descend 20 kilometers (12 miles) into the earth's interior,"" he said. The sultanate boasts the largest exposed sections of the Earth's mantle, thrust up by plate tectonics millions of years ago. The mantle contains peridotite, a rock that reacts with the carbon in air and water to form marble and limestone. ""Every single magnesium atom in these rocks has made friends with the carbon dioxide to form solid limestone, magnesium carbonate, plus quartz,"" he said as he patted a rust-colored boulder in the Wadi Mansah valley. ""There's about a billion tons of CO2 in this mountain,"" he said, pointing off to the east. Rain and springs pull carbon from the exposed mantle to form stalactites and stalagmites in mountain caves. Natural pools develop surface scum of white carbonate. Scratch off this thin white film, Kelemen said, and it'll grow back in a day. ""For a geologist this is supersonic,"" he said. He and a team of 40 scientists have formed the Oman Drilling Project in order to better understand how that process works and whether it could be used to scrub the earth's carbon-laden atmosphere. The $3.5 million project has support from across the globe, including NASA. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas driving climate change, which threatens political instability, severe weather and food insecurity worldwide, according to the United Nations climate body. Natural CO2 levels have risen from 280 to 405 parts per million since the Industrial Revolution, and current estimates hold that the world will be 6 C hotter by 2100. In 2015, 196 nations signed the Paris climate accords, agreeing to curb greenhouse gas emissions to levels that would keep the rise in the Earth's temperature to under 2 C. That has injected new urgency into the work underway in Oman, where Keleman's team recently spent four months extracting dozens of core samples, which they hope to use to construct a geological history of the process that turns CO2 into carbonate. ""It's like a jigsaw puzzle,"" said Nehal Warsi, 33, who oversees the drilling process. Around 13 tons of core samples from four different sites will be sent to the Chikyu, a state-of-the-art research vessel off the coast of Japan, where Keleman and other geologists will analyze them in round-the-clock shifts. They hope to answer the question of how the rocks managed to capture so much CO2 over the course of 90 million years  and to see if there's a way to speed up the timetable. Kelemen thinks a drilling operation could cycle carbon-rich water into the newly formed seabed on oceanic ridges far below the surface. Just like in Oman's mountains, the submerged rock would chemically absorb carbon from the water. The water could then be cycled back to the surface to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere, in a sort of conveyor belt. Such a project would require years more of testing, but Kelemen hopes the energy industry, with its offshore drilling expertise and deep pockets, will take interest. ""Ultimately, if the goal is to capture billions and billions of tons of carbon, that's where James Cameron comes in,"" he said, half joking, referring to the ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" director who has also pioneered undersea technology. Cameron himself piloted a submersible to the deepest point on Earth in 2012 and retrieved samples while filming ""Deepsea Challenge."" ""He hasn't responded to my messages yet,"" Kelemen said.",13/04/2017,https://www.foxnews.com/world/scientists-seek-holy-grail-of-climate-change-in-omans-hills
"Climate change might be affecting your sleep, study says","Rising temperatures caused by climate change seem to be disrupting Americas sleep patterns, according to a new study. A temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit causes three bad nights of sleep per 100 individuals per month. Across the United States, that amounts to 9 million sleepless nights a month and 110 million nights each year. Our study represents the largest ever investigation of the relationship between sleep and ambient temperature, the authors wrote, and provides the first evidence that climate change may disrupt human sleep. BRITISH GYM INTRODUCES 'NAPERCISE,' WHERE PEOPLE SLEEP INSTEAD OF WORK OUT Scientists have long known that a comfortable body temperature is key for a good nights sleep. But this research is the first to find a correlation between hotter-than-usual nights and an increase in self-reported sleeplessness. The findings were published May 26 in Scientific Advances. Nick Obradovich, lead author on the study, was driven to explore the relation between the two after a record heat wave tore through Southern California in 2015. Obradovich, who was a graduate student at the time, barely slept during the six-day stretch of 100-degree nights. He noticed his friends and classmates had also become way more tired and sluggish. 5 FOODS TO BOOST YOUR ENERGY IF YOU GOT A BAD NIGHT'S SLEEP To figure out if there was any connection, Obradovich and three other researchers collected data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of 765,000 Americans contacted between 2002 and 2011. The CDC randomly conducts public health surveys in which they call people and ask things like whether they wear their seatbelt, how easily they sunburn and how many nights of insufficient sleep theyve had in the past 30 days. The researchers then took this data and cross-referenced it with local weather station records to see if the respondents had experienced unusual nighttime temperatures. They had. Additionally, the study found that low-income families who cant afford air conditioners and senior citizens whose bodies are more susceptible to heat stress were affected the worst. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS Poor sleep has been connected to a magnitude of ills that include a weaker immune system, decreased brain function, obesity, cancer and heart disease. Sleep is just one of many other factors that ultimately combine into the broad perspective on human well-being, Obradovich told the Huffington Post.

Paris Agreement on climate change: US withdraws as Trump calls it 'unfair',"After days of drama and suspense, President Trump announced Thursday that his administration will exit the Paris climate agreement. ""So we're getting out,"" Trump said. ""The Paris accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States."" Trumps decision fulfills a campaign promise and satisfies strong Republican opposition to the global climate deal but also isolates the U.S. and is certain to bring condemnation from world leaders and critics in the scientific community. Leaving the accord aligns the United States with Syria and Nicaragua. Critics of the Paris agreement argue it hurts the economy but supporters say it will create jobs down the line. The Paris accord will undermine our economy, Trump said, adding that it puts us at a permanent disadvantage. Its time to exit, he said. The Paris Climate Agreement is a pact between nearly 200 nations to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to fight climate change. The U.S., the worlds second largest emitter of carbon, would be required to reduce fossil fuel emissions nearly 30 percent by 2025. Former President Barack Obama used his power as president to join the Paris Accord without a vote in the legislature. Similarly, Trump used his authority to call it quits. The former president weighed in on Thursdays news. Even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future, Im confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet weve got, Obama said in a statement. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called Trumps decision an abdication of American leadership and an international disgrace while former Vice President Al Gore said it was a reckless and indefensible action. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel applauded the news and credited Trump with delivering on his campaign promise to put American workers first. The president is sending a clear message that we will no longer remain beholden to burdensome international deals at the expense of our taxpayers, she said. I commend the president for making this decision that will save the U.S. economy from the loss of millions of jobs and trillions in economic output. Trump hyped-up his announcement Wednesday on Twitter  prompting American allies around the world to weigh in on the consequences of the U.S. withdrawing from the global pact. At a speech in Berlin, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that fighting climate change is a ""global consensus"" and an ""international responsibility."" Though there are no legal ramifications for pulling out of the accord, it does alienate America and diminish its standing as a global leader. Miguel Canete, the European Union's top climate change official, said the decision to pull out of the Paris accord makes it ""a sad day for the global community."" He also predicted that the EU would seek new alliances from the worlds largest economies to the most vulnerable island states, as well as U.S. businesses and individuals supportive of the accord. We are on the right side of history, he said. Trump, who announced his decision from the White House Rose Garden, campaigned against the climate agreement during the 2016 election season. As a candidate, Trump vowed to cancel the Paris climate deal during his first major policy speech on energy in March 2016. In that same speech, he slammed draconian climate rules and vowed to cut any funding for United Nations programs related to combatting climate change. In the past, Trump has refused to acknowledge that humans contribute to climate change and has dismissed it as a hoax. Though the Paris Climate Agreement is not legally binding, the decision to either stay or withdraw has been deeply polarizing not only with lawmakers but also members of Trumps inner circle. Trumps chief strategist Steve Bannon as well as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt had been pressing the president to exit the deal. Both sat in the front row during Thursdays announcement and applauded. Trumps daughter Ivanka as well as business leaders and other U.S. allies have been pushing pro-Paris agenda for weeks. Business leaders including Apple's Tim Cook and Teslas Elon Musk were among those who lobbied Trump to stay in the agreement. Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer tweeted, Generations of Americans will suffer the destructive effects of Trumps greedy, selfish, and immoral decision.

European leaders: climate change deal can't be renegotiated,"Top European leaders pledged Thursday to keep fighting against global warming as President Donald Trump announced he was pulling out of the Paris climate accord, but they rejected his suggestion that the deal could later be renegotiated. The leaders of France, Germany and Italy said in a joint statement that they regretted the United States' decision to withdraw from the accord, but affirmed ""our strongest commitment"" to implement its measures and encouraged ""all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change."" While Trump said the United States would be willing to rejoin the accord if it could obtain more favorable terms, the three European leaders said the agreement cannot be renegotiated, ""since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economics."" President Emmanuel Macron of France repeated that belief in an English-language speech from the presidential palace, unprecedented from a French president in an address at home. He said, ""I do respect this decision but I do think it is an actual mistake both for the U.S. and for our planet."" ""Wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: make our planet great again,"" Macron added. The European Union's top climate change official, Miguel Arias Canente, said in a statement that Trump's decision to leave the Paris accord made it ""a sad day for the global community,"" adding that the bloc ""deeply regrets the unilateral decision."" Canete also predicted that the EU would seek new alliances from the world's largest economies to the most vulnerable island states, as well as U.S. businesses and individuals supportive of the accord. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement ""a major disappointment"" and said it was ""crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues,"" according to his spokesman. Fiji's Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama, who in November will chair an annual climate summit in Germany, said he was deeply disappointed by Trump's decision and did what he could to try to persuade Trump to stick with the agreement as nations tackle ""the greatest challenge our planet has ever faced."" He said he was convinced the U.S. will eventually rejoin. Bainimarama said the decision is a grave disappointment for places like his Pacific island nation and U.S. coastal cities like New York and Miami that are vulnerable to climate change. He promised to do all he can to continue to forge a grand coalition to accelerate the momentum that has built since the Paris agreement. Norway's largest pension fund with 53 billion euro ($59.5 billion) in assets under its management said it would continue to invest in renewable energy despite the American president's decision, saying in a statement that ""Donald Trump is jumping off a train that has already left the station."" Chief executive Odd Arild Grefstad cited the growth of renewable energy in U.S. states such as Texas, New York and California as signs that ""the world has started the transition from fossil to a renewable economy."" Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea also regretted the U.S. move and reiterated their commitment to implement the agreement. In Tokyo, an irate Koichi Yamamoto, the environment minister, said ""I'm not just disappointed, but also feel anger."" Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso drew parallels to the U.S. setting up a plan to establish the League of Nations after World War I, only to back out later. ""Who created the League of the Nations? It was the United States who set up the League of the Nations. Then, once it started, who didn't join in? The United States. I think that's just how they are,"" he told reporters. In Mexico, former President Vicente Fox criticized Trump's move, saying on Twitter: ""He's declaring war on the planet itself."" Fox, who has clashed with Trump since last year's presidential campaign, said the U.S. leader's decision ""condemns this generation and those to come"" and would leave ""a dark legacy just to satisfy your greediness."" The U.S. Conference of Mayors said it strongly opposed Trump's action and vowed to continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, the group's vice president, said withdrawal from the agreement was ""shortsighted"" and called climate change a grave threat to coastal communities such as his, as well as the nation and the world. Inventor and entrepreneur Elon Musk said he would keep his promise to end his participation in two presidential councils after Trump issued his decision. ""Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,"" the CEO of electric car maker Tesla Inc. tweeted shortly after Trump officially withdrew the U.S. from the global climate pact. Meanwhile, General Motors, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, said it would continue its commitment to ""creating a better environment."" The automaker highlighted its development of the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle with 238 miles of range on a single charge and a net price of less than $30,000. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Co., also weighed in, saying: ""We believe climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities."" Before Trump announced his decision Thursday afternoon, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters during a visit to Berlin that fighting global warming was a ""global consensus"" and an ""international responsibility."" Without mentioning the U.S. specifically, Li said that ""China in recent years has stayed true to its commitment"" and pointed out that his was one of the first countries to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement. While traveling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and Pope Francis. Withdrawing would leave the United States as one of just three countries outside the agreement. The other two are Syria and Nicaragua. Russia joined the chorus speaking out for the climate accord. Speaking to reporters on Thursday before Trump's decision was announced, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said Russia ""thinks highly"" of the accords and sees no alternative to it. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that its implementation will not be as effective ""without the key signatories."" Scientists say Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could release up to 3 billion additional tons of carbon dioxide a year  enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather. ___ Associated Press writers David Rising and Frank Jordans in Berlin, Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow, Gregory Katz in London, Lorne Cooke in Brussels, Gerry Shih in Beijing, Peter Orsi in Mexico City, Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Colleen Barry in Milan, Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit, Matthew Daly in Washington and Edith M.

Stephen Hawking: Earth could turn into hothouse planet like Venus,"Earth could turn into a hothouse planet like Venus, with boiling oceans and acid rain, if humans don't curb irreversible climate change, physicist Stephen Hawking claimed in a recent interview. ""We are close to the tipping point, where global warming becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250 degrees [Celsius], and raining sulfuric acid,"" he told BBC News, referring to the president's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate deal. But most climate experts say that scenario is a dramatic and implausible exaggeration: Relative to Venus, planet Earth is much farther from the sun and given its chemical makeup will never have such a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, so it could not likely reach temperatures of 482 degrees Fahrenheit (250 degrees C) that Hawking described in the interview, they say. [Doomsday: 9 Real Ways the Earth Could End] However, the general trend of runaway and catastrophic climate change is a real concern, experts said. ""Hawking is taking some rhetorical license here,"" Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University, told Live Science in an email. ""Earth is further away from the sun than Venus and likely cannot experience a runaway greenhouse effect in the same sense as Venus  i.e. a literal boiling away of the oceans. However Hawking's larger point  that we could render the planet largely uninhabitable for human civilization if we do not act to avert dangerous climate change  is certainly valid."" Hothouse planet Venus is the second planet from the sun and the brightest planet in the solar system; though the planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and desire, don't expect to take a trip to the balmy planet with your sweetheart anytime soon. Despite being the same size as Earth and having roughly the same gravity as our home planet, it's a far cry from our water-drenched planet. Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with temperatures reaching 870 degrees F (466 degrees C). The reason for these sweltering temperatures is Venus' thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere that is dotted with sulfuric acid clouds; the atmosphere traps much more heat than our own does. It is also much closer to the sun, meaning it absorbs much more solar radiation than Earth. Churning volcanoes add to Venus' reputation as an inferno. [7 of the Hottest Places on Earth] The leading theory about how Venus came to be such a hellscape is that the planet got caught in a feedback loop, wherein the planet absorbed more solar radiation than it released, causing more water vapor to get trapped in its atmosphere. That, in turn, led to greater heat absorption, and runaway warming (also called a runaway greenhouse effect). ""Basically, Venus was in a state of heat stroke  the planet was in a warming state and it couldn't cool down,"" said Tyler Robinson, an astrobiologist at the University of Washington. Unlikely on Earth Though most humans take for granted the relative constancy of an Earth-like climate, our planet has undergone dramatic changes in its 4.5-billion-year history. During the Great Oxygenation Event, around 2.5 billion years ago, photosynthetic cyanobacteria fueled a huge rise in oxygen in the atmosphere. Around 650 million years ago, the entire planet froze, in a phenomenon known as "" snowball Earth ."" And during the dinosaur age, the planet was, on average 18 degrees F (10 degrees C) hotter than it is now, with a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. And huge ""carbon excursions"" have led to massive extinctions in the past  such as the end-Permian extinction around 252 million years ago, when roughly 95 percent of sea life died out due to ocean acidification. [ Photo Timeline: How the Earth Formed ] So it's not unreasonable to contemplate the possibility of a runaway climate scenario, Robinson said. Still, most experts, including Robinson, see that possibility as incredibly unlikely. While in theory, a process similar to the one experienced on Venus could take place on Earth, the process would most likely occur over hundreds of millions of years, most experts believe, Robinson said. There are also very low odds that Earth's oceans could literally boil away like Venus' primeval oceans did, Robinson said. Earth, meanwhile, is protected from solar radiation by an atmosphere that is dramatically different from that of Venus. ""Venus' atmosphere is about 100 times thicker than Earth's atmosphere, and composed almost entirely of CO2 [carbon dioxide],"" Robinson said. By contrast, Earth's atmosphere is mostly molecular nitrogen and oxygen, with less than 0.04 percent coming from carbon dioxide, Robinson told Live Science in an email. [ Infographic: Earth's Atmosphere from Top to Bottom ] Without a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and the extra dose of solar radiation from the sun, only willful malice is likely to cause a runaway greenhouse scenario, said Kevin Zahnle, a space scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, who has analyzed runaway greenhouse projections for the planet. ""There is no rational expectation of a runaway [greenhouse effect] in the facts as we know them,"" Zahnle told Live Science in an email. For one, there were much warmer climates on Earth in the relatively recent past, such as during the Eocene epoch (between 56 million and 34 million years ago), and no signs of a runaway greenhouse effect, Zahnle said. At that time, CO2 levels were likely three times higher than they are now. Even imagining a future with cars, planes and air conditioning on full blast, no climate projections predict such high levels of CO2 in our atmosphere, he said. ""A runaway greenhouse effect is not in the cards,"" added Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Of course, there is always the possibility of deliberate sabotage, Zahnle said. ""Dr. Evil might consider an engineering solution akin to the engineering solutions proposed to terraform Mars , but the scale of the effort would be stupendous,"" Zahnle said. ""You'd need fluorocarbons  so Dr. Evil would need to create a worldwide religion dedicated to the sacred use of hairspray and underarm deodorants,"" Zahnle said. (In the past, some consumer aerosol products contained fluorocarbons, though the U.S. has banned the ingredients in the late 1970s.) Climate catastrophe possible Nontheless, Earth doesn't have to become like Venus for life on Earth to become hellish. The Paris Agreement aimed to keep warming below 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) compared with preindustrial temperatures, but even reaching that level for sustained periods could cause changes that are already underway to completely disrupt ecosystems and farming, Trenberth told Live Science. [ Trump Pulls Out of Paris Climate Deal: 5 Likely Effects ] ""Trees will still grow but a different species is required. Or farming requires different crops,"" Trenberth said. ""That threatens the water and food supply."" Food and water don't need to vanish, they just need to fall below demand and chaos breaks out, he said. ""This sort of thing is increasingly likely after about 2050, as it is likely we will go through 2 degrees Celsius during that decade,"" Trenberth said. It is also theoretically possible for CO2 levels to go even higher, Robinson said. If humans were to burn every last bit of fossil fuel on the planet, CO2 levels could rise to almost 10 times their current levels, Robinson said. ""Earth hasn't experienced CO2 levels this high in hundreds of millions of years, and the resulting sea-level change is likely hundreds of feet, so, say 'so long' to all your favorite coastal cities,"" Robinson said.

Stephen Hawking: Earth could turn into hothouse planet like Venus,"Earth could turn into a hothouse planet like Venus, with boiling oceans and acid rain, if humans don't curb irreversible climate change, physicist Stephen Hawking claimed in a recent interview. ""We are close to the tipping point, where global warming becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250 degrees [Celsius], and raining sulfuric acid,"" he told BBC News, referring to the president's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate deal. But most climate experts say that scenario is a dramatic and implausible exaggeration: Relative to Venus, planet Earth is much farther from the sun and given its chemical makeup will never have such a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, so it could not likely reach temperatures of 482 degrees Fahrenheit (250 degrees C) that Hawking described in the interview, they say. [Doomsday: 9 Real Ways the Earth Could End] However, the general trend of runaway and catastrophic climate change is a real concern, experts said. ""Hawking is taking some rhetorical license here,"" Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University, told Live Science in an email. ""Earth is further away from the sun than Venus and likely cannot experience a runaway greenhouse effect in the same sense as Venus  i.e. a literal boiling away of the oceans. However Hawking's larger point  that we could render the planet largely uninhabitable for human civilization if we do not act to avert dangerous climate change  is certainly valid."" Hothouse planet Venus is the second planet from the sun and the brightest planet in the solar system; though the planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and desire, don't expect to take a trip to the balmy planet with your sweetheart anytime soon. Despite being the same size as Earth and having roughly the same gravity as our home planet, it's a far cry from our water-drenched planet. Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with temperatures reaching 870 degrees F (466 degrees C). The reason for these sweltering temperatures is Venus' thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere that is dotted with sulfuric acid clouds; the atmosphere traps much more heat than our own does. It is also much closer to the sun, meaning it absorbs much more solar radiation than Earth. Churning volcanoes add to Venus' reputation as an inferno. [7 of the Hottest Places on Earth] The leading theory about how Venus came to be such a hellscape is that the planet got caught in a feedback loop, wherein the planet absorbed more solar radiation than it released, causing more water vapor to get trapped in its atmosphere. That, in turn, led to greater heat absorption, and runaway warming (also called a runaway greenhouse effect). ""Basically, Venus was in a state of heat stroke  the planet was in a warming state and it couldn't cool down,"" said Tyler Robinson, an astrobiologist at the University of Washington. Unlikely on Earth Though most humans take for granted the relative constancy of an Earth-like climate, our planet has undergone dramatic changes in its 4.5-billion-year history. During the Great Oxygenation Event, around 2.5 billion years ago, photosynthetic cyanobacteria fueled a huge rise in oxygen in the atmosphere. Around 650 million years ago, the entire planet froze, in a phenomenon known as "" snowball Earth ."" And during the dinosaur age, the planet was, on average 18 degrees F (10 degrees C) hotter than it is now, with a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. And huge ""carbon excursions"" have led to massive extinctions in the past  such as the end-Permian extinction around 252 million years ago, when roughly 95 percent of sea life died out due to ocean acidification. [ Photo Timeline: How the Earth Formed ] So it's not unreasonable to contemplate the possibility of a runaway climate scenario, Robinson said. Still, most experts, including Robinson, see that possibility as incredibly unlikely. While in theory, a process similar to the one experienced on Venus could take place on Earth, the process would most likely occur over hundreds of millions of years, most experts believe, Robinson said.

5 major takeaways from the leaked climate change report,"Human activity is the dominant cause of the rapid rise in climate change, according to a leaked report. The New York Times obtained a draft of the 2017 U.S. Global Change Research Program's Climate Science Special Report, assembled by federal authorities. The report states that ""it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence."" A finalized version of the report is awaiting approval from President Trump and his administration. Here are five major takeaways from the report: 1. Global temperatures are rising The global average temperature increased by more than 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.7 degrees Celsius) in the last 30 years. The report states that average temperatures have risen faster in the past few decades than at any time in the past 1,700 years. Sixteen of the last 17 years were the warmest years on record. 2. Significant atmospheric changes are inevitable In the United States alone, the average annual temperature has increased by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since 1901. That number will only increase, according to the report. More record-setting years will be routine in decades to come. Urban areas will feel the change on a more dramatic scale due to urban heat island effects. 3. Humans are the dominant cause Human activity is the dominant cause of this warming since the mid-20th century. The report states that humans have caused 92 to 123 percent of the rise in temperature between 1951-2010. The authors did evaluate naturally occurring atmospheric phenomena such as El Nino, but found that natural influence was ""limited to a small fraction of observed climate trends over decades."" 4. Extreme weather events are happening more frequently Cold waves are dropping in frequency while heat waves are increasingly prevalent, the report states. Precipitation extremes are also becoming more common. Heavy precipitation events have surged in the U.S. since 1901, most dramatically in the Northeast. ""Recent droughts and associated heat waves have reached record intensity in some regions of the United States,"" the report said. More evaluation is needed to scientifically and definitively link climate change to a rise in hurricanes, tornadoes and winter storms. 5. Oceans are rising and heating up Oceans have been absorbing excess heat from greenhouse gas warming since the mid-20th century, the report states. Sea levels have risen between 7-8 inches (12-21 cm) since 1900. Roughly 3 of those inches (7 cm) are from 1993 to the present. Relative sea level rise is predicted to be higher in the northeastern U.S. and the western Gulf of Mexico than the rest of the globe. Sea level rise will likely ""increase the frequency and extent of extreme flooding associated with coastal storms, such as hurricanes and nor'easters,"" according to the report.",09/08/2017,https://www.foxnews.com/us/5-major-takeaways-from-the-leaked-climate-change-report.amp
John Stossel: Of course climate change is real! Climate changes -- it always has and always will,"""How many once-in-a-lifetime storms will it take,"" demands ""The Daily Show"" comic Trevor Noah, ""until everyone admits man-made climate change is real?!"" His audience roars its approval. When Hurricane Irma hit, so-called friends admonished me, ""Look what your fossil fuels have done! Will you finally admit you are wrong?"" No. It's the alarmists who are wrong -- on so many levels. First, two big storms don't mean much. The global warming activists must know that because when Donald Trump joked about a lack of warming on a snowy day, they lectured us about how ""weather is not climate -- one snowstorm is irrelevant to long-term climate."" They were right then. But now that bad weather has come, they change their tune. Time magazine reported confidently, ""Climate change makes the hurricane season worse."" But Irma and Harvey came after a record 12 years without any Category 3-5 storms. Over those 12 years, did Time say the absence of storms proved climate change fear exaggerated? No. Of course not. It seems logical that warmer water may make storms worse, but there's no proof of that. The government's own National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says neither its models ""nor our analyses of trends in Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm counts over the past 120-plus years support the notion that greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to large increases in either tropical storm or overall hurricane numbers."" As Irma approached, The Washington Post ran an even dumber headline: ""Irma and Harvey Should Kill Any Doubt That Climate Change Is Real."" That's phrased to make any skeptic look ridiculous. Of course climate change is real! Climate changes -- it always has and always will. For the past 300 years, since ""the little ice age,"" the globe warmed about three degrees. The warming started well before man emitted much carbon. So the real unanswered questions are: 1. Will climate change become a crisis? (We face immediate crises now: poverty, terrorism, a $20 trillion debt, rebuilding after the hurricanes) 2. Is there anything we can do about it? (No. Not now; the science isn't there yet.) 3. Did man's burning fossil fuels increase the warming? (Probably. But we don't know how much.) I resent how the alarmists mix these questions, pretending all the science is settled. Notice how Trevor Noah, above, tossed out the words ""man-made,"" as if all climate change is man-made? OK, he's just a comic, but New York Times writers constantly yammer about ""human-caused"" and ""man-made"" climate change, too. Politicians (and ex-politicians like Al Gore) are eager to exploit our fears by calling for more spending and regulation in the name of fighting deadly but preventable climate change -- as if feeble efforts like the Paris climate accord would have made the tiniest difference. They wouldn't. It's all for show. A video I made about this seems to have struck a chord. It got more than a million views over the weekend. Some people reacted with anger online: ""the scientific community suggest that humans are contributing to the warming of the planet. Isn't (it) at least a little reckless to put a finger in each ear and say 'Nuh uh! LALALALALALALALALA!'"" That would be reckless. But no one advocates that. We already spend a fortune on subsidies, mandates and climate research. The real questions are outlined above. A calmer commenter wrote, ""Don't forget the hurricanes of the past. 1926 Miami, 1935 Keys, 1947 West Palm Beach, Donna 1961. People act like hurricanes like these have never happened."" Right. And he left out Galveston's hurricane in 1900, which killed as many as 12,000 people. One commenter added, ""It's called El Nino and La Nina. We will be entering El Nino again (and) so seeing storms actually form. It shifts back and forth every 7-10 years or so. Do schools not teach these things?"" Climate fluctuates, and humans don't have too much to say about it. Maybe someday humans will be gone. The storms will continue. But at least there'll be less hot air.",13/09/2017,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/john-stossel-of-course-climate-change-is-real-climate-changes-it-always-has-and-always-will
Don't blame climate change: Hurricanes have always been and will always be with us,"After seeing the terrible flooding, property destruction, power outages and tragic deaths caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, we all wish we could do something to keep future hurricanes from forming or make them less severe. Unfortunately, we cant. But despite what you hear from environmental extremists  who oppose the use of oil, coal and natural gas  even if we stopped using these fossil fuels tomorrow hurricanes would still be part of our natural world. They always have been and always will be. Radical greens and their political and media allies have latched onto the suffering caused by Harvey and Irma to advance their ideological jihad against fossil fuels. They want to keep these valuable resources locked up underground and never used to provide the efficient, reliable and affordable energy that makes our economy and modern life possible. The extremists dont care that ending our use of fossil fuels would dramatically reduce our living standards by making energy much more scarce and expensive, or that the poor would suffer far more than the wealthy. My geology, ecology and natural resources background taught me that climate change has been real throughout our planets history, including long before humans walked the Earth. Some on the left are also using Harvey and Irma as yet another weapon in their non-stop attacks on President Trump, his administration, Republicans and our very way of life. My geology, ecology and natural resources background taught me that climate change has been real throughout our planets history, including long before humans walked the Earth. Ive studied climate change, spoken at length with dozens of renowned experts, and written numerous articles explaining climate, energy and environmental issues in lay terms. Ive learned to be humble, respectful and vigilant in the face of natures power; to recognize that climate change can range from beneficial or benign to harmful or unbelievably destructive; and to understand that the sun and other powerful natural forces totally dwarf whatever meager powers humans might muster in attempting to control Earths climate and weather. Hurricane Harvey marked the end of a record 12-year absence of Category 3 to 5 hurricanes hitting the U.S. mainland. If global warming was the reason our nation is being battered by major hurricanes this year, how do you explain their absence for the past dozen years? There hasnt been such a long period when the U.S. was free of major hurricanes since 1860 to 1869. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Hurricane Research Division counts ten Category 4 and 5 monster hurricanes in the U.S. between 1920 and 1969  but only three between 1970 and 2016, when our planet was warming more rapidly. If warming causes more severe hurricanes, the number of big storms should have been greater in the latter period and fewer in the earlier part of the 20th century. If Harveys rainfall was due to growing fossil fuel use and atmospheric carbon dioxide, how do you explain previous deluges like Hurricane Easy (45 inches in Florida in 1950), Tropical Cyclone Amelia (48 inches in Texas in 1978) and Tropical Storm Claudette (a record 43 inches in 24 hours on Alvin, Texas in 1979), when global fossil fuel use was much lower? Natural factors not affected by manmade climate change played a key role in enabling Harvey and Irma to strike with such devastating force. Consulting meteorologist Joe DAleo notes that hurricanes entering Texas are almost always very wet and often stall or meander. WeatherBELL Analytics chief forecaster Joe Bastardi explains that a large (and predicted) cool trough trapped Harvey and kept it from moving inland, enabling the Gulf of Mexico to feed it trillions of gallons of water for days, It was an unusual confluence of events, said Weather Channel founder John Coleman, but it was certainly not unprecedented. If there was a human factor in Harvey and Irma, climate alarmists need to explain exactly where it was, how big it was and what role it played. They must present hard evidence to show that fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions played a significant role compared to the hundreds of natural forces involved in these storms. They have done none of these things and cannot. The Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico are warm enough every summer to produce major hurricanes, says climatologist Roy Spencer. But you also need other conditions that have unknown origins and mechanisms: pre-existing cyclonic circulation off the African coast, upper atmospheric calm, and sea surface temperatures that change on a cyclical basis in various regions, to name just a few. The combination of all these factors  plus weather fronts and land masses along the way  determines whether a hurricane arises, how strong it gets, how long it lasts and what track it follows. Damage from hurricanes has certainly increased over the years. But thats because far more people now live and work in far more homes and businesses in many expensive communities along Americas Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Since 1920, Greater Houston grew from 138,000 people to 5.7 million; Miami from 43,000 to 6.1 million; Tampa from 50,000 to 3 million. Meanwhile, hurricane death tolls have declined dramatically over the years, despite much larger populations today in areas in the path of the storms. This is thanks in part to fossil fuels that enable us to construct stronger buildings; track storms; evacuate and rescue people; and bring in water, food, clothing, and materials to rebuild. Our Earth is a complex, wondrous, resilient planet. But it can unleash incredible fury. Wealthy, technologically advanced nations fueled by oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear power are far better able to avoid, survive and recover from those disasters.",16/09/2017,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dont-blame-climate-change-hurricanes-have-always-been-and-will-always-be-with-us
Neil deGrasse Tyson says human-caused climate change could doom coastal cities,"The United States ""might not be able to recover"" from climate change if extreme weather events and flooding continue to swamp the country's largest coastal cities, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson told CNN yesterday (Sept. 17). In an interview with reporter and TV host Fareed Zakaria on CNN's ""GPS,"" Tyson discussed hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which dumped rain and brought heavy winds and storm surges to Texas and Florida, respectively. When asked about Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert's response to the hurricanes  that is, declining to say whether climate change had intensified the storms  Tyson lost his patience. [Hurricane Harvey Before and After: Satellite Images Show Storm's Destruction] ""Fifty inches of rain in Houston!"" Tyson said, according to CNN. ""This is a shot across our bow, a hurricane the width of Florida going up the center of Florida!"" Research shows that human-caused climate change can make storms more extreme than they would be otherwise, Live Science reported previously. But humankind has been slow to curb the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, Tyson said, adding that the longer people take to respond to climate change, the bleaker the outcome for humanity gets. ""I worry that we might not be able to recover from this, because all our greatest cities are on the oceans and water's edges, historically for commerce and transportation,"" Tyson said on CNN. These cities will be the first to go as water levels rise, Tyson said. ""And we don't have a system  we don't have a civilization with the capacity to pick up a city and move it inland 20 miles [32 kilometers],"" he said. ""This is happening faster than our ability to respond. That could have huge economic consequences."" Expert response Tyson's assessment of climate change's role in intensifying the recent hurricanes is spot-on, said Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University. ""There are theoretical reasons to expect that the strongest storms will increase in intensity as sea-surface temperatures increase, and this is indeed being observed,"" Mann told Live Science in an email. For instance, for every 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.56 degrees Celsius) of ocean warming, there has been about a 10 mph (16 km/h) increase in maximum sustained winds among Category 4 and Category 5 hurricanes, Mann said. This is bad news for coastal cities: These faster winds correspond to a roughly 20 percent increase in wind damage, Mann said. Human-caused climate change has heated not only the land but also the ocean, Live Science previously reported. Warmer oceans have consequences  ""a warmer ocean surface means more moisture content and more rainfall with these storms, and global sea-level rise has increased the coastal flooding associated with these storms,"" Mann said.

Pope Francis says those who deny climate change have 'perverse attitudes',"Pope Francis blasted global warming skeptics on Thursday as having ""perverse attitudes."" The pontiff, during remarks made to negotiators at climate talks in Germany, called climate change ""one of the most worrisome phenomena that humanity is facing."" He added efforts to combat climate change are held back by those who deny the science behind it, are indifferent or resigned to it, or think it can be solved by technical solutions. ""We must avoid falling into these four perverse attitudes, which certainly don't help honest research and sincere, productive dialogue,"" he said. He urged negotiators at the Bonn meeting to take action free of special interests and political or economic pressures, and to instead engage in an honest dialogue about the future of the planet. Negotiators at the Bonn meeting are working to implement the 2015 Paris Climate Accord aimed at capping global emissions. The pope did not cite any countries by name, but President Trump previously announced the United States is withdrawing from the Paris accord. In 2016, Francis said global warming is ""mainly"" due to human activity and he called for fossil fuels to be progressively phased out without delay.

"Climate change forcing Santa to move to South Pole, Canadian government says","A Canadian government website claims that global warming is forcing Santa Claus to relocate his toy-making village to the South Pole. The Policy Horizons Canada website said last week that Santa signed an agreement with the international community to move his operation to the South Pole because of melting Arctic ice. Santas relocation agreement marks the first time that the international community agrees on a common legal definition of climate change that includes refugees as corporations, as well as individuals, the website said. ""This deal is expected to lead to the deployment of a global climate change refugee visa system that in the near future could help to more easily relocate individuals and corporations facing the impacts of climate change. The statement comes as part of a series of Christmas-themed blog posts about Canadian policy concerns, including global warming, the Daily Caller reported. Scientists recently warned that global warming could increase the amount of poverty and hardship in the world. Europe would also see a surge in climate refugees, according to a study. Experts have long warned that rising temperatures and extreme weather could increase the number of people in poor countries seeking refuge in richer, more temperate nations, but the phenomenon has previously been studied only at a small scale.

"Catastrophic global warming less likely, study says","Dire warnings of underwater cities and drowning polar bears are less likely to pan out than once thought. Thats an upshot of a new study in the journal Nature by top climate scientists, including a lead author of U.N. climate estimates. The studys conclusion says it is renewing hope that we may yet be able to avoid global warming exceeding [3.6 F]. For the last 25 years, the UN has had the same prediction of the impact of carbon dioxide: That will warm the Earth by between 2.7  8.1 degrees Fahrenheit if emissions continue at the current rate and levels end up at double the pre-industrial level. 'ARBITRARY' ADJUSTMENTS EXAGGERATE SEA LEVEL RISE, STUDY FINDS But the latest study uses a new method to determine that the actual likely range of warming would be narrower: between 4  6.1F. The study finds just a 1% chance of an increase over 8.1F degrees. Past models have over-predicted warming. A 2013 study in the journal Nature Climate Change found that out of 117 climate predictions made in the 1990's, three were roughly accurate and 114 overestimated warming. The new study takes that and more into account by looking at many past climate models as well as historical data. The new model better estimates future changes based on the fluctuations seen in historical data, study co-author Chris Huntingford, a climate modeler at the U.K.s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, told Fox News. CLIMATE SCIENTISTS CRITICIZE GOVERNMENT PAPER THAT ERASES PAUSE IN WARMING While the study anticipates less warming than before, the authors caution that governments must still work hard to prevent global warming. The current warming of one degree Celsius [1.8 F] has already changed our climate significantly. The frequency of heat waves has increased, lead author Peter Cox, a mathematics professor at the University of Exeter, told Fox News. Cox has been a lead author on the UNs past climate estimates. He says that expected warming is in the sweet spot for where action makes sense. Climate sensitivity is high enough to demand action, but not so high that it is too late to avoid dangerous global climate change, Cox said in a press release. CLIMATE CHANGE BRINGS NEEDED RAIN TO AFRICA Some skeptics say that the new analysis relies on too many assumptions to be confident about its results. I think the method needs more work before the results are convincing, climate scientist Judith Curry, the former chair of climate science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, told Fox News. However, their conclusion of lower sensitivity (less warming) is generally consistent with my own research, she added. Anthony Watts, a meteorologist and climate change blogger at Watts Up With That, told Fox News that all models are suspect until the impact of clouds on temperature is better understood  and that governments shouldnt try to reduce emissions. NYU FACULTY SENATE RECOMMENDS ENDING FOSSIL FUEL INVESTMENTS The market is going to drive the solutions... it is very active in trying to create alternative solutions, he said. The study authors maintain the importance of government intervention. To those skeptical of climate change, our paper does not say the climate change problem has gone away. It instead indicates very low levels of climate change or very high levels of change are less likely, Huntingford told Fox News. Cox said: Further dangerous changes in the climate can be avoided by actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as moving to more renewable energy sources and replanting forest to remove carbon dioxide from the air.

"California cities and crazy climate change lawsuits - Do as I say, not as I do","California cities are learning the meaning of hypocrisy. They have sued Exxon and other energy companies for concealing the costs of climate change from investors and customers. But now these same cities have confessed to the markets that they have no idea whether the climate is changing and whether it will have any effect on their citizens. During the last year, Oakland, San Francisco, and several other California cities and towns took to the courts to set their own policies on global warming, even though no activity within their borders could make the slightest dent in worldwide temperatures. They filed lawsuits against Exxon and more than a dozen energy companies claiming that future rises in sea levels will literally erode property values.  They demand that the companies fork over millions to remedy this imminent economic calamity. Put aside for the moment the absurdity of pinning sole responsibility for the effects of climate change on a handful of companies. Climate change is a worldwide phenomenon to which human activity for decades, if not centuries, has contributed.  Scholars continue to argue how much global temperatures will change in the future, which conduct is responsible, and whether reducing it is worth the costs in reduced economic growth. Californians have certainly not restrained themselves in the cause of climate control: they have a love affair with driving, especially Angelenos, many of whom seem to hate public transportation almost as much as they hate big oil. Californians have certainly not restrained themselves in the cause of climate control: they have a love affair with driving, especially Angelenos, many of whom seem to hate public transportation almost as much as they hate big oil. Also put aside for a moment the factual errors in the municipalities suits. Exxon, in particular, has acknowledged the link between fossil fuel use and climate change, supported the Paris climate agreement, and even backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax (which we did not). Yes, it is a fossil fuel company but far from concealing the truth, Exxon has been more than willing to adapt to changing climate awareness. Can the lawsuits even show how much Exxon has individually contributed to changes in global temperature?  If San Francisco and Oakland are suing Exxon, why dont they also sue every company in China and India?  The economic growth of these two developing giants no doubt has contributed far more to global warming than any American company or the United States in general. Instead, consider the hypocrisy laid bare this week in an Exxon court filing.  It points out that many of the California towns and cities took the exact opposite position in their municipal bond offerings.  When borrowing money, they took pains to insulate themselves from liabilities stemming from climate change when offering bonds to investors.  Some said they had no way to predict accurately risk related to rising sea levels or climate change or simply failed to mention such risks.  Apparently, these cities and towns believe it is better to tell the truth to the markets in New York City than to judges and jurors in court. For example, in its bond offering in 2017, Santa Cruz states, Areas within the county may be subject to unpredictable climatic conditions, such as flood, droughts and destructive storms. And yet, in its lawsuits against the energy companies, Santa Cruz declared with righteous certainty that there is a ...a 98% chance that the County experiences a devastating three-foot flood before the year 2050, and a 22% chance that such a flood occurs before 2030. In its 2017 bond offering, San Francisco acknowledged, The City is unable to predict whether sea-level rise or other impacts of climate change or flooding from a major storm will occur, when they may occur, and if any such events occur, whether they will have a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial condition of the City and the local economy. But in its lawsuit, the city declared, Global warming-induced sea level rise is already causing flooding of low-lying areas of San Francisco... And this was even before smoking marijuana became legal in California. These contradictions only underscore the highly political origin and motivation of the city lawsuits. The plaintiffs lawyers include Matthew Pawa, long regarded as an innovative and entrepreneurial strategist when it comes to using the court room as a substitute for the legislature to advance climate change orthodoxy. It is no coincidence that Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, a large plaintiffs firm based in Seattle, recently announced that it is expanding its environmental practice by acquiring the Pawa Law Group.  Municipalities likely welcome the chance to outsource the costs of litigation to firms working on a contingency basis. Rulings by environmentalist-friendly judges could mean a big pay day for all, giving new meaning to the green movement. In a petition filed in Texas court early this week, Exxon lays out the conflict between what the cities have told judges and what they have told the bond markets. Exxon is asking the court to require government officials to answer questions under oath about those statements. The case could have broad implications for the bond markets, as investors could have legal grounds to challenge the local governments for similar inconsistencies.  In the end, the cities mismanagement will come home to roost in higher borrowing costs and, ultimately, higher taxes for their residents.",19/02/2018,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/california-cities-and-crazy-climate-change-lawsuits-do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do
"Rep. Lamar Smith: Climate change and the scientific method - we should welcome new research, not resist it","Climate alarmism has become the chant of the media and liberals who favor more government regulations. As Chairman of the House Science Committee, I have challenged the alarmist rhetoric and pursued the facts about climate change. The Committee follows the scientific method, which welcomes critiques, avoids exaggerated predictions, and relies on unbiased data. Unfortunately, alarmists ignore all these principles. Those of us who subscribe to the scientific method by questioning assertions are wrongly labeled climate denier. So much for welcoming critiques. While I have never denied that the climate is changing, I have asked tough questions about how much the climate has changed and how much of an impact humans have had on the climate. Furthermore, I have supported technological innovation, rather than costly federal regulations and mandates, as the solution to a changing climate. On the other hand, climatologist Dr. Stephen Schneider has said, ...we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. His message is clear: never express doubt and never accept any critiques. And the Los Angeles Times refuses to publish opinion pieces from anyone the paper deems a denier. The paper should present both sides of controversial issues, not just their side. Climate alarmists seek to silence those whose research raises doubts. Instead of claiming that the science is settled, alarmists should welcome new research that furthers the science of climate change. Instead of claiming that the science is settled, alarmists should welcome new research that furthers the science of climate change. Alarmists also violate the second tenant of the scientific method, avoiding exaggerated predictions. Since the late 1970s, climate scientists have told the American people that global temperatures would increase more than one degree Celsius by 2020. However, actual satellite temperature observations do not support these predictions. Observed temperatures were less than half as high as the climate models predictions. When the predictions are so far off, we should not make policy decisions based on them. Much more research into the complexity of changing temperatures is needed. Furthermore, the idea that anyone can make precise predictions of what kind of climate will exist 85 or more years from now is laughable. There is simply no way to take into consideration climate variables or technological breakthroughs. Commenting on the recent hurricanes, many climate scientists have tried to link these storms and climate change. But the historical record disproves them. Hurricane landfalls in the United States since 1900 are on a steady decline. The cost of damages from these storms, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is also shrinking. Even the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has affirmed that they have low confidence in climate change contributing to extreme weather. Examination of patterns of other extreme weather events in the United States shows that a changing climate does not increase the frequency of these events. For example, U.S. wildland fires are decreasing in frequency. The number of recorded fires in recent years is nearly one-fourth the number of fires observed in the 1970s. Climate alarmists just wont let the facts get in the way of their science fiction. The third tenant of the scientific method, reliance on unbiased data, is violated by climate alarmists who present the American people with suspect data to advance a political agenda. For example, some claim that the Paris Climate Accord will reduce global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius. They have barraged the American people with this falsehood to garner support for the deal. But MIT data shows that the agreement would decrease warming only 0.16 degree Celsius by 2100  over 80 years from now  and only if all 195 countries completely abided by the agreement. While I am sure that the alarmists will continue to shout fire when there is none, I believe the American people will call their bluff and insist that the scientific method be followed. The way to address climate change is not by increasing regulations and taxes. The future lies with research and development. Forget the alarmists hysteria and look to technology and innovation to solve climate change challenges.",12/03/2018,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-lamar-smith-climate-change-and-the-scientific-method-we-should-welcome-new-research-not-resist-it
Steve Forbes: Lefty mayors' frivolous climate change lawsuits need to stop,"Who or what is actually responsible for global warming and how should the individuals, businesses or industry sectors be held accountable? If you listen to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the California mayors of San Francisco, Oakland, Richmond and others, the entire blame rests exclusively with our oil and natural gas industry. Conveniently, these money-hungry mayors and their equally greedy trial lawyers accuse only the largest, most profitable oil and natural gas companies of wrongdoing. Their municipal lawsuits allege that global warming is a local, public nuisance issue and the sole perpetrators of our planets warming are no farther away than the local refinery or natural gas plant. Sound unfair? Add this insane reasoning to the fact that dozens of other industrialized nations are apparently blameless for any of the planets climate-related woes. Operators of airlines, asphalt factories, cement plants, auto dealerships and heavy machinery in New York or California are likewise off the hook for any climate change-related issues. These lefty mayors suggest that because the earths climate is changing, they might incur expenses years down the road for possible sea level rise, storms, etc., so they want our oil and natural gas producers to pay hundreds of billions in undefined damages. A U.S. district judge in California scheduled a hearing to listen to both sides of the debate in a tutorial on climate change. While the energy industry presented logical facts, trial lawyers representing these liberal metropolises offered a tried-and-failed retread of legal claptrap. Importantly, the judge dismissed the notion of a conspiracy by energy companies to suppress global warming science.  Referring to one of the documents he reviewed, the judge said, I read that paragraph 67 the same way; that there was a conspiratorial document within the defendants about how they knew good and well that global warming was right around the corner.  And I said: Okay. That's going to be a big thing. I want to see it. Well, it turned out it wasn't quite that. In 2011, six Midwest power companies faced the same legal nonsense. The cases were tossed by the U.S Supreme Court, with liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing the majority opinion in the 8-to-0 decision. A few years ago, several liberal state attorneys general attempted to sue Exxon for alleged damages associated with climate change, attracting fawning praise from the liberal press. But headlines often fall short of actual facts in court and in every claim, the state AGs quietly retreated from their cases or let them fall inactive.  In 2011, six Midwest power companies faced the same legal nonsense. The cases were tossed by the U.S Supreme Court. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in the 8-to-0 decision which ruled that American corporations cannot be sued under local nuisance ordinances regarding greenhouse gas emissions as the climate change issue falls under the jurisdiction of Congress and the EPA, which, according to Ginsburg, are better equipped to do the job than individual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case decisions. Ginsburg warned that turning the jurisdiction of climate change over to local courts would create a quagmire of dissenting legal opinions across the country and allow an individual district judge to become a super EPA. The truth is America should embrace its energy industry and halt these unfounded efforts to sabotage our vital energy sector. The surge of American shale oil and natural gas production has fundamentally improved the U.S. economy and led the way in lowering CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases. In 2005, after the nations shale drilling revolution began, C02 emissions began to fall. U.S. energy-related carbon emissions fell 14 percent below the 2005 level in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). It wasnt due to renewable fuels that still represent less than 5 percent of our national energy grid. Our nations drop in C02 emissions came as our manufacturing and energy sectors began a decisive shift toward natural gas. The markets move to relatively clean-burning natural gas has been so profound that even if Barack Obama had never decreed the Clean Power Plan, the United States would have  already met the CPPs carbon dioxide reduction target for 2025, according to a recent Carnegie Mellon University report. Our U.S. oil and gas industry has invested $90 billion on emission control technologies between 2000 to 2014, according to a report by T2 and Associates. Just between 2013 and 2014 alone, the industry directly reduced emissions by the equivalent of 55.5 million metric tons of CO2  equal to taking 11.8 million cars off of the road. Methane emissions from venting and flaring associated with onshore petroleum production declined 40 percent just between 2015 and 2016, according to a new EPA report. The five biggest energy companies -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., BP Plc and Total SA -- collectively curbed combined emissions an average of 13 percent between 2010 and 2015, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. These city officials should face securities fraud charges because theyve been caught telling bond investors how any risks associated with climate change in their cities are hardly measurable, while in court they argue how the sky is falling. Sadly, this matter will likely have to go back to the Supreme Court after the left leaning 9th Circuit Court of Appeals surprised no one by allowing these state-by-state cases to advance. In the meantime, our energy producers will have to fend off more groundless charges as they work to provide affordable, reliable energy for us all.",05/04/2018,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/steve-forbes-lefty-mayors-frivolous-climate-change-lawsuits-need-to-stop
Los Angeles painting city streets white in bid to combat climate change,"California officials are hoping their latest attempt to stem the rising tides of climate change leads to a more socially conscious -- and cooler -- summer. Officials in Los Angeles have been painting streets white to reduce the effect of urban ""heat islands"" and combat the effects of climate change. The LA Street Services began rolling out the project last May, which preliminary testing shows has reduced the temperature of roadways by up to 10 degrees. The project involves applying a light gray coating of the product CoolSeal, made by the company GuardTop. ""CoolSeal is applied like conventional sealcoats to asphalt surfaces to protect and maintain the quality and longevity of the surface,"" according to the company website. ""While most cool pavements on the market are polymer based, CoolSeal is a water-based, asphalt emulsion."" While each coasting could can last up to seven years, they are also pricey, with the estimated cost of $40,000 per mile, the L.A. Daily News reported. CoolSeal does pass the California skid test in addition to the slip test for wet traction, and is applied in two coats, each 50 microns thick, over an asphalt roadway or a slurry-sealed asphalt roadway, according to the streets department. BOY, 13, FOUND ALIVE AFTER FALLING INTO LOS ANGELES DRAINAGE DITCH 'MAZE' By reducing the temperature of the city streets, officials say it can help reduce temperatures in the neighborhoods where the sealant is applied. With its numerous streets and freeways, Los Angeles suffers from the ""heat island"" effect, which causes urban regions to become warmer than their rural surroundings, forming an ""island"" of higher temperatures. ""Heat islands occur on the surface and in the atmosphere,"" according to the Environmental Protection Agency. ""On a hot, sunny summer day, the sun can heat dry, exposed urban surfaces, such as roofs and pavement, to temperatures 5090F hotter than the air1, while shaded or moist surfacesoften in more rural surroundingsremain close to air temperatures."" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who may make a run for president in 2020, has used the project as part of an overall plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the city by 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2025. ""Climate change is a fact of life that people in Los Angeles and cities around the world live with every day. It is a grave threat to our health, our environment, and our economy  and it is not debatable or negotiable,"" he said in a statement last year after President Trump said he would walk away from the Paris Climate Agreement.",10/04/2018,https://www.foxnews.com/us/los-angeles-painting-city-streets-white-in-bid-to-combat-climate-change
Trump sculpture on Arctic glacier planned as climate-change protest,"Although President Donald Trump might be skeptical of climate change (or global warming, if you prefer), activists in Finland hope to use the commander-in-chief's likeness to draw awareness to the issue. They plan to carve Trump's image into the side of an Arctic glacier. The group, called Melting Ice, is looking to raise 400,00 Euros (about $476,988) to fund ""Project Trumpmore,"" and create the roughly 115 foot-tall ice sculpture in a glacier that is melting, yle.fi reported. ""We don't simply want to build a monument, we want the project to be bigger and raise the topic of climate change on a broader scale, so that people talk more about climate change,"" Nicolas Prieto, the group's leader, told the site. Often people only believe something when they see it with their own eyes,"" he added. The sculpture would be built somewhere in the Arctic as the melting ice has symbolic meaning, Prieto said. Trump has doubted a human connection to climate change and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, calling it very unfair. The accord is a pact with 200 other nations aimed at voluntarily reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change.

New NASA chief Bridenstine says humans contribute to climate change 'in a major way',"In a NASA town hall yesterday (May 17), NASA's new administrator, Jim Bridenstine, said that he knows Earth's climate is changing, and that humans contribute to it ""in a major way,"" also supporting NASA's research into that important area. The statement is significant because Bridenstine has expressed doubt about human-caused climate change in the past, causing some to question his suitability to lead a fact-focused NASA. In 2013, as an Oklahoma congressman, Bridenstine claimed there was no current trend toward global warming. More recently, such as in his NASA administrator confirmation hearings last November, he has acknowledged that human activity contributes to climate change. But he had stopped short of saying that humans are the phenomenon's primary cause. At the NASA employee town hall, Bridenstine described how his thinking had ""evolved"" on the topic and laid out his current beliefs. ""I don't deny the consensus that the climate is changing; in fact, I fully believe and know that the climate is changing,"" he said. ""I also know that we, human beings, are contributing to it in a major way. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. We're putting it into the atmosphere in volumes that we haven't seen, and that greenhouse gas is warming the planet. ""That is absolutely happening, and we are responsible for it,"" he added. ""NASA is the one agency on the face of the planet that has the most credibility to do the science necessary so that we can understand it better than ever before."" Bridenstine's support of climate change research is in contrast to what many might expect from the current presidential administration: For instance, five Earth science and climate missions were written out of the White House's proposed 2018 NASA budget, and last year President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the worldwide Paris Agreement to limit climate change. Responding to a specific question on one of those cut climate missions, the Orbital Carbon Observatory Mission 3, Bridenstine said that, in his understanding, the mission is still set to launch in January 2019 after being funded by Congress. Bridenstine reassured NASA employees that the agency will follow the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) guidelines that studying climate change is a top priority  particularly, reducing ""climate uncertainty"" by studying how interactions between the water cycle and energy cycle affect the changing climate, as well as looking at the impact of climate change on ecosystems. ""We need to make sure that NASA is continuing to do the science, and we need to make sure that the science is void and free from partisan or political kind of rhetoric,"" he said. ""We have guidance from an apolitical, nonpartisan National Academy of Science telling us what is important for humanity, and we're going to follow it."" Bridenstine noted that NASA also says to prioritize weather and air-quality forecasting. His 2013 claim was that too much research is done into climate change instead of weather forecasting. Now, if his words to NASA employees are any guide, Bridenstine seems committed to supporting both.

"Climate change killed the aliens, and it will probably kill us too, new simulation suggests","Did climate change already kill all the aliens we've been searching for? According to astrophysicist Adam Frank, it's certainly a possibility  and whether humans are doomed to the same fate may already be out of our hands. Frank, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester in New York, is the lead author of a new paper published May 1 in the journal Astrobiology that aims to take what Frank calls a ""10,000-light-year"" view of anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. Using mathematical models based on the disappearance of a real-life lost civilization here on Earth (the former inhabitants of Easter Island), Frank and his colleagues simulated how various alien civilizations might rise and fall if they were to increasingly convert their planet's limited natural resources into energy. [12 Possible Reasons We Haven't Found Aliens] ""The laws of physics demand that any young population, building an energy-intensive civilization like ours, is going to have feedback on its planet,"" Frank said in a statement. ""Seeing climate change in this cosmic context may give us better insight into what's happening to us now and how to deal with it."" The results, as you might expect, were generally pretty grim. Of four common ""trajectories"" for energy-intense civilizations, three ended in apocalypse. The fourth scenario  a path that involved converting the whole alien society to sustainable sources of energy  worked only when civilizations recognized the damage they were doing to the planet, and acted in the right away. ""The last scenario is the most frightening,"" Frank said. ""Even if you did the right thing, if you waited too long, you could still have your population collapse."" Three paths to apocalypse For Frank, the path to modeling an apocalypse starts with Easter Island. ""Easter Island presents a particularly useful example for our own purposes since it is often taken as a lesson for global sustainability,"" Frank and his colleagues wrote in the paper. ""Many studies indicate that Easter Island's inhabitants depleted their resources, leading to starvation and termination of the island's civilization."" Working from previous equations that modeled the fall of Easter Island's population alongside the depletion of its resources, the team found four possible end points for a hypothetical alien civilization similarly constrained by limited natural resources. ""The first trajectory we found is what we call the die-off,"" Frank said. In this scenario, the civilization's population skyrockets over a short period of time, and as the aliens guzzle energy and belch out greenhouse gases, the planet's temperature spikes, too. (In this study, temperature was used to represent human-made impacts on the planet's habitability via greenhouse gas pollution.) The population peaks, then suddenly plummets as rising temperatures make survival harder and harder. The population eventually levels off, but with a fraction of the people who were around before. [Doomsday: 9 Real Ways the World Could End] ""Imagine if seven out of 10 people you knew died quickly,"" Frank said. ""It's not clear a complex technological civilization could survive that kind of change."" The second scenario is sustainability. Here, both the planet's population and its global temperature climb rapidly but then level off when the civilization recognizes how its resource management is affecting nature. To reach an equilibrium, Frank said, the population would need to switch from resources that take a high toll on the planet (like oil) to more sustainable resources (like solar energy). Civilization is saved! Both the third and fourth scenarios are called ""collapse."" Here, as in the ""die-off"" scenario, both the planet's population and the planet's temperature rise dramatically over a short period. But this time, when people start dying from a lack of basic resources, there are no survivors. Whether a civilization merely dies off or totally collapses depends on how sensitive the environment is and how quickly it responds to rising populations. Even if the civilization realizes it's damaging the environment and makes attempts to switch to sustainable resources  a scenario called ""collapse with resource change""  it's too late. The civilization might see a temporary slowing in the population decline, but eventually, it drops to zero anyway. The damage is done; civilization is doomed. Act now while civilization lasts The difference between a sustainable future and a deadly collapse was largely dependent on a population's foresight  how soon they realized they were destroying their planet, and how quickly they took action. According to Frank, this difference should motivate humans to take climate change seriously. ""Across cosmic space and time, you're going to have winners  who managed to see what was going on and figure out a path through it  and losers, who just couldn't get their act together and their civilization fell by the wayside,"" Frank said. ""The question is, which category do we want to be in?""

Francis made the appeal at a Vatican conference marking the third anniversary of his landmark environmental encyclical ""Praise Be."" The document, meant to spur action at the 2015 Paris climate conference, called for a paradigm shift in humanity's relationship with Mother Nature. In his remarks, Francis urged governments to honor their Paris commitments and said institutions like the IMF and World Bank had important roles to play in encouraging reforms promoting sustainable development. ""There is a real danger that we will leave future generations only rubble, deserts and refuse,"" he warned. The Paris accord, reached by 195 countries, seeks to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change by curbing global greenhouse gas emissions via individual, nonbinding national plans. U.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. will pull out of the accord negotiated by his predecessor unless he can get a better deal. Friday's conference was the latest in a series of Vatican initiatives meant to impress a sense of urgency about global warming and the threat it poses in particular to the world's poorest and most marginalized people. Recently, Francis invited oil executives and investors to the Vatican for a closed-door conference where he urged them to find alternatives to fossil fuels. He warned that climate change was a challenge of ""epochal proportions."" And next year, Francis has called a three-week synod, or meeting of bishops, specifically to address the church's response to the ecological crisis in the Amazon, where deforestation threatens what he has called the ""lung"" of the planet and the indigenous peoples who live there.

Climate change strengthens Earth's 'heartbeat' - and that's bad news,"It's no secret that human activity is changing the climate, and one new study shows how our influence is seriously affecting Earth's seasons and atmosphere. Climate change is much more than rising temperatures and melting ice. In a new study, scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and five otherorganizations show that human action significantly affects the seasonal temperature cycle in the troposphere, or lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere  the layer that we live in where weather occurs. These researchers used what is known as a ""fingerprint"" technique, in which they separated human influence from natural influence on climate. This allowed them to isolate human contributions and assess the specific effects of our species. And, while many fingerprint studies explore climate patterns over years and decades, this work shows how humans influence the changing seasons. [See the Effects of Climate Change Across Earth (Video)] In this new study, scientists examined seasonal temperature cycles in the troposphere and observed the profound impact humans are having on the atmosphere and our seasons. Most notably, the researchers found that because of carbon dioxide emissions, Earth's seasonal ""heartbeat,"" or the contrast between hot summers and cold winters, is becoming stronger. The team used temperature measurements taken by satellites to study changes in the size of the seasonal temperature cycle in the troposphere at different points on the planet's surface. In this way, the researchers could see the difference between summer and winter temperatures and the difference between warm and cold seasons. The investigators found that our summers are warming more rapidly than the other seasons as Earth's overall temperature rises, a phenomenon that is especially true in the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, the measured temperatures in the troposphere are consistent with models that suggest a strengthening seasonal heartbeat. ""Our results suggest that attribution studies with the changing seasonal cycle provide powerful and novel evidence for a significant human effect on Earth's climate,"" Benjamin Santer, LLNL climate scientist and lead author on the new work, said in a statement. Climate fingerprint research, which originated in the 1970's, studies climate patterns to find the source of large climate changes. It takes into account natural factors that contribute to climate like ocean heat, the water cycle, circulation in the atmosphere, sea ice, and extreme natural events, according to the statement. In this study, researchers studied model climate simulations driven by historical changes in human behavior. The team found a highly significant ""pattern match"" between seasonal temperature trends and the human influence, or ""fingerprint,"" on the troposphere, according to the statement. This shows that observed changes in our atmosphere and seasonal tropospheric temperature cycles are most likely caused by human action, the study said. This is the first formal fingerprint study that has ever been conducted with the changing seasonal tropospheric temperature cycle, according to the statement. This work was published July 20 in the journal Science. Original article on Space.com.",25/07/2018,https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-strengthens-earths-heartbeat-and-thats-bad-news
"Science Says: Record heat, fires worsened by climate change","Heat waves are setting all-time temperature records across the globe, again. Europe suffered its deadliest fire in more than a century, and one of nearly 90 large fires in the U.S. West burned dozens of homes and forced the evacuation of at least 37,000 people near Redding, California. Flood-inducing downpours have pounded the U.S. East this week. It's all part of summer  but it's all being made worse by human-caused climate change, scientists say. ""Weirdness abounds,"" said Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis. Japan hit 106 degrees on Monday, its hottest temperature ever. Records fell in parts of Massachusetts, Maine, Wyoming, Colorado, Oregon, New Mexico and Texas. And then there's crazy heat in Europe, where normally chill Norway, Sweden and Finland all saw temperatures they have never seen before on any date, pushing past 90 degrees. So far this month, at least 118 of these all-time heat records have been set or tied across the globe, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The explanations should sound as familiar as the crash of broken records. ""We now have very strong evidence that global warming has already put a thumb on the scales, upping the odds of extremes like severe heat and heavy rainfall,"" Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh said. ""We find that global warming has increased the odds of record-setting hot events over more than 80 percent of the planet, and has increased the odds of record-setting wet events at around half of the planet."" Climate change is making the world warmer because of the build-up of heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil and other human activities. And experts say the jet stream  which dictates weather in the Northern Hemisphere  is again behaving strangely. ""An unusually sharply kinked jet stream has been stuck in place for weeks now,"" said Jeff Masters, director of the private Weather Underground. He says that allows the heat to stay in place over three areas where the kinks are: Europe, Japan and the western United States. The same jet stream pattern caused the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Russian heat wave and fires, the 2011 Texas and Oklahoma drought and the 2016 Canadian wildfires, Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said, pointing to past studies by him and others. He said in an email that these extremes are ""becoming more common because of human-caused climate change and in particular, the amplified warming in the Arctic."" Climate scientists have long said they can't directly link single weather events, like a heat wave, to human caused climate change without extensive study. In the past decade they have used observations, statistics and computer simulations to calculate if global warming increases the chances of the events. A study by European scientists Friday found that the ongoing European heat wave is twice as likely because of human-caused global warming, though those conclusions have not yet been confirmed by outside scientists. The World Weather Attribution team said they compared three-day heat measurements and forecasts for the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland with historical records going back to the early 1900s. ""The world is becoming warmer and so heat waves like this are becoming more common,"" said Friederike Otto, a member of the team and deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. Erich Fischer, an expert on weather extremes at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich who wasn't part of the analysis said the authors used well-established methods to make their conclusions. Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said the link between climate change and fires isn't as strong as it is with heat waves, but it is becoming clearer. A devastating fire in Greece  with at least 83 fatalities  is the deadliest fire in Europe since 1900, according to the International Disaster Database run by the Centre for the Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels, Belgium. In the United States on Friday, there were 89 active large fires, consuming nearly 900,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. So far this year, fires have burned 4.15 million acres, which is nearly 14 percent higher than average over the past 10 years. The first major science study to connect greenhouse gases to stronger and longer heat waves was in 2004. It was titled ""More intense, more frequent and longer lasting heat waves in the 21st century."" Study author Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said Friday that now it ""reads like a prediction of what has been happening and will continue to happen as long as average temperatures continue to rise with ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels.

Earth's soil is hyperventilating thanks to climate change,"You know it's hot out there when even the soil is hyperventilating. According to a new study published yesterday (Aug. 1) in the journal Nature, there's about twice as much carbon dioxide (CO2) stored in Earth's soil as there is floating around the atmosphere, and for the last few decades, that underground greenhouse gas has been leaking out at a significantly increased rate. Based on more than 2,000 sources of climate data taken from ecosystems around the world, a team of soil scientists found that the rate of CO2 released from Earth's soil has increased globally by about 1.2 percent in just 25 years  and you can blame that on hot, hungry microbes. ""We're talking about a huge quantity of carbon,"" study co-author Vanessa Bailey, a soil scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state, said in a statement. ""Microbes exert an outsize influence on the world that is very hard to measure on such a large scale."" The breathing Earth Dirt doesn't actually breathe, of course, but it sort of looks that way when tiny, underground organisms help release the CO2 stored in plant roots, dead leaves and other natural detritus. Hungry microbes gorge on the tasty carbon stored in this plant matter, and then release carbon dioxide as a natural byproduct of this feeding, just as you do when you exhaleafter a deep breath. This process is known as ""soil respiration,"" and it's an important complement to photosynthesis  the process by which plants turn CO2, water and light into energy  helping to keep ecosystems around the world running smoothly. But lately, researchers have found that as global temperatures rise, microbes in the soil have been releasing CO2 faster than plants can snatch it up again. Previous studies have indicated that tree roots and certain microbes both respire more frequently at higher temperatures (up until a certain point, when the intense heat causes the organisms to stop functioning completely). But the exact effects of that increase in respiration had never been studied on a global scale until now. To better understand the potential links between rising global temperatures and soil respiration, a team of researchers led by Ben Bond-Lamberty at the Joint Global Change Research Institute at the University of Maryland, College Park, examined data from two huge global nature surveys: the Global Soil Respiration Database and FLUXNET, which collectively draw soil, temperature, rainfall and other data from a network of more than 2,000 sources across several ecosystems. The data showed that the rate of global soil respiration had increased by about 1.2 percent in the 25-year window between 1990 and 2014. Most of that growth was due to increased microbial action; the tiny creatures in Earth's soil are freeing more and more greenhouse gases from our planet's surface. The panting Earth While a 1.2 percent increase might not seem significant on its face, the researchers made it clear that even a modest change like this represents a ""massive"" ecosystem shift over a relatively short time. And while the full effects of this microbial huffing and puffing are hard to estimate, it's possible that all that extra CO2 will feed a self-intensifying loop of atmospheric warming and soil respiration over the years to come. ""Depending on how other components of the carbon cycle might respond due to climate warming, these soil changes can potentially contribute to even higher temperatures due to a feedback loop,"" Bond-Lamberty said in the statement. ""Soils around the globe are responding to a warming climate, which in turn can convert more carbon into carbon dioxide which enters the atmosphere."" The study has several limitations, the authors noted. The data examined came mainly from studies of the Northern Hemisphere and included only spotty surveys of high Arctic latitudes and the tropics, so does not represent a complete picture of the planet's soil. It's also very hard to tease out cause and effect in any observational study like this one, the authors wrote, so further analysis of ecosystems around the world is required.

Study: Climate change possible cause of bird species decline,"Climate change could be to blame for the collapse of bird populations in the desert along the Nevada-California border, scientists said. The number of bird species has fallen by an average of 43 percent over the past century at survey sites across an area larger than New York state, according to a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. The study shows almost a third of species are less common and widespread now than they once were throughout the region. The study's authors, Steven Beissinger and Kelly Iknayan, point to less hospitable conditions in the Mojave Desert as the probable cause. ""California deserts have already experienced quite a bit of drying and warming because of climate change, and this might be enough to push birds over the edge,"" said Iknayan, who conducted the research for her doctoral thesis at UC Berkeley. ""It seems like we are losing part of the desert ecosystem."" ""The Mojave Desert is now nearly half empty of birds,"" said Beissinger, a UC Berkeley professor of environmental science, policy and management. ""This appears to be a new baseline, and we don't know if it's stable or if it will continue to decline."" The researchers spent three years searching for birds at 61 locations on both sides of the border, including survey sites in the Spring Mountains and at Desert National Wildlife Refuge, just outside of Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported . They also surveyed sites across Death Valley and Joshua Tree national parks and Mojave National Preserve, Iknayan revisited the same sites UC Berkeley biologist Joseph Grinnell and his colleagues surveyed between 1908 and 1947. Iknayan and Beissinger found that areas with reduced rainfall lost more birds species than sites that remained wetter. Their findings were published earlier this month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers are calling it a collapse because it has occurred across the entire desert bird community. ""Studies elsewhere have found that climate change typically makes places unfavorable for some birds but opens the door for others to come in,"" Iknayan said. ""In the desert, we are not seeing increases in any of our species except for the common raven. There are a lack of climate change winners in the system."" ___ Information from: Las Vegas Review-Journal, http://www.lvrj.com",19/08/2018,https://www.foxnews.com/us/study-climate-change-possible-cause-of-bird-species-decline
"Climate change killed off Neanderthals, study says","Homo sapiens' closest relatives, the Neanderthals, died off approximately 40,000 years ago, but the exact cause is still up for debate. Now, a new study suggests that climate change was a bigger part in their extinction than previously believed. The evidence is there that Europe experienced stark cold and dry spells, putting a strain on Neanderthals' food supply and ability to survive. Thanks to a group of researchers looking at stalagmites in Romania, we may have proof this was indeed the case. For many years we have wondered what could have caused their demise,"" said Dr. Vasile Erse, a co-author of the study and a senior lecturer at Northumbria University, in a statement. ""Were they pushed over the edge by the arrival of modern humans, or were other factors involved? Our study suggests that climate change may have had an important role in the Neanderthal extinction. MYSTERIOUS LOST MAYA CITIES DISCOVERED IN GUATEMALAN JUNGLE Dr. Ersek and his team looked at the stalagmitesrocks that gather in caves for long stretches of time to look at the climate. Stalagmites contain rings, similar to trees, which can give an indication of how extreme weather patterns, occurring over thousands of years, impacted Neanderthals. The study was published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences. Neanderthals existed on Eurasia for approximately 350,000 years. But during the time of the last Ice Age and the arrival of modern humans in Europe, they became extinct. During cold periods of time, the team found a ""near complete absence"" of archaeological artifacts from the group, suggesting cooler temperatures meant fewer tools. Though Neanderthals had learned to control and manipulate fire, just like modern humans, Neanderthals did not incorporate fish and plants into their diet, giving them fewer food sources. As temperatures became colder and these animals naturally became more scarce during the freezing temperatures, Neanderthals became more susceptible to climate change. GRUESOME HUMAN SACRIFICE DISCOVERY: SKULLS REVEAL GRISLY SECRETS OF LOST AZTEC CITY Before now, we did not have climate records from the region where Neanderthals lived which had the necessary age accuracy and resolution to establish a link between when Neanderthals died out and the timing of these extreme cold periods, Dr. Ersek added. But our findings indicate that the Neanderthal populations successively decreased during the repeated cold stadials."" A stadial is a period of colder climate; conversely, an interstadial is a period of warmer climate. When temperatures started to warm up again, Neanderthals were left with a doomed fate, according to Dr. Ersek.

Jurassic-era monster predators flourished during extreme climate change 150M years ago,"A new study of fossilized teeth reveals that monster Jurassic-Era predators thrived in deep water more than 150 million years ago. The study, from paleontologists at Edinburgh University, also shows that species that lived in shallow waters eventually died out. ""Teeth are humble fossils, but they reveal a grand story of how sea reptiles evolved over millions of years as their environments changed,"" said Dr. Steve Brusatte, School of GeoSciences, in a press release. SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE UNCOVERED WHAT DINOSAUR DNA LOOKS LIKE Dr. Brusatte continued: ""Changes in these Jurassic reptiles parallel changes in dolphins and other marine species that are occurring today as sea-levels rise, which speaks to how important fossils are for understanding our modern world. The study, published in the Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution journal, analyzed the size and shape of reptiles living in tropical waters over an 18 million-year period, in what is now modern day northern France and the northern part of England. ""Groups did not significantly overlap in guild space, indicating that dietary niche partitioning enabled many species to live together,"" the study's abstract reads. ""Although a highly diverse fauna was present throughout the history of the seaway, fish and squid eaters with piercing teeth declined over time while hard-object and large-prey specialists diversified, in concert with rising sea levels."" Smaller species used thin, piercing teeth to catch fish, while larger species had broader teeth.

Thousands march in France to say 'no' to climate change,"More than 18,000 people marched Saturday in Paris as part of an international mobilization to show popular support for urgent measures to combat climate change in advance of a San Francisco summit. Crowds overflowed a plaza in front of City Hall before marching east to the Place de la Republique, carrying an urgent message that it's up to the public to put global warming at the top of the political agenda. ""Planet in Danger,"" read some banners. Activists around the world encouraged ""Rise for Climate"" protests before the summit taking place Sept.12-Sept. 14. California's governor proposed the event after President Donald Trump vowed to pull the U.S. out of a landmark 2015 climate accord. The international agreement was negotiated in France, and the French capital's march was more successful than ones held Saturday in other French cities or elsewhere in Europe. Police estimated that 18,500 took part in the Paris march, while organizers put the number at some 50,000. Several hundred people gathered in France's southern port city of Marseille. Several dozen called for an end to the use of fossil fuels outside London's Tate Modern art gallery. Only about two dozen showed up in Barcelona, Spain. The front-page of France's daily Liberation newspaper featured a call from 700 French scientists for the government to ""move from incantations to acts to move toward a carbon-free society."" The language was a reference to French President Emmanuel Macron's use of the phrase ""Make our planet great again,"" a takeoff on Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan. The signing scientists also called for ""strong and clear political choices"" and said ""solutions are available."" The march in Paris, organized with the theme ""Change the system, but don't change the climate,"" was both festive and serious. One protester, Manuel Bibes, denounced the plastic that inundates daily life. Another, Rodgrigo de la Vega criticized the practice of driving down the road to buy bread.

UN chief: World must prevent runaway climate change by 2020,"Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Monday that the world is facing ""a direct existential threat"" and must rapidly shift from dependence on fossil fuels by 2020 to prevent ""runaway climate change."" The U.N. chief called the crisis urgent and decried the lack of global leadership to address global warming. ""Climate change is moving faster than we are,"" Guterres said. ""We need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action."" He said people everywhere are experiencing record-breaking temperatures  and extreme heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods ""are leaving a trail of death and devastation."" As examples, Guterres pointed to Kerala, India's worst monsoon flooding in recent history, almost 3,000 deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, disappearing Arctic sea ice, some wildfires so big that they send ash around the world, oceans becoming more acidic threatening food chains, and high carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere threatening food security for billions of people. Guterres said scientists have been warning about global warming for decades, but ""far too many leaders have refused to listen  far too few have acted with the vision the science demands."" When some 190 nations signed the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change they agreed to limit the global temperature increase by 2100 to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. ""These targets were the bare minimum to avoid the worst impacts of climate change,"" Guterres said. ""But scientists tell us that we are far off track."" ""According to a U.N. study, the commitments made so far by parties to the Paris agreement represent just one-third of what is needed,"" the secretary-general said. Guterres said the mountain that needs to be climbed is very high  but not insurmountable. ""We need to rapidly shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels,"" he said. ""We need to replace them with clean energy from water, wind and sun. We must halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and change the way we farm."" He appealed for leadership  ""from politicians and leaders, from business and scientists, and from the public everywhere""  to break what he called the current ""paralysis"" and act now. ""If we do not change course by 2020, we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change, with disastrous consequences for people and all the natural systems that sustain us,"" Guterres warned. The alternative to moving to green energy, he said, ""is a dark and dangerous future."" Guterres said that when he addresses world leaders at their annual General Assembly gathering in two weeks, he will tell them ""that climate change is the great challenge of our time"" and what is missing is leadership and a sense of urgency to respond. He said an international meeting in Bangkok that ended Sunday made some progress on negotiations to help reach an agreement in December in Poland on guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris accord  ""but far from enough."" ""Nothing less than our future and the fate of humankind depends on how we rise to the climate challenge,"" Guterres said. ""Keeping our planet's warming to well below 2 degrees (Celsius) is essential for global prosperity, people's well-being and the security of nations."" He said that is why he will convoke a climate summit for world leaders in September 2019 ""to bring climate action to the top of the international agenda."" Guterres said technology is on the side of those seeking to tackle climate change. He cited the rising use of renewable energy, saying ""today, it is competitive with  and even cheaper  than coal and oil, especially if one factors in the cost of pollution."" And he singled out innovative programs in China, Sweden, Morocco, Scotland and Thailand. Guterres also pointed to other signs of hope including oil-rich Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy and oil-rich Norway's sovereign wealth fund  the largest in the world  moving away from investments in coal as well as in palm and pulp paper companies because of the forests they destroy.",10/09/2018,https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-chief-world-must-prevent-runaway-climate-change-by-2020
Scientists: World's warming; expect more intense hurricanes,"A warmer world makes for nastier hurricanes. Scientists say they are wetter, possess more energy and intensify faster. Their storm surges are more destructive because climate change has already made the seas rise. And lately, the storms seem to be stalling more often and thus dumping more rain. Study after study shows that climate change in general makes hurricanes worse. But determining the role of global warming in a specific storm such as Hurricane Florence or Typhoon Mangkhut is not so simple  at least not without detailed statistical and computer analyses. The Associated Press consulted with 17 meteorologists and scientists who study climate change, hurricanes or both. A few experts remain cautious about attributing global warming to a single event, but most of the scientists clearly see the hand of humans in Florence. Global warming didn't cause Florence, they say. But it makes the system a bigger danger. ""Florence is yet another poster child for the human-supercharged storms that are becoming more common and destructive as the planet warms,"" said Jonathan Overpeck, dean of the environment school at University of Michigan. He said the risk extends beyond the Atlantic Ocean, such as Typhoon Mangkhut, which hit the Philippines on Friday. For years, when asked about climate change and specific weather events, scientists would refrain from drawing clear connections. But over the past few years, the new field of attribution studies has allowed researchers to use statistics and computer models to try to calculate how events would be different in a world without human-caused climate change. A couple of months after Hurricane Harvey, studies found that global warming significantly increased the odds for Harvey's record heavy rains. ""It's a bit like a plot line out of 'Back to the Future,' where you travel back in time to some alternate reality"" that is plausible but without humans changing the climate, said University of Exeter climate scientist Peter Stott, one of the pioneers of the field. A National Academy of Sciences report finds these studies generally credible. One team of scientists tried to do a similar analysis for Florence, but outside experts were wary because it was based on forecasts, not observations, and did not use enough computer simulations. As the world warms and science advances, scientists get more specific, even without attribution studies. They cite basic physics, the most recent research about storms and past studies and put them together for something like Florence. ""I think we can say that the storm is stronger, wetter and more impactful from a coastal flooding standpoint than it would have been BECAUSE of human-caused warming,"" Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann wrote in an email. ""And we don't need an attribution study to tell us that in my view. We just need the laws of thermodynamics."" Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb looks not just at basic physics but all the peer-reviewed studies that especially link climate change to wetter storms. ""We have solid data across decades of rainfall records to nail the attribution  climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme rainfall events,"" Cobb said. Several factors make scientists more confident in pointing the climate-change finger at Florence. For every degree the air warms, it can hold nearly 4 percent more water (7 percent per degree Celsius) and offer measurably more energy to goose the storm, scientists said. ""The amount of water that comes out of hurricanes is certainly the most robust connection that we have,"" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist Jim Kossin said. And to look at Florence specifically, ""it's very likely that climate change has warmed the ocean such that the hurricane's intense rainfall is more destructive than without global warming,"" said Weather Underground Meteorology Director Jeff Masters, a former hurricane hunter. The warmer air and water also makes storms more intense or stronger, Stott said. A Kossin study this year showed that tropical cyclones  a category that includes hurricanes and typhoons  are moving slower and even stalling. Kossin said ""it's happening a lot more than it used to."" Several studies agree that climate change is to blame but differ slightly in their conclusions. With the emergence of Florence, some place in the U.S. has been drenched because of a stalled hurricane for four years in a row, storm surge expert Hal Needham said. Kossin and Overpeck also pointed to studies that show storms are intensifying more rapidly than they used to. Just like in Superstorm Sandy, scientists said it is clear that hurricane storm surge is worsened by sea level rise because the power of 6 to 10 feet of water comes on top of seas that were considerably lower decades ago. An extra 8 inches or so can mean the difference between staying dry or getting damaged, Masters said. In the Carolinas, natural and temporary climate factors added to the ""march upwards"" from global warning. Because of that, the seas have risen nearly 5 inches in five years, said Andrea Dutton of the University of Florida. Meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com cautioned that observers should ""stick to overall trends around the world and not individual cases."" University of Miami hurricane expert Brian McNoldy said there are too many ever-changing factors that make it hard to blame climate change specifically. ""If you are trying to make climate policy,"" Maue said Friday, ""you don't want to make it on a storm-by-storm basis."" ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

Small islands use big platform to warn of climate change,"On the map, their homes are tiny specks in a vast sea of blue, rarely in the headlines and far removed from the centers of power. But for a few days each year, the leaders of small island nations share a podium with presidents and prime ministers from the world's most powerful nations, and their message is clear: Global warming is already changing our lives, and it will change yours too. Speaking shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump  whose fiery speech made no mention of climate change  Danny Faure told the U.N. General Assembly this week that for his country, the Seychelles, it's already a daily reality. ""We see its effects in our eroding coastlines and unpredictable weather patterns,"" he said. ""We see its effects on our coral reefs and rising sea levels."" The Indian Ocean nation off the east coast of Africa is one of dozens of Small Island Developing States  or SIDS for short  that have been trying to draw attention to what they see as the overarching threat of our time. ""Decades ago, small island developing states warned the world of the risks of climate change, and those were once theoretical threats,"" said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands a sprawling series of atolls in the Pacific Ocean thousands of miles north of Australia. The message may finally be getting through, in part due to the devastating wildfires, storms and floods that have affected millions of people in the developed world over the past months. ""The extreme weather events lately have underscored to leaders elsewhere that this will affect their populations, too, in the here and now,"" said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, who has followed international climate negotiations for many years. The realization may help push leaders to commit to greater action to rein in climate change ahead of a year-end deadline that countries have set themselves to flesh out the 2015 Paris climate accord, Meyer said. But he warned that there remains a big gap between the rhetoric on climate change, and the willingness of leaders of major economies like Germany or Japan to take decisive actions, such as stop burning fossil fuels. Despite its minuscule carbon emissions, Heine said her nation wants to show it, too, is prepared to do its part. The country is aiming to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, a goal most climate experts consider an absolute deadline if the world is to avert runaway warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. Marshall Islanders know the future of their country, much of which is little over a meter (3.3 feet) above sea level, hangs in the balance. A recent report predicted that the world's oceans will rise by an average of at least 2 feet (61 centimeters) by the end of the century compared to now. Experts say the actions of the United States, which Trump announced will pull out of the Paris agreement, could play a decisive role in the future of small islands. Some officials warn that islanders may have to abandon their homes long before they sink beneath the waves, as the cost of rebuilding after every storm surge becomes too great. ""Last year, the passage of the storms Olga and Maria meant for our country the destruction of infrastructure built for a billion dollars,"" said Danilo Medina, president of the Dominican Republic. ""Imagine what that means for a country in which the annual budget of the state is already limited."" Medina said his Caribbean country backs calls for an international fund to compensate poor nations for the loss and damage caused by climate change. ""This fund will help protect the valuable lives of millions of human beings, bring peace of mind to their homes, allow them to have a future without the permanent uncertainty of feeling threatened every time they see the rain coming."" His words were echoed Thursday by Haiti's President Jovenel Moise, who urged rich countries to stick to their pledges under the Paris accord, which includes include financial aid for vulnerable nations to adapt to and mitigate the impact of climate change. New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, told a meeting of government and business leaders in New York this week of a recent visit to her country's Pacific neighbors of Samoa, Tonga, Niue and the Cook Islands. ""Cyclones are not new to the region, but the scale and devastation of them in recent times is new,"" she said. Ardern said she saw village children in Tonga having to cross roads now regularly flooded on their way to school, and saltwater seeping into underground aquifers, destroying the islands' few freshwater supplies. ""There is a grinding reality in hearing someone from a Pacific island talk about where the sea was when they were a child, and potential loss of their entire village as an adult,"" Ardern told the General Assembly on Thursday. Faure, the president of Seychelles, insisted that he's not asking to shut down the global economy, with its global travel and trade. ""But we need to remain aware of its consequences on our planet and our future. Through our neglect, we risk our children inheriting a planet beyond their capacity to repair,"" said Faure. ___ Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter",27/09/2018,https://www.foxnews.com/world/small-islands-use-big-platform-to-warn-of-climate-change
Terrifying climate change warning: 12 years until we??e doomed,"Earth is on track to face devastating consequences of climate change  extreme drought, food shortages and deadly flooding  unless theres an unprecedented effort made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, a new United Nations report warns. The planets surface has already warmed by 1 degree Celsius  or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit  and could see a catastrophic 1.5 C  2.7 F  increase between 2030 and 2052, scientists say. This is concerning because we know there are so many more problems if we exceed 1.5 degrees C global warming, including more heat waves and hot summers, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes, Andrew King, a climate science academic at the University of Melbourne, said in a statement to CNN. The stunning statistics were released Monday in a report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which warned that we must take rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society in order to save our planet. Scientists with the Nobel Prize-winning IPCC said in order to have even a 50-50 chance of staying under the 1.5 degree cap, the world must become carbon neutral by 2050. Any additional carbon dioxide emissions would require removing the harmful gas from the air. If nothing is done, Earth can expect heat wave temperatures to rise by 3 degrees Celsius, more frequent or extreme droughts, an increase in deadly hurricanes and as much as 90 percent of coral reefs dying off  including the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, according to the report. Countries in the southern hemisphere would see the most drastic effects. The next few years are probably the most important in human history, IPCC co-chair Debra Roberts, head of the Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department in South Africa, told Agence France-Presse. Efforts to curb climate change must also extend beyond the 2015 Paris Agreement reached among 197 countries  which President Trump withdrew the US from in June 2017. The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal, said King. Staying within the 1.5 degrees C target, instead of 2 degrees C, would result in the global sea level rising 3.9 inches less by 2100, reducing flooding. It would also cut down on species loss and extinction and reduce the impact on various ecosystems. There were doubts if we would be able to differentiate impacts set at 1.5 C and that came so clearly. Even the scientists were surprised to see how much science was already there and how much they could really differentiate and how great are the benefits of limiting global warming at 1.5 compared to 2, Thelma Krug, vice-chair of the IPCC, told Reuters. And now more than ever we know that every bit of warming matters.

Trump hedges on climate change denial in wake of Hurricane Michael; says 'there is something there',"President Trump on Monday once again backed off his previous claim that climate change is a hoax, but would not say whether or not he believed it was a man-made problem. Speaking at a Red Cross center in Georgia, where he was touring areas devastated by last weeks Hurricane Michael, Trump said there is something there in response to a question on climate change from a reporter. There is something there, man-made or not, the president said, before deflecting to note that there have been previous storms that were much more intense and destructive than the recent slew of hurricanes to hit the Southeast. Trumps comments come a day after CBS aired an interview on 60 Minutes with the president who said he doesn't want to put the U.S. at a disadvantage in responding to climate change. ""I think something's happening. Something's changing and it'll change back again,"" he said. ""I don't think it's a hoax. I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's man-made. I will say this: I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs."" Trump called climate change a hoax in November 2012 when he sent a tweet stating, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."" He later said he was joking about the Chinese connection, but in years since has continued to call global warming a hoax. ""I'm not denying climate change,"" he said in the interview. ""But it could very well go back. You know, we're talking about over a ... millions of years."" As far as the climate ""changing back,"" temperature records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that the world hasn't had a cooler-than-average year since 1976 or a cooler-than-normal month since the end of 1985. Trump's comments came just days after a Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a warning that global warming would increase climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth. The report detailed how Earth's weather, health and ecosystems would be in better shape if the world's leaders could somehow limit future human-caused warming. On Monday, the president said that he had heard of the recent report and that hell have to take a look at it. Trump added: I want crystal clear water, I want the cleanest air on the planet. Citing concerns about the pact's economic impact, Trump said in 2017 that the U.S. will leave the Paris climate accord. The agreement set voluntary greenhouse gas emission targets in an effort to lessen the impact of fossil fuels. Im truly an environmentalist, he said on Monday in regards to leaving the Paris Agreement. But that doesnt mean we have to put one of our businesses out of business.

"Black Death and other ancient diseases could be re-awakened by climate change, professor warns","Global warming could re-awaken ancient diseases and even the Black Death, according to an Oxford University professor. Higher global temperatures would melt ice sheets that store long-buried bacteria, which could spread disease and potentially cause new global pandemics. Professor Peter Frankopan offered his speculative prediction at the Cheltenham Literary Festival on Friday, as reported by The Times. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM THE SUN The professor of global history began by stating his view that there was ""absolutely no chance"" the international community would hit the Paris Agreement's target of keeping global temperature rises under 1.5C. He said, ""If we go over that degree change, its not about the Maldives being harder to visit on holiday or migration of people  its about what happens when permafrost unfreezes and the release of biological agents that have been buried for millennia."" And because ancient bacteria would be released again into the Earth's ecosystems, there would be a big risk of the global population being hit by diseases it can't handle. Chief amongst such diseases is the plague, which Frankopan states was spread in the Middle Ages largely due to a rise in global temperatures. ""For example, in the 1340s, a 1.5-degree movement of heating of the earths atmosphere  probably because of solar flares or volcanic activity  changes the cycle of Yersinia pestis bacterium,"" he explained. ""That one and a half degree difference allowed a small microbe to develop into the Black Death."" According to Frankopan, such a possibility should be taken more seriously than a rise in sea levels or droughts, not least because the Black Death wiped out between 75 and 200 million people in Europe in the 14th Century. ""These are the things we should be hugely worried about,"" he said. While his warnings draw a worst-case scenario for future global warming, there are recent examples of melting permafrost presenting a serious hazard to people. In 2016, a 12-year-old boy died and over 40 people were hospitalized in Siberia, after having been infected by anthrax. The anthrax had been released when high summer temperatures melted permafrost, which had kept a deer buried for decades following a previous outbreak of the dangerous bacteria. Since this deer had been killed by anthrax, its exposure caused the previously frozen bacteria to be released into the area's water and soil, where it then entered the food chain. Over 1,500 reindeer were infected and killed as a result, and since some of these had been eaten by local residents, they too were infected. Frankopan's predictions also come amid a growing slew of studies examining some of the more indirect effects of global warming. Yesterday, an international team of climate scientists publishing in the Nature Plants journal wrote that severe climate change would cause worldwide beer shortages. Last month, a paper published in the influential Nature journal concluded that global warming is already causing a rise in large landslides and tsunamis. While in July, researchers at Stanford University published research which found that rising global temperatures could result in 40,000 more suicides in the US and Mexico by 2050.

"Climate change could damage men's ability to procreate, study says","Sorry, honey  I can't tonight. Blame climate change. A new study highlights the risks that heatwaves can alter species' population numbers over time, resulting in drastically lower sperm counts for insects and could impact other groups for years to come. The findings were published in the journal Nature Communications. ""We know that biodiversity is suffering under climate change, but the specific causes and sensitivities are hard to pin down,"" said Research group leader Prof Matt Gage in a statement. ""We've shown in this work that sperm function is an especially sensitive trait when the environment heats up, and in a model system representing a huge amount of global biodiversity."" SCIENTIST: DECLINE IN FOREST INSECTS IS 'HYPERALARMING' Gage continued: ""Since sperm function is essential for reproduction and population viability, these findings could provide one explanation for why biodiversity is suffering under climate change. A warmer atmosphere will be more volatile and hazardous, with extreme events like heatwaves becoming increasingly frequent, intense and widespread."" The researchers looked at the red flour beetle to get the effects of simulated heatwaves on male reproduction. They were exposed to standard control conditions or a five-day heatwave where the temperatures ranged between 5C and 7C ""above their thermal optimum,"" the statement added. As a result, the researchers learned that the climate-controlled group had no problems reproducing, but those that were exposed to the harsher conditions suffered serious setbacks. The heatwaves ""halved"" the number of offspring produced and a second heatwave almost caused them to become sterile. ""Heatwaves are particularly damaging extreme weather events,"" Gage added in the statement. ""Local extinctions are known to occur when temperature changes become too intense. We wanted to know why this happens. And one answer could be related to sperm."" After the rise in temperatures, sperm count fell by three-quarters and ""any sperm produced then struggled to migrate into the female tract and were more likely to die before fertilization,"" according to the statement. Females, however, were not affected by the warmer conditions. ""Our research shows that heatwaves halve male reproductive fitness, and it was surprising how consistent the effect was,"" said Kirs Sales, a postgraduate researcher who led the research. While concerning in the short-term, there are significant longer-term implications as well, with Sales citing  ""the impacts of heatwaves on future generations."" THIS COFFIN-SHAPED ICEBERG IS HEADED TO DIE ""When males were exposed to two heatwave events 10 days apart, their offspring production was less than 1 percent of the control group,"" Sales said. ""Insects in nature are likely to experience multiple heatwave events, which could become a problem for population productivity if male reproduction cannot adapt or recover."" Of the offspring that did survive, they lived a shorter life-span, up to a few months shorter, the researcher found. There were also problems with male offspring, as some were found to be less fertile as a result of their fathers' exposure to the heatwave-like conditions. Beetles are believed to represent a quarter of biodiversity, Sales added, making these results concerning for how other species will react to climate change. ""Research has also shown that heat shock can damage male reproduction in warm-blooded animals too, and past work has shown that this leads to infertility in mammals,"" Sales added.

Error in major climate study revealed ??warming NOT higher than expected,"A major new climate study in the journal Nature got worldwide media coverage for finding that the oceans warmed dramatically faster than previously thought  but now the researchers have retracted that conclusion after a man in the United Kingdom blogged about flaws he discovered in the paper. Just two weeks after publication, the study authors have revised their paper, and now conclude that the oceans are warming fast -- but at the same rate as other measurements have found. A study co-author took responsibility for the error. I accept responsibility for these oversights because it was my role to ensure that details of the measurements were correctly understood and taken up by coauthors, study co-author Ralph Keeling wrote in an explanation of the revision. CATASTROPHIC GLOBAL WARMING LESS LIKELY, STUDY SAYS The error was first discovered by Nic Lewis, a retired British man who holds a bachelors degree in math from the University of Cambridge and who reads science papers for fun. He has also written a couple of published papers of his own on climate science. I've always liked to understand the world and to check whether people's research makes sense to me. Once I find something that seems wrong to me, I like to get to the bottom of it, Lewis told Fox News. Lewis said the incident should serve as a cautionary tale. AL GORE WOULD HAVE LOST GLOBAL WARMING BET, ACADEMIC SAYS I think it shows that the fact that a study is peer-reviewed and published by a premier journal gives very little assurance that its findings are valid, Lewis said. I was slightly surprised that neither the peer reviewers nor the editor had spotted what seemed to me an obvious red flag on page 1 of the paper, he added. Lewis said that the reviewers who approved that paper may have looked less closely for errors because the conclusion agreed with the typical belief that global warming is an extreme crisis. 'ARBITRARY' ADJUSTMENTS EXAGGERATE SEA LEVEL RISE, STUDY FINDS But all involved, including Lewis, agree that manmade greenhouse gas emissions are warming the oceans. People shouldn't be left with the impression that the errors in this paper put into doubt whether the ocean interior is warming. It clearly is wholly or mainly due to human greenhouse gas emissions, Lewis said. The study co-author who took responsibility for the error also made that point. TERRIFYING CLIMATE CHANGE WARNING: 12 YEARS UNTIL WERE DOOMED The evidence for ocean warming continues to be supported by millions of temperature readings throughout the oceans made by the international Argo network of sensors, Keeling told Fox News. The Argo network of sensors consists of nearly 4,000 floats around the world that observe the ocean. The study done by Keeling and his coauthors attempted to estimate ocean temperatures a totally different way -- by using measurements of atmospheric oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) ... which increase as the ocean warms and releases gases. Keeling said that such a study still had some value. GLOBAL WARMING WILL RUIN BEER, SCIENTISTS WARN Our study still also provides independent evidence that the ocean is warming. We accept that our method doesnt determine the amount of warming as precisely as we previously thought, Keeling added. Keeling also acknowledged Lewis for pointing out the error. The scientific process is self-correcting when errors are made or new evidence is discovered. Hats off to Nic Lewis for his role here, Keeling said. WORLD'S LARGEST SHIPPING COMPANY HEADS TO ARCTIC AS CLIMATE CHANGE MAY OPEN UP NEW ROUTES While the Earth has warmed  government data show that the planet is nearly 2F warmer than in the 1970s  researchers like Lewis make the case that climate models are not that great and may overpredict warming. Climate science suffers from being politicized, Lewis told Fox News. Its too infected by the idea of consensus and models... warming is likely to be less severe than global climate models say.

"Climate report warns of grim economic consequences, worsening weather disasters in US","The White House on Friday released a federal report that found that the impacts of climate change are being felt across the country, and extreme weather and climate-related events are going to worsen in the years to come -- with a significant impact on the economy. The National Climate Assessment finds that extreme weather disasters ""have already become more frequent, intense, widespread or of long duration and have cost the the U.S. nearly $400 billion since 2015. The report is mandated every four years and is based on previous research. Its aim is to detail how climate change is affecting the U.S. and how it is impacting the economy. It is written by outside scientists and officials from 13 federal agencies. Without more significant global greenhouse gas mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause substantial losses to infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century, the report says, arguing that sectors that require national resources and favorable climates -- such as agriculture, tourism and fishing, are particularly vulnerable. The report also finds that the U.S. will be 3-12 degrees hotter by the end of the century, depending on how much greenhouse gas is released into the atmosphere. It also says that more than 90 percent of current warming is caused by humans. It is unclear how the report will be greeted by the Trump administration, and particularly the White House. President Trump has been vocal in his skepticism about man-made climate change and the effects it is allegedly having both on temperatures and extreme weather events. He also pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. Trump seemed to take a knock at those calling for action over climate change this week, when he noted that a cold blast was set to hit the U.S. Whatever happened to Global Warming? he asked. The report was initially set to be released in December. The White Houses decision to instead release the report on Black Friday was likely to lead to accusations that the administration was attempting to dump the report on a day many Americans were not engaged in the news cycle. Study co-author Andrew Light, an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute, told The Associated Press that the release  ""is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying but suppressing the best of climate science. Al Gore, the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee and climate activist, accused President Trump of attempting to ""hide the truth."" However, David Reidmiller, the director of the assessment, said the timing was in order to have the report come out ahead of U.N. climate talks, which begin in Poland on December 2, according to Axios. The report comes just as California has been tackling devastating wildfires that have killed at least 84 people. President Trump has said that better forest management could have helped limit the blaze. This week Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed radical environmentalists for making the fires worse, saying that a complicating matter was ""lawsuit after lawsuit by, yes, the radical environmental groups that would rather burn down the entire forest than cut a single tree or thin the forest. But the report issued Friday said that warmer and drier conditions have contributed to an increase in large forest fires in the western United States and interior Alaska.",23/11/2018,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-report-warns-of-grim-economic-consequences-more-weather-disasters-in-us
Al Gore blasts Trump for 'burying' climate report by releasing it on Black Friday,"Former Vice President Al Gore accused the Trump administration of trying to bury a damning government report that linked global warming to the worsening of natural disasters by quietly releasing the study on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Gore, who since his time as vice president has become an outspoken advocate for the need to counteract the effects of global warming, said in a statement that the White House was trying to bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving. The day, known as Black Friday, has become the traditional start of the holiday shopping season and one that most Americans have off from work. Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the West, hurricanes batter our coasts  and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis, Gore said in a statement that he posted on Twitter Friday. The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible. The National Climate Assessment, which is mandated by law every few years and is based on more than 1,000 previous research studies, details how global warming -- from the burning of coal, oil and gas -- is hurting each region of the United States and how it impacts different sectors of the economy, including energy and agriculture. It was written long before the deadly fires in California this month and before Hurricanes Florence and Michael raked the East Coast and Florida. ""Climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life, the economy, and the natural systems that support us,"" the report says. This includes worsening air pollution causing heart and lung problems, more diseases from insects, the potential for a jump in deaths during heat waves, and nastier allergies, according to the report. Annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century  more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states,"" the report says. It'll be especially costly on the nation's coasts because of rising seas and severe storm surges, which will lower property values. And in some areas, such as parts of Alaska and Louisiana, coastal flooding will likely force people to relocate. While Gore has become one of the most prominent advocates for reducing carbon emissions and fighting to reduce the effect of climate change, the former vice president has not been immune from claims that his work is not as altruistic as it appears. Gore left the vice presidents residence with a relatively modest net worth of $1.7 million -- mostly from family farm assets -- but since the release of his 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth and his continuing global tour to preach his message, he has amassed a fortune valued at upward of $200 million. From the fossil fuels he burns jetting around the globe, to his socializing with Hollywood heavy hitters, to his 6,500-square-foot seafront home in California that cost $8.8 million, some climate activists have questioned whether Gore is helping or hurting the climate fight. He is a flawed character, Stephen Lacey, editor-in-chief of the magazine GreenTechMedia, said on his podcast The Energy Gang last year. Were in an era of backlash against elites, so Gore, a guy who bought a 6,500-square-foot seafront home in California for $8.8 million, and who hangs around with other celebrities who talk big on climate but who live lavish lifestyles, is the perfect target at this point in time. Gores lifestyle aside, his statement comes amid what appears to be a continuing denial from Trump and members of his administration about the dangers climate change poses to the environment and to the worlds economy. Earlier in the week, Trump tweeted about the brutal cold spell that hit the East Coast over the Thanksgiving holiday and questioned Whatever happened to Global Warming? Friday's report seemed to anticipate such comments, saying: ""Over shorter timescales and smaller geographic regions, the influence of natural variability can be larger than the influence of human activity ... Over climate timescales of multiple decades, however, global temperature continues to steadily increase."" The Lower 48 states have warmed 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) since 1900 with 1.2 degrees in the last few decades, according to the report. By the end of the century, the U.S. will be 3 to 12 degrees (1.6 to 6.6 degrees Celsius) hotter depending on how much greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, the report warns. Releasing the report on Black Friday ""is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying, but suppressing the best of climate science,"" said study co-author Andrew Light, an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute. During a press conference Friday, officials behind the report repeatedly declined to answer questions about the timing of its release and why it contradicts public statements from Trump. Report director David Reidmiller said questions about the timing were ""relevant,"" but said what was in the report was more important.

Can Venus teach us to take climate change seriously?,"If human-induced climate change continues unchecked, 10 percent of the U.S. economy could evaporate by 2100, a 1,656-page federal report the White House slipped out on Black Friday (Nov. 23) warned  but a nearby world has an even hotter climate problem than ours, and scientists say we could learn some valuable lessons from it. That world is Venus, Earth's ""evil twin,"" which was once nice enough  until something went wrong and the atmosphere began trapping a little too much heat. Scientists aren't positive precisely how events played out, but the runaway greenhouse effect that resulted is beyond debate: Venus now clocks in at a staggering 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius). ""I think Venus is an important warning: Greenhouse atmospheres are not theoretical,"" Ellen Stofan, director of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum and former chief scientist at NASA, told Space.com. And in fact, Venus has already warned us about a climate threat  Stofan said that it was studying our neighbor that prompted scientists to look for an ozone hole here on Earth. They found it, and in perhaps the only veritable climate success, international agreements have cut production of the compounds that eat away at ozone. [Japan at Venus: Photos from the Akatsuki Spacecraft's Mission] Much of the appeal of Venus comes from the fact that despite its horrifying modern appearance, it's actually really similar to Earth. ""Picture a planet that's just like Earth but it's a little hotter because it's a little closer to the sun  and that would be Venus,"" David Grinspoon, a planetary scientist and astrobiologist at the Planetary Science Institute, told Space.com. Along with Mars, these planets form a trio of worlds that began with comparable sizes, materials and temperatures  until suddenly, they were very different. Once upon a time, Venus, like Earth today, was covered in water, perhaps even habitable. Then, gradually, something fell out of whack. ""The basic mechanism is very simple: Everybody knows that if you heat up water you make steam,"" Grinspoon said. And water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas, trapping still more heat. ""There's nothing to really stop it until the oceans fully evaporate."" (Today, Venus' atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide; radiation from the sun likely broke up the water vapor, letting it escape into space.) The divergent paths of Earth and its two neighbors pose an existential dilemma more powerful even than anthropogenic climate change: Humans or no, Earth's cozy environment won't last forever, either. ""We think of habitability like, 'Oh, you have a habitable planet and it just stays that way,'"" Stofan said. ""Habitability can be very transient in a planet's history."" Of the three, Earth's habitability window has lasted the longest, and Venus' was probably shorter than Mars, but scientists aren't yet sure by just how much, she added. At a strictly intellectual level, data from Venus and Mars about how a planet and its atmosphere affect each other can be more intriguing than terrestrial data. ""For a geologist, Venus is such a great planet because you have geology and you have the atmosphere and they're interacting with each other in a really interesting way without the mess of the biosphere,"" Stofan said. ""It's kind of like a pure planet, which for a geologist is really fun."" But while Earth's biosphere may be intellectually annoying, we're all awfully fond of it, and that's a powerful reason to care about climates on other worlds. ""It's no longer just a luxury because we're curious,"" Grinspoon said. ""It's become an essential survival tool for us now."" Climate scientists are the first to tell you they want more data, more models, more to dig their teeth into. Some types of climate information does go back millennia, like the details trapped in columns of sediment that scientists can pull from the ocean floor, but climate data is skewed heavily toward modern years. [Amazing Venus Photos by ESA's Venus Express] So doubling the number of planets you're looking at  even with limited data  makes a difference. ""[Venus is] a laboratory for understanding climate physics and climate change on an Earth-like planet,"" Grinspoon said. ""You can't learn everything you need to know about climate change on Earth by only studying Earth."" And unlike climate here on Earth, the same interactions on Venus don't have the kind of emotional drama attached to them. That means that Venus doesn't just offer new information  it also offers a new way of talking about climate, even with those who have taken an ideological stand against findings here on Earth. ""I've had some conversations with people in that camp that have been fruitful because I've used the example of Venus,"" Grinspoon said. ""It allows you to sort of reframe the question  you're not just talking about policy choices on Earth. ... It's not a cure-all for that difficult conversation, but I do think it can help."" Whatever humans do or do not choose to do about Earth's climate, someday countless years from now, as the sun swells in its old age, our world will travel the same path as Venus, with the oceans evaporating away into a runaway greenhouse world. By then, climate won't be a problem for any of us, but it's still a poignant reminder of what science can tell us about the world. ""I'm not saying, 'Oh, that's about to happen to Earth,'"" Grinspoon said. ""But the overall lesson still stands that climate stability is not something you can take for granted.""

??ollapse of civilization??predicted at UN climate summit,"You're probably used to hearing Sir David Attenborough's sonorous, British voice describe the miracles of pufferfish courtship and blooming stink flowers in nature documentaries like ""Planet Earth"" and ""Blue Planet."" But today (Dec. 3), the naturalist and filmmaker delivered a far more somber monologue at the United Nations Climate Summit in Katowice, Poland. ""Right now, we're facing a man-made disaster of global scale,"" Attenborough told delegates from almost 200 nations. ""Our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change. If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon."" Attenborough was chosen to speak at the summit as part of the U.N.'s new ""people's seat"" initiative, which encouraged citizens of the world to share their personal messages and videos explaining how climate change has already affected their lives. Several of these messages were shared as part of Attenborough's speech today; they included footage of people standing in front of the ashen remains of their homes, which had been incinerated by wildfires. [6 Spectacular Species Named for David Attenborough] ""The world's people have spoken,"" Attenborough said. ""Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now."" This meeting of the U.N. was convened so that leaders of the world could negotiate ways to turn their pledges made at the 2015 Paris climate accord into a reality. Per the Paris accord, 184 countries agreed to implement emissions-reduction policies to help limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels over the next century. Most of the world's nations are not on track to meet this goal; in fact, a global temperature rise of 4 degrees C (7.2 degrees F) seems far more likely right now. According to a recent U.N. climate report, even limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) this century could result in serious consequences for the planet's cities and ecosystems. Those effects include increased flooding and severe weather around the world, the destruction of up to 90 percent of the ocean's coral reefs, mass animal extinctions, and food shortages brought on by regular droughts. A recent U.S. climate assessment, released quietly over Thanksgiving weekend by President Donald Trump's White House, affirmed these findings and the impending danger of climate change. ""Leaders of the world, you must lead,"" Attenborough concluded. ""The continuation of our civilizations and the natural world upon which we depend is in your hands.""

Researchers did the report to investigate whether the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2009 Endangerment Finding, which found that greenhouse gases pose a risk to human health, still held up. The new study showed that there is now even more evidence that greenhouse gases are harming human health and welfare. The investigation also found an additional four areas, not listed in the original report, in which greenhouse gases threaten people. ""There's absolutely no scientific basis for questioning the Endangerment Finding,"" review lead researcher Philip Duffy, president and executive director of the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts, told Live Science. ""The case for endangerment is stronger than ever."" [6 Unexpected Effects of Climate Change] What is the Endangerment Finding? The original Endangerment Finding was a long time in the making. It began when Massachusetts and other states sued the EPA during President George W. Bush's administration, asking the agency to regulate greenhouse gases. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that not only does the EPA have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, but it also can't refuse to do so if these pollutants are found to endanger people. ""The Supreme Court said 'if you determine that greenhouse gases are dangerous, then you have to regulate them,'"" Duffy said. ""But, of course, the Supreme Court wasn't itself going to say whether greenhouse gases are dangerous. That's a scientific process not a legal one. So, the EPA undertook the scientific assessment of the dangerousness or not-dangerousness of greenhouse gases."" In December 2009, the EPA released that report, which found that greenhouse gases do endanger human health and welfare by causing climate change. The administration of President Barack Obama used this finding to implement new regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan and stronger vehicle mileage standards for cars and light trucks, Duffy said. But now, people in and out of President Donald Trump's administration have discussed overturning or revisiting the endangerment finding, Duffy said. In response to these statements, Duffy and his colleagues decided to look at scientific studies published since the endangerment finding came out, to see whether the science strengthened or weakened the case for endangerment. What the science shows The new review grouped the findings into different categories: public health, air quality, agriculture, forests, water resources, sea level rise, infrastructure and wildlife. The four new categories include ocean acidification, national security, economic well-being and violence. Here are more in-depth looks at several of them. Overview of public health People in more than 200 U.S. cities have an increased risk of premature death because of future warming, the researchers found. Extreme heat is linked with sleep loss, kidney stones, low birth weight, violence and suicide. Exposure to ozone and other air pollutants, including smoke from forest fires, can be bad for human health. Extreme weather events intensified by climate change can lead to physical trauma, disease outbreaks, interruption of health care delivery and mental health problems. Rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels are also increasing the length of pollen season, which affects people with allergies. Certain crops are expected to produce fewer nutrients. Population displacement and armed conflict can also amplify risks to human health. [Photos Show Horrifying Scenes from California Wildfires] Water resources With less snowpack in the mountains, the West and Southwest may experience more droughts. Reduced snowpack can lead to reduced river flow, which can threaten rare and endangered species, such as salmon and wolverines. Climate change is also expected to erode water quality in the United States because of nutrient loading (such as from fertilizer or animal waste), especially in the Midwest and Northeast. Sea level rise High sea levels will increase the risk to coastal communities, economies and infrastructure, largely because of flooding, erosion and extreme events. These effects can lead to displacement through ""climate gentrification,"" in which people living at higher elevations have higher-priced properties. The movement of goods among major port cities will likely be affected, too, causing economic disruptions. Sea level rise may also disrupt the U.S. military, as well as disaster and humanitarian relief efforts. National security The United States' existing security will likely need to change as the planet warms. For example, in the Arctic, reduced sea ice will clear the way for more Chinese trade routes and Russian oil and gas extraction, possibly causing tensions between these countries and the U.S., the researchers wrote. Economic well-being An increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) over 75 years is expected to permanently reduce U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by about 3 percent. The U.S. GDP is expected to be about 4 percent greater if warming is limited to 2.7 degrees F (1.5 degrees C) than if it's 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) above pre-industrial levels. Economies in poorer countries are expected to have an economic burden from climate change that is about five times larger than that of wealthier counties, the researchers found. Violence and instability Rising temperatures and increased rainfall can amplify violence and instability. In the U.S., higher temperatures are associated with higher rates of domestic violence, rape, assault and murder. Warmer periods may also elevate the risk of self-harm, including suicide, emerging evidence suggests. Takeaway message These findings ""highlight this contrast between the science and the policies,"" Duffy said. ""The scientific evidence is going in one direction, and the policies are going in exactly the opposite direction."" But this report shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, said Jason Smerdon, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in New York, who wasn't involved with the review. ""If you've been paying attention, the Endangerment Finding in 2009 was very well-reasoned, and it's only gotten stronger since that time,"" Smerdon told Live Science. ""It's basically a tsunami of evidence in support of the fact. People have very clearly connected the changing climate, which we're causing, to the downstream impacts."" The review also drives home that climate change will affect everybody, not just people in distant lands. ""Reports like this all point out that every one of us will be impacted by climate change in different ways, and it's going to be in all of our backyards,"" Smerdon said. ""It's not something that's going to be far away."" The review was published online yesterday (Dec. 13) in the journal Science.

"Climate change is causing waves to get bigger and more powerful, study shows","Surf's up  but not in a good way. A new study theorizes that as climate change continues to disrupt the oceans around the world, waves are becoming stronger and more powerful. ""The upper-ocean warming, a consequence of anthropogenic global warming, is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger,"" the study's abstract, published in the scientific journal Nature, reads. ""This identifies wave power as a potentially valuable climate change indicator."" EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING ON OUR OCEANS EQUIVALENT TO A-BOMB EXPLOSION EVERY SECOND FOR 150 YEARS The study found that waves have increased in strength by 0.41 percent per year since 1948. It also found that there are ""long-term correlations"" with sea surface temperatures, in the most energetic region in the globe, defined as the tropical Atlantic, while adding that ""wave power in high south latitudes"" was also concerning. Borja Reguero, Inigo Losada and Fernando Mendez were the authors on the study. In a statement accompanying the study, Losada said that wave power is a good indicator of global warming. ""This study shows that the global wave power can be a potentially valuable indicator of global warming, similarly to carbon dioxide concentration, the global sea level rise, or the global surface atmospheric temperature,"" Losada said in the statement. The 0.41 percent increase is an average, with some other parts of the world experiencing significantly stronger waves, including the Southern Ocean. ""Our results show 2 [percent] increases per year in many regions of the Southern Ocean (Fig. 6, south of 40 degrees South), for an average 0.58 percent per year across the basin,"" the researchers wrote in the study. Understanding the impact of ocean waves is important because not only do they determine where people build infrastructure, such as ports, harbors or levees, but they also provide a level of intelligence where to put other types of coastal defenses. ANTARCTIC ICE IS MELTING SIX TIMES FASTER THAN IT DID IN THE 1980S AND COULD 'DESTABILIZE' GLACIERS Mendez said the effects of climate change are likely to be felt more at the coast than inland, citing the results of the study. Our results indicate that risk analysis neglecting the changes in wave power and having sea level rise as the only driver may underestimate the consequences of climate change and result in insufficient or maladaptation, he said. Earlier this month, a separate study shed light on how much energy that has been put into the Earth's oceans over the past 150 years  the equivalent of an atomic bomb explosion every second for 150 years.

"Here's the 1 way we can avoid climate catastrophe, scary report says","How can humans limit catastrophic climate change? We can phase out fossil-fuel emitters  such as coal-burning power plants, jet-fuel-slurping planes and gas-thirsty automobiles  once they reach their retirement age, a new study finds. And we need to start doing that now, the researchers said. If society actually did that, we'd have a 64 percent chance of limiting the average global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels, said study lead researcher Christopher Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science at the University of Leeds, in England. [6 Unexpected Effects of Climate Change] ""We could ramp down all of the fossil-fuel-emitting infrastructure that we have, all of the way until it reaches the end of its life,"" Smith told Live Science. ""And then we'd replace it with something [that emits] zero carbon."" However, this plan  while scientifically sound  is likely a pie-in-the-sky idea that won't happen anytime soon, said Donald Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who wasn't involved with the research. ""It's just not going to happen,"" Wuebbles told Live Science. ""It's so much cheaper to rehabilitate existing facilities than it is to totally close everything off."" On the upside, weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels will likely happen at some point, just not tomorrow, Wuebbles said. Generally, it takes about 40 to 50 years for society to change its major power sources, for instance from coal to nuclear power plants. ""I think this one [from fossil fuels to renewable energy] is going to occur somewhat more rapidly, but it's still going to be hard,"" Wuebbles said. Climate change calculation Smith's team chose the 2.7 degree F (1.5 degree C) benchmark because that's a temperature increase that could unleash extreme flooding on small island states, he said. ""The difference in the sea level rise of the rate of warming between 1.5 and 2 degrees [celsius] would literally be life or death for them,"" Smith said. And because climate change doesn't follow a linear trajectory (instead, it becomes much worse at high levels of warming), an increase of 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) could be catastrophic, Smith noted. That said, ""it is probably better to aim for [1.5 degrees C] and miss it slightly than it is for us to say 2 degrees is fine,"" Smith said. ""Because 1.6 [degrees C] is still a lot better than 2. I would definitely say we should have ambition and every fraction of a degree warming we can avoid is a good thing."" So, he and his colleagues got to work to see whether humans could stick to the 2.7 degree F (1.5 degrees C) benchmark if societies the world over phased out sources of fossil fuels and then replaced them with zero-carbon alternatives. It was possible, they found; if the plan was followed, carbon-dioxide emissions would become near zero after just 40 years. [The Reality of Climate Change: 10 Myths Busted] ""If we don't build any new fossil fuel infrastructure, there is a good chance we'll avoid the worst impacts of climate change,"" Smith said. There is hope on the horizon, too, he added. Even if some federal governments aren't taking action, some state governments and companies are. For instance, in December 2018, the shipping giant Maersk pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050. But humans have to act quickly, Smith noted. If governments and private industries wait until 2030 to start phasing out fossil-fuel emitters, there will only be a 50 percent chance that the world will be able to keep the average temperature increase to 2.7 degrees F, even if the rate of fossil-fuel retirement is accelerated, the researchers found. Meanwhile, the transition will likely happen, but a lot more slowly than the study plan calls for, Wuebbles said. ""The bottom line is, I agree with the concept of the paper, it's an interesting piece of work, he said. ""I just don't see the political systems responding, unfortunately."" The study also has two major caveats. First, it does not ""assess the practical feasibility of this transition,"" but rather focuses on the numbers, the researchers wrote in the study. That's a tall order, as phasing out fossil-fuel emitters will be an expensive and time-consuming mission, especially in industries that don't have good green energy alternatives yet, such as aviation. In addition, the study doesn't consider hard-to-predict climate-change contributors, such as permafrost melt or forest dieback, which were not included in their model, Smith said. But even if these events occur, limiting human-made greenhouse gases is still worthwhile, Smith said. The study was published online today (Jan. 15) in the journal Nature Communications.

"More than 250,000 people may die each year due to climate change","In the coming decades, more than a quarter-million people may die each year as a result of climate change, according to a new review study. In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that climate change would lead to about 250,000 additional deaths each year between 2030 and 2050, from factors such as malnutrition, heat stress and malaria. But the new review, published Jan. 17 in The New England Journal of Medicine, said this is a ""conservative estimate."" That's because it fails to take into account other climate-related factors that could affect death rates  such as population displacement and reductions in labor productivity from farmers due to increased heat, study co-author Dr. Andrew Haines, epidemiologist and former director of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, told CNN. In addition, the WHO estimate didn't take into account illnesses and deaths tied to disruptions in health services caused by extreme weather and climate events, the review said. The new review didn't give an updated estimate of climate-change-related deaths, but noted that reduced food production alone is predicted to lead to a net increase of 529,000 adult deaths by 2050, according to a 2016 study. Climate change could also force more than 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030, according to World Bank estimates, which in turn, would make them more vulnerable to the health effects of the changing climate. All of this underscores the need for investments and policies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and promote ways to mitigate the health effects of climate change, the report said. ""Climate change is causing injuries, illnesses and deaths, with the risks projected to increase substantially with additional climate change, threatening the health of many millions of people,"" the report said. ""The pervasive threats to health posed by climate change demand decisive actions from health professionals and governments to protect the health of current and future generations.""

"Ocasio-Cortez calls climate change ??ur World War II,??warns the world will end in 12 years","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., spoke out on Monday about the urgency to take on climate change, comparing it to World War II. Speaking at an event commemorating Martin Luther King Day, Ocasio-Cortez expressed how the issue of climate change is a generational issue that younger people are more focused on. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ SLAMS AARON SORKIN FOR TELLING NEW DEMS TO 'STOP ACTING LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE' Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and were like: The world is gonna end in 12 years if we dont address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'"" Ocasio-Cortez said. The Democratic Socialist said the fight against climate change is war and that its our World War II. While a steady stream of international reports have raised alarm about climate change, they stop markedly short of predicting the end of the world. A widely publicized study last fall by a United Nations panel said the world should take unprecedented actions to cut carbon emissions in the next decade  this, to avoid rising past 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels. UNIVERSITIES HELPING STEER LEFTWARD SHIFT IN POLITICS In November, the White House released another report that found the impacts of climate change are being felt across the country, and extreme weather and climate-related events are going to worsen in the years to come -- with a significant impact on the economy. The National Climate Assessment found that extreme weather disasters  have already become more frequent, intense, widespread or of long duration and have cost the U.S. nearly $400 billion since 2015.  Ocasio-Cortez has forged a reputation for making bold, at-times factually incomplete statements. She recently lashed out at fact-checkers, accusing those scrutinizing her statements of ""false equivalency"" and ""bias,"" before backing down on the criticism. Ocasio-Cortez has made waves ever since she won the upset victory in New York against incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, who was a top Democrat in Congress at the time.

Physicist: Don't fall for the argument about 'settled science',"I am dismayed to hear that NBCs Meet The Press is actually blaming science for its decision to shut down any intelligent, meaningful discussion about climate change. Were not going to give time to climate deniers, the shows host recently said, referring to people, including Nobel laureates, who disagree that humans are mostly to blame for altering Earths climate. The science is settled even if political opinion is not. For the record Im neither a denier or an alarmist. Im a physicist who does his very best to seek the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Im also a journalist whos been covering the complexities of the climate change story since the 1980s, even reporting directly from the north and south poles, where much of the climate research is done. My point here is not to debate the merits of todays resolute scientific consensus that humans are having a decisive, apocalyptic impact on the climate. It might very well be correct. WHY MARS MANIA WILL REACH AN ALL-TIME HIGH IN 2019 My point is that if you are absolutely, 100 percent convinced it is  as evidently the producers of the aforementioned news show are  you have a right to say your mind is settled, or your politics are settled. But never say the science of this or any equally complex subject is settled. That crucial lesson was learned centuries ago, when something far simpler than Earths mercurial climate was being hotly debated. Back then the scientific community was convinced beyond any doubt that our planet was at the center of the universe. In the sixteenth century, Nicolaus Copernicus  a geocentric denier, to use todays pejorative labeling  was derided for believing the sun was at the center of everything. Mainstream scientists and university professors of the day proclaimed the science was settled and justified their evidence-based derision of Copernicus by citing the mountain of observational data in favor of the geocentric consensus. Tragically, if NBC had been around, the good Mr. Copernicus would not have been allowed to argue his case on ""Meet The Press."" Ditto for that other notorious geocentric denier, Galileo Galilei. In the early seventeenth century even the Catholic Church  which had long since reconciled scripture with sciences earth-centered consensus  condemned Galileo for his wayward thinking. Declaring that both science and scripture were settled, Pope Urban VIIIs chief inquisitor sentenced the aged astronomer to house arrest  but only after shaming him into publicly recanting his denial of geocentricism. The list is long and sobering of examples in history where resolute scientific consensuses have been disproven. And, worse, disproven only after deniers had been crushed and even destroyed for touting nonconforming interpretations of available evidence. Altogether the lesson should be crystal clear: science  which I believe to be the most brilliant discipline we have for understanding the physical universe  is fallible and, therefore, always open to debate. The ""Meet The Press"" policy is pointedly and dangerously unscientific. And so are the calls by like-minded individuals to not just silence but punish anyone who dares to challenge the consensus of human-caused climate change  all allegedly in the name of science. I think that denying climate change is a crime against humanity, says comedian Eric Idle, not joking. And they should be held accountable in a World Court. Bill Nye  another commentator, but with an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering  agrees, saying, this extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen. So I can see where people are very concerned about this, and theyre pursuing criminal investigations ... The scientific consensus is in, and the argument is now over, proclaims actor Leonardo Di Caprio. If you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts, or in science or empirical truths and therefore, in my humble opinion, should not be allowed to hold public office. Albert Einstein once faced a similar kind of repulsive, benighted lynch mob. In his day, the scientific establishment resolutely believed that time and space were absolutes and cited as incontrovertible proof a vast literature of peer-reviewed, published studies. Collectively, mainstream scientists mocked Einsteins belief that space and time were relative  some calling it Jewish science, a particularly hateful way of smearing the young space-time denier.  Yet, as everyone now knows, Einstein  like Copernicus, Galileo, and scores of other vindicated deniers over the centuries  ultimately disproved the vaunted scientific consensus. By all means, vet your guests carefully  avoid the uncredentialed nut jobs and purely political partisans. But, above all, heed Einsteins wise words about how science really works. No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right, he observed, a single experiment can prove me wrong.

"Climate change could cause 'substantial increase' in extreme storms, NASA says","Climate change, which is the subject of fierce debate, may lead to a ""substantial increase"" in the number of extreme rainstorms, according to a startling new study by NASA. The study, published in the scientific journal, Geophysical Research Letters, looked at 15 years worth of data from the government agency's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument over tropical oceans and noticed that extreme storms tend to occur more frequently over warmer sea temperatures. For every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit rise in ocean temperatures, 21 percent more storms form, the researchers found. ""It is somewhat common sense that severe storms will increase in a warmer environment. Thunderstorms typically occur in the warmest season of the year,"" NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) researcher Hartmut Aumann, explained in a statement. ""But our data provide the first quantitative estimate of how much they are likely to increase, at least for the tropical oceans."" CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSING WAVES TO GET BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL, STUDY SHOWS Extreme storms are defined as those that produce at least 3 millimeters of rain per hour over a 16-mile area. By the end of the century, ocean surface temperatures may rise as much as 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit, assuming a steady increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, according to current climate models. Though the study notes climate models are not perfect, they do help to provide a guideline for those looking to prepare for the changes, such as lawmakers and citizens.

"Australian rodent marks first climate change extinction, scientists say","An Australian rodent that lived near the Great Barrier Reef has been officially declared extinct, making it the first known mammal killed off by climate change, according to researchers. The Bramble Cay melomys, a rat-like rodent known to live on a small northern island at the edge of the Torres Strait Islands in Queensland, was relocated from the government's ""endangered"" list to its ""extinct"" list, the Australian Department of the Environment and Energy announced Monday. ANTARCTIC 'TIME BOMB' WAITING TO GO OFF Researchers, in a 2016 report released on the critter, said they confirmed that melomys on Bramble Cay were extinct after a ""survey in March 2014 failed to detect the species."" Fishermen who visited the area suggested to scientists that the last known sighting of the animal was in late 2009. The main factor responsible in the mammal's extinction, ""was almost certainly ocean inundation of the low-lying cay, very likely on multiple occasions, during the last decade, causing dramatic habitat loss and perhaps also direct mortality of individuals,"" researchers said.  The ""fastest rates of sea level rise"" in Australia and near the Great Barrier Reef are in the north, where Bramble Cay is located, according to the government's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Officials said that because land around the reef is low-lying, ""small changes in sea level will mean greater erosion and land inundation."" The Torres Strait region where Bramble Cay is located has seen ""extreme high water levels and damaging storm surges,"" the 2016 report stated.

Hurricanes create natural climate change labs in Puerto Rico,"The hurricanes that pounded Puerto Rico in 2017, blasting away most of its forest cover, may give scientists clues to how the world will respond to climate change and increasingly severe weather. Researchers at El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest overseen by the U.S. Forest Service, are running controlled studies on how plants respond to higher temperatures combined  since the cataclysmic blow from Hurricane Maria  with severe weather. Not far away, another group is looking at how hurricanes affect the forest environment. ""It's a once-in-a-century opportunity to look at these two aspects of climate change together,"" said Tana Wood, a research ecologist with the Forest Service. Wood heads a team testing how plants themselves respond to higher temperatures. The 2017 hurricane season, with Maria following a lesser blow from Hurricane Irma, has given them a chance as well to see how storms affect the recovery of ecosystems already under stress, a key concern in the Caribbean, where scientists say warmer temperatures could lead to more intense hurricanes. On a recent trek to the site, Wood brushed aside thick branches and leaves the size of laptops as she made her way to three plots surrounded by infrared panels that heat the air and soil by 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit). The vegetation there was shorter and a bit browner compared with the three unheated control plots. The warmed plots run on 480 volts of electricity, and while the lines are isolated from the soil, the scientists use insulated boots to avoid getting electrocuted in case of an accident. Nearby, plant physiologist Rob Tunison clamped what looked like a small compact mirror around a dark green leaf to measure photosynthesis, spending 30 minutes to an hour per leaf. Wood said they are looking at how temperatures affect basic processes such as photosynthesis  by which plants transform sunlight into energy while absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing that gas along with oxygen into the atmosphere  as well as how soils respond. The researchers are also studying nutrients and microbes in the artificially warmed plots of land, keeping sending frozen samples to a lab in California for analysis. Knowledge about tropical plants and soils could eventually be plugged into models to determine how vastly broader ecosystems respond to changes. ""We are also able to look at the potential for tropical plants and soils to acclimate to consistently warmer conditions over time,"" Wood said. Tropical forests play a key role in recycling carbon dioxide, and they store about a third of the world's carbon, she said. They also help generate rainfall across the world by releasing water vapor, which in turn creates clouds. ""Anything that happens in these systems can have an effect on the world's climate,"" she said. U.S., British and international climate agencies reported this month that 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record, and global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide saw their largest spike in seven years. Overall, global carbon dioxide emissions have increased 55 percent in the past two decades, and Earth has warmed on average about two-thirds of a degree Celsius, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. British meteorologists said in early February that the next five years could see record-breaking temperatures. Scientists expect the world this year will spew 40.9 billion tons (37.1 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion tons (36.2 billion metric tons) last year, according to studies by the Global Carbon Project. Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology who is not involved in the experiments at El Yunque, said she was not aware of any other long-term warming experiments in tropical rainforests. ""What will happen at their site is highly uncertain, because the rainforest itself controls so many aspects of the regional water cycle. It's not a system that we can model extremely well today, let alone under climate change scenarios,"" Cobb said. ""But there is little doubt that these kinds of long-term monitoring sites are extremely valuable in advancing our understanding of the water and carbon cycle, and how they might change with climate change."" The $3 million project, partly funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, is in its fourth year and Wood said she hopes it can run indefinitely. Scientists took a one-year hiatus after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, 2017, so they could separate the effect of warming from the effect of the storm, which caused more than $100 billion in damage and toppled trees like dominoes. A couple of miles from Woods' experiment, scientists including those from the International Institute of Tropical Forestry are looking at how hurricanes affect the tropical forest. They began by trimming away the canopy leaves above patches of forest to mimic the effects of a storm. They hired arborists to cut tree branches and spread them across the forest floor to study how light and water move through the changed ecosystem and the impact that the debris has on soil microbes. They also monitor cloud base heights to get a sense of how changes could affect rainfall. Maria suddenly gave them a real-life test. ""It poses a lot of challenges but a lot of opportunities to move the science forward,"" said Grizelle Gonzalez, a project leader. The experiments are expected to continue for several years, barring any interruptions from storms as the Caribbean prepares for another Atlantic hurricane season that starts June 1. Cobb, the global warming scientist, praised the ongoing experiments. ""It is well worth the effort,"" she said. ""The raw beauty of these environments is really only matched by their immense scientific potential.""",21/02/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hurricanes-create-natural-climate-change-labs-in-puerto-rico
Green New Deal rollout rattles both sides of climate change debate,"WASHINGTON -- Die-hard skeptics of climate change believe the rollout of the Green New Deal, with its plans for wealth redistribution, high taxes, and a massive transition to a carbon neutral economy, was a tipoff to a hidden agenda. ""We always knew climate was a stalking horse for socialism, communism, totalitarianism, whatever you want to call it, said Steve Milloy of JunkScience.com. Milloy is what many climate scientists and environmentalists pejoratively refer to as a ""denier."" But even many Democrats who support a climate change agenda saw the rollout as overreach. ""I have read it and I have re-read it and I asked [co-sponsor Sen.] Ed Markey, What in the heck is this?"" said Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill) on MSNBCs Morning Joe. Panelists responded with howls of laughter. Some hope that from the excesses of the Green New Deal, more moderate voices emerge. WHAT IS THE GREEN NEW DEAL? A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE CONCEPT PUSHED BY PROGRESSIVES ""The climate debate has been driven for years by the edges of each party,"" said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""Having a more aggressively unrealistic left edge to contradict the irresponsible right edge is not likely to create the kind of consensus thats necessary to have meaningful change."" Others question the desperate sense of urgency to transition to a carbon neutral economy. John Christy, head of the Atmospheric Sciences Department of the University of Alabama, Hunstville, has long questioned the so-called 97 percent consensus among climate scientists. He notes the greatest scientific discoveries in history have often broken with consensus. Astronomer Galileo Galilei was condemned to life under house arrest for embracing heliocentrism  the belief that the earth and planets revolve around the sun. In 1931, the book ""A Hundred Authors Against Einstein"" was published questioning his theory of relativity. More recently Australian scientist Barry Marshall upended accepted treatment for ulcers by suggesting they were not caused by stress, but by bacterial infection. Today, the standard ulcer treatment is an antibiotic. Christy agrees that CO2 levels are increasing and the planet has warmed slightly, but his research indicates computer models that predict catastrophic consequences of climate change are unrealistic. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ CALLS GREEN NEW DEAL A 'LIFE AND DEATH' ISSUE, ATTACKS GOP ON CLIMATE CHANGE ""I take a real hard look at climate model output and can demonstrate that these models are just too sensitive to carbon dioxide,"" he said. ""The real world is not spiraling off into some dangerous territory of climate."" For expressing that view and others (his research shows that rising CO2 levels have some beneficial effects  agricultural yields are higher than they've ever been, and the planet is greener than at any time in recorded history.) Yet, Christy has been alienated from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, of which he used to be a part. After the rollout of the Green New Deal non-binding resolution, many Democratic Senators took to the well of the Senate to lambast what they believed was a ploy by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the resolution to a ""show"" vote. ""We'll give everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal,"" McConnell said. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it a ""cynical stunt."" ""I challenge Leader McConnell to say that our climate change crisis is real, that its caused by humans, and that Congress needs to act,"" he said. ""This is what two-thirds of the American people agree with.""  An impassioned Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., weighed in. ""Americans see this in their daily lives. This is not academic theory any longer,"" he shouted. ""They see the wildfires, they see the droughts, they see the floods, they see the sea levels rise..."" Christy measurements suggest they're wrong. ""What distinguishes me from many of them, he said, is I actually build the data sets that can answer questions about climate change."" As to Whitehouse's claims of catastrophic weather extremes, Christy said his data did not back that up. ""I actually did a very detailed analysis of that for the United States, he said. What I found is that in the last 124 years, weather extremes and temperature extremes have actually declined, both record high temperatures and record low temperatures."" Novelist Michael Crichton, in the Caltech Michelin lecture in 1993, offered what some might see as a calming reassurance about the future of the earths climate. He looked back to the turn of the last century when people, ""didn't know what radio was, or an airport, or a movie, or a television, or a computer, or a cell phone, or a jet, an antibiotic, a rocket, a satellite, an MRI, ICU, IUD,  or what IBM was... Crichton went on, presenting a long list of the scientific inventions of the 20th century that changed human life for the better. Toward the end of the lecture he asked, ""Now, you tell me you can predict the world of 2100?""",22/02/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/even-moderates-skeptical-of-green-new-deals-climate-change-recommendations
Consumer goods companies preparing for climate change impact,"Companies behind some of the best-known consumer products  from soaps to sodas  are beginning to factor climate change into their business equation, according to a report published Monday. The survey of 16 major corporations by non-profit group CDP found that many are working to lower their carbon emissions, prepare for the effects of global warming on their supply chain and respond to growing environmental consciousness among customers. Examples include brewer AB InBev's efforts to develop a variety of barley that needs less water and Unilever adjusting its detergent formulas so they work at the lower ""eco"" temperature settings on modern washing machines, the London-based group said. ""We were surprised how much these companies were aligning themselves with changes in consumer preferences,"" said Carole Ferguson, the report's lead author. This includes chasing trends such as veganism, a small but growing factor in the market that's driven by people who shun animal products for ethical or health reasons, but also because they have larger carbon footprints. PepsiCo's recent acquisition of Health Warrior, a maker of plant-based nutrition bars, is a typical example where a large company has snapped up a small brand to fill a niche it didn't yet cover. Such purchases help companies bolster their green credentials at a time when they're beginning to feel the heat of climate activism. Consumer goods account for about a third of greenhouse gas emissions, meaning companies that make them play a key role in efforts to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. But manufacturers like Nestle, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble also face growing scrutiny from investors who want to know what business risks they face from climate change before deciding whether to buy their stock, Ferguson said. CDP ranked the companies surveyed according to how strongly their business is threatened by climate change, what they are doing to prepare for it and how much information they disclose to the market. ""Climate change is going to be disruptive to revenues and costs,"" Ferguson told The Associated Press. ""What I would want to know as an investor is what kind of strategy they have going forward."" In general, CDP found that European makers of fast-moving consumer goods are ahead of U.S. rivals in preparing for climate change  a disparity also seen in other sectors, such as automotive or oil and gas. France's Danone came first in the food and drinks sector, while Kraft Heinz came last out of nine; similarly Paris-based cosmetics company L'Oreal ranked second in the household and personal care sector, against New York-based rival Estee Lauder, which came last out of seven. Possible reasons for this disparity include stricter regulation from the European Union, Ferguson said. Consumer concern over plastic waste recently spurred strict new EU rules on packaging, the report noted. ""Product labelling and carbon footprinting is on the horizon,"" the authors added. CDP, which was once described as ""the most powerful green NGO you've never heard of"" by Harvard Business Review, isn't alone in suggesting it's time for companies to publish data on climate risks. Influential business weekly The Economist recently proposed that voluntary climate-related guidelines for listed companies drawn up by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors global financial system, should be made mandatory. ___ Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter",24/02/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/world/consumer-goods-companies-preparing-for-climate-change-impact
"Gillibrand defends Green New Deal, calls climate change 'greatest threat to humanity we have'","Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand compared the Green New Deal to NASA's race for the Moon in the 1960s, telling Fox News' ""Special Report"" Monday night that ""global climate change ... is the greatest threat to humanity we have."" ""Scientists have just reached the conclusion that [climate change is] happening far quicker than we know,"" the fired-up senator from New York told Chris Wallace. ""And, what New Yorkers know and what people all across this country know is, when severe weather hits, people die. It destroys communities."" The Green New Deal, championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and endorsed by several of Gillibrand's would-be competitors in the Democratic field, is an ambitious jobs and infrastructure program that calls for every building in the United States to be replaced or retrofitted to become more energy efficient and for the replacement of air travel with high-speed rail, among other conditions. Republicans have mocked the proposal, saying it would cost trillions of dollars and cripple the U.S. economy. WHAT IS THE GREEN NEW DEAL? A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE CONCEPT PUSHED BY PROGRESSIVES ""When John F. Kennedy was president, he said, lets put a man on the Moon in the next 10 years, not because its easy but because its hard,"" Gillibrand said. ""It will be a measure of our innovation, our entrepreneurialism, our excellence. Why not say to the American people, Global climate change is not only real, but the urgency of this moment requires a call to action to all of Americas engineers, all of our entrepreneurs, all of our innovators to ... solve the problems together?'"" Gillibrand and Wallace then had a lively exchange over Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's vow to not hold any ""big-money fundraisers"" during her campaign. Wallace asked Gillibrand if she saw any contradiction between Warren's promise and Gillibrand's plans to hold a March fundraiser at the home of Pfizer executive Sally Susman. ""I think you do need to get money out of politics,"" Gillibrand said. ""... Today, the wealthiest, most powerful lobbyists and special interest groups get to write bills in the dead of night."" ""Okay, but answer my one question directly,"" Wallace interrupted. ""I will, but "" Gillibrand began. ""$2,700,"" said Wallace, referring to the reported top ticket price for the fundraiser. ELIZABETH WARREN SWEARS OFF 'BIG MONEY FUNDRAISERS' WITH WEALTHY DONORS ""Let me finish, let me finish,"" Gillibrand said. ""I got you, I got you, I got your point, Im going to get to it."" The senator went on to describe Susman as ""whos a dear friend who Ive known for years and years, who believes in my gay-rights platform and believes in womens rights."" ""Okay, but what about $2,700 tickets?"" Wallace asked again. ""Let me finish,"" Gillibrand said again. ""So, whats wrong with Washington is, theres so much corruption. So much corruption, so much greed. We cant actually pass common sense gun reform in this country not because the American people arent behind it  because they are  but because the (National Rifle Association) is more worried about gun sales than they are about the well-being of our kids. So whats really wrong with Washington is corruption and greed."" ""Can you answer my question,"" Wallace repeated. ""Yes, just let me finish,"" said Gillibrand, who went on to claim she would not take money from federal lobbyists, super-PACs or corporate PACs and would not have an individual super-PAC for her campaign. ""Could you just answer, though,"" Wallace responded. ""$2,700 tickets, are you going to go ahead and have the fundraiser or not?"" ""Of course, Im going to ask Americans all across this country to support my campaign,"" Gillibrand said.  ""And, you don't see a contradiction?"" asked Wallace.

"Ocasio-Cortez?? Green New Deal wouldn?? slow climate change, but your electricity costs would skyrocket","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezs Green New Deal would require Americans to rely on unreliable solar and wind energy that would raise electric bills by several hundred percent for every family and business, hit us with power blackouts and brownouts, worsen poverty and do nothing to slow climate change. Yes, you read that right. Even the drastic, unrealistic and multitrillion-dollar energy schemes in the Green New Deal would have no measureable impact on global temperatures in our lives or our grandchildrens lifetimes. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., knows little if anything about climate science. She has come up with a plan that is the equivalent of amputating your leg to deal with an ingrown toenail. The cure is far more harmful than the problem it is designed to solve. JUSTIN HASKINS: GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD DESTROY AMERICAN DREAM, CREATE AMERICAN NIGHTMARE Nine of the 10 desired outcomes of Ocasio-Cortezs Green New Deal mention environmental issues, with a particular emphasis on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from our use of fossil fuels.  The goal is 100 percent reliance on renewable energy in 10 years. This sounds attractive. But there are physical, practical and economic limits to our embrace of renewable energy sources. Energy is required for everything humans do, and the more expensive it is, the more poverty will be exacerbated. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., knows little if anything about climate science. She has come up with a plan that is the equivalent of amputating your leg to deal with an ingrown toenail. The cure is far more harmful than the problem it is designed to solve. Whether we like it or not, the world runs mostly on fossil fuels, which have the advantage of very large energy density and availability, day or night, even when the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow. Solar and wind energy are not free. They are only practical in limited regions, and they require huge diversions of funds to produce relatively small amounts of energy per acre of land and physical resources used. The intermittency of solar and wind energy causes instability and inefficiencies in the electric grid. Across European countries, the cost of electricity doubles for only a 25 percent reliance on wind and solar power. And, of course, air travel will likely always be dependent on fossil fuels due to their light weight and high energy density. You dont want the plane you are riding in to lose power when the sun goes down or on a cloudy day. Its legitimate to ask just how much future climate change would be averted if (for example) the world fully embraced the Paris Climate Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The answer is a virtually unmeasurable amount: global warming would be reduced by 0.17 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, even if the agreements 2030 goal is extended for another 70 years. And that assumes computer projections of future warming are reliable. One 2018 study of ocean and atmospheric warming since the late 1800s found that climate models are overestimating global warming from increasing greenhouse gases by about a factor of two. And even that study assumed that 100 percent of the warming is humanitys fault. The alarmist U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change admits that the fraction of global warming caused by humans might not be much more than one-half, further reducing the threat of warming. And the Green New Deal calls for far greater changes than the Paris Climate Agreement does. James Hansen, the modern godfather of global warming theory, has admitted that only a widespread embrace of nuclear power can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the Green New Deal would eliminate nuclear power. All this points to simple fact: for now, fossil fuels are the moral choice. Mandated reliance on expensive solar and wind energy in the U.S. would make our lives much harder and would make energy much more expensive, hurting poor people the most. And there would be no measureable impact on global temperatures in our, or our grandchildrens, lifetimes.   No one can say what the future will bring. Perhaps many years from now there will be monumental advances in solar and wind power and batteries to store such power, making it possible to rely on renewable energy for all our power needs. But this isnt not going to happen in time to meet the 10-year deadline the Green New Deal sets for complete reliance on renewable energy. Simply wishing for or mandating scientific advances will not make them take place.",09/03/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal-wouldnt-slow-climate-change-but-your-electricity-costs-would-skyrocket
Dire UN climate change report reveals it?? not too late to save planet,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Earth is sick with multiple and worsening environmental ills killing millions of people yearly, a new U.N. report says. Climate change, a global major extinction of animals and plants, a human population soaring toward 10 billion, degraded land, polluted air, and plastics, pesticides and hormone-changing chemicals in the water are making the planet an increasing unhealthy place for people, says the scientific report issued once every few years. But it may not be too late. ""There is every reason to be hopeful,"" report co-editors Joyeeta Gupta and Paul Ekins told The Associated Press in an email. ""There is still time but the window is closing fast."" The sixth Global Environment Outlook, released Wednesday at a U.N. conference in Nairobi, Kenya, painted a dire picture of a planet where environmental problems interact with each other to make things even more dangerous for people. It uses the word ""risk"" 561 times in a 740-page report. The report concludes ""unsustainable human activities globally have degraded the Earth's ecosystems, endangering the ecological foundations of society."" But the same document says changes in the way the world eats, buys things, gets its energy and handles its waste could help fix the problems. The report is ""a dramatic warning and a high-level road map for what must be done to prevent widespread disruption and even irreversible destruction of planetary life-support systems,"" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the report. Several other scientists also praised the report, which draws on existing science, data and maps. ""This report clearly shows the connections between the environment and human health and well-being,"" said Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist. Gupta and Ekins, environmental scientists in Amsterdam and London, said air pollution annually kills 7 million people worldwide and costs society about $5 trillion. Water pollution, with associated diseases, kills another 1.4 million. The scientists said the most important and pressing problems facing humankind are global warming and loss of biodiversity because they are permanent and affect so many people in so many different ways. CLIMATE CHANGE ""Time is running out to prevent the irreversible and dangerous impacts of climate change,"" the report says, noting that unless something changes, global temperatures will exceed the threshold of warming  another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) above current temperatures  that international agreements call dangerous. The report details climate change impacts on human health, air, water, land and biodiversity. Almost all coastal cities and small island nations are increasingly vulnerable to flooding from rising seas and extreme weather. BIODIVERSITY ""A major species extinction event, compromising planetary integrity and Earth's capacity to meet human needs, is unfolding,"" the report says, listing threats to ecosystems, fisheries and other major systems. It notes conservationists are divided on whether Earth is in a sixth mass extinction. AIR POLLUTION Not only are millions of people dying each year, but unhealthy air especially hurts ""the elderly, very young, ill and poor,"" the report says. WATER POLLUTION While 1.5 billion people now get clean drinking water they lacked in 2000, water quality in many regions has worsened, the report says. Plastics and other litter have invaded every ocean at all depths, the report says. ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE People getting sick from diseases caused by antimicrobial resistant bacteria in water supplies could become a major cause of death worldwide by 2050, unless something can be done about it, the report says. LAND DEGRADATION Land is getting less fertile and useful. The report says degradation ""hot spots,"" where it's difficult to grow crops, now cover 29 percent of all land areas. The rate of deforestation has slowed but continues. ""The report provides a roadmap to move beyond 'doom and gloom' and rally together to face the challenges and take the future in our hands,"" said former U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Jane Lubchenco, who wasn't part of the report.

New Zealand's climate change minister punched in face while on his way to parliament,"A New Zealand government minister was punched in the face on Thursday while on his way to the parliament. James Shaw, the climate change minister and co-leader of the Green Party, said the attack happened just before 8 a.m. when a man approached him after apparently recognizing him. The man then grabbed and punched him several times, according to the Shaws press secretary, Peter Stevens, who noted that Hes feeling a bit tender and a bit shaken up after the incident. COOK ISLANDS FORMS COMMITTEE TO SHED COLONIAL TITLE, RENAME AFTER POLYNESIAN ROOTS Two other people rushed to help the minister after the attack, while the assailant jumped in a vehicle and drove away. The politician suffered a black eye and grazes on his wrist, the spokesperson said. Authorities promptly arrested 47-year-old man who was charged with injuring with intent. He is set to appear in court on Friday and could face up to five years if prison. New Zealands Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke to the minister and said he was doing fine. When you go into politics in New Zealand you just dont expect these things to happen, and I know it will be especially challenging for loved ones, Ardern said in a statement. NEW ZEALAND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TO GET DRUG TESTING AT ORIENTATION: REPORT We have an environment in New Zealand where politicians are accessible, and thats something we should feel proud of, Ardern added. We are, after all, here to serve people. But todays events really show we cannot take that for granted. The scene of such attack is rare in New Zealand, a country where politicians often socialize with the public in stores, bars and sports arenas.  The country has had only a few instances of politically motivated crimes or terrorism, while politicians rarely get protection, with the exception of the Prime Minister who gets round-the-clock security detail.",14/03/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-zealands-climate-change-minister-punched-in-face-while-on-his-way-to-parliament
10 times 'experts' predicted the world would end by now,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, while selling her ""Green New Deal,"" said that the world will end in 12 years if nothing is done to address climate change. ""Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z... were like: The world is gonna end in 12 years if we dont address climate change,'"" Ocasio-Cortez said in January. But similar past predictions  even by the most prestigious experts  have failed to pan out. Here are 10 of the biggest doomsday prediction failures: 1. GLOBAL WARMING TO WIPE NATIONS ""OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH"" IF CLIMATE CHANGE NOT ADDRESSED BY YEAR 2000 In 1989, the Associated Press relayed a warning from a U.N. official: ""A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000."" The official was Noel Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, who added: ""Shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s Dust Bowl conditions to Canadian and U.S. wheatlands. Instead, U.S. and global farm production rose, and more than 1 billion people worldwide rose out of extreme poverty due to economic growth. CHERNOBYL MAY STILL BE KILLING US AS BOOK WARNS DISASTER MIGHT BE BEHIND GLOBAL RISE IN CANCER AND DISEASE No nations were wiped off the face of the Earth as of 2019. However, those worried about warming caution that the U.N. officials prediction was nuanced. He is not saying that entire nations are going to be wiped off the face of the earth by the year 2000, Joe Romm, a senior fellow at American Progress, told Fox News. He is saying that if we dont dramatically reverse emissions by the year 2000  then we are not going to be able to avoid future flooding, Romm said. It now seems inevitable that a number of island nations will be wiped off the face of the earth because we didnt act in time, he added. According to NASA, global sea levels rose 3.5 inches in the 25 years since 1993, when it began reporting satellite data on sea levels. The worlds lowest-lying country is the Maldives, a collection of Pacific islands with a population of just over 400,000, where the highest point in the country is 7.9 feet above sea level, with much of it below 3 feet. 2. MASS STARVATION BY 1975 In 1967, a best-selling book came out called Famine 1975! Americas Decision: Who Will Survive? It predicted mass starvation around the developing world due to increasing population. Todays crisis can move in only one direction  toward catastrophe, it warned. Some experts praised the book and ridiculed doubters. TROPICAL TECTONIC COLLISIONS MAY HAVE UNLEASHED ANCIENT ICE AGES All serious students of the plight of the underdeveloped nations agree that famine... is inevitable, Cal Tech biology professor Peter Bonner wrote in a 1967 review of the book in the prestigious journal Science. The exact opposite of the books prediction happened. Famine deaths plunged dramatically as farming technology improved, communist countries began allowing private property again, and the globe became further connected. According to a dataset put together by Our World in Data, more people died of famine in the single decade prior to the books release than in all 52 years since it was published. Yet the book got widespread praise from experts. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich, now President of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University, said in 1968 that the book may be remembered as one of the most important books of our age. 3. GLOBAL FREEZING AS DANGEROUS AS NUCLEAR WAR Global cooling was once a worry to many, such as University of California at Davis professor Kenneth Watt, who warned that present trends would make the world eleven degrees colder in the year 2000 ... about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age. British science writer Nigel Calder was just as worried. ""The threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for mankind, Calder warned in International Wildlife magazine in 1975. ICE SAMPLES REVEAL A MASSIVE SUN STORM HIT EARTH IN ANCIENT TIMES ... AND IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN That quote was dug up by George Mason University economist Walter E. Williams, who argues that there are so many apocalyptic predictions because they have an agenda for more government control ... fear about the environment is a way to gain government control, Williams told Fox News. Communism and socialism have lost respectability, so its been repackaged as environmentalism, he added. Its like watermelons  green on the outside, red on the inside. 4. MASSIVE WARMING BY THE YEAR 2000 The same U.N. official who predicted the loss of entire nations by the year 2000 also claimed: ""the most conservative scientific estimate [is] that the Earths temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years. But looking back from 2019, the temperature rose about half of a degree Celsius since 1989, according to NASA. HAUNTING PHOTOS SHOW DOZENS OF GAS MASKS LITTERING CHERNOBYL AS NATURE RECLAIMS NUCLEAR PLANT BLAST SITE Romm says that, regardless of what that U.N. official may have said, the projections issued in the U.N.s official reports have been good. All of the major scientific assessments of global warming have become more dire over time because greenhouse gas emissions have until very recently kept rising at a worst-case scenario rate, Romm said. Many who worry about global warming acknowledge that some past predictions have been overblown, but say they hope that doesnt distract people from the reality that the earth is warming due to man  if more slowly and less catastrophically than some have predicted. There have been predictions that have turned out not to come true, John P. Abraham, a Professor at the University of St. Thomas who has published papers on climate change, told Fox News. But ... the majority of climate science was proven right. 6. AL GORE SAYS 10 YEARS ARE LEFT IN 2006 In 2006, while promoting his movie An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore said that humanity had only 10 years left before the world would reach a point of no return. Gores movie also featured animations of water inundating Manhattan and Florida. EVE OF DESTRUCTION: DOOMSDAY CLOCK HOVERS AT 2 MINUTES TO 'MIDNIGHT' Yet Gores critics point out that just a few years later, he bought an $8 million beach-front property near Los Angeles. I wish the climate catastrophists practiced what they preached and sold me their beachfront property at a steep discount, Alex Epstein, author of The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels told Fox News. 7. ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE WILL CAUSE NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST BY THE YEAR 2000 In 1982, U.N. official Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the UN Environment Program, warned: By the turn of the century, an environmental catastrophe will witness devastation as complete, as irreversible, as any nuclear holocaust. ASTEROID THAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS CAUSED A MILE-HIGH TSUNAMI AROUND THE EARTH No such disaster occurred. 8. MASS EXTINCTION BY 1995 In 1970, Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wisc.,  often considered the father of Earth Day  cited the secretary of the Smithsonian, who believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct. That did not happen. ANCIENT ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET COLLAPSE COULD CAUSE A GLOBAL FLOOD A 2011 notice from the National Science Foundation quotes researcher Anthony Barnosky at UC Berkeley, who said: ""So far, only 1 to 2 percent of all species have gone extinct in the groups we can look at clearly, so by those numbers it looks like we are not far down the road to extinction. Barnosky still expressed concern over a long time horizon, saying that 75 percent of species could go extinct in as little as 3 to 22 centuries. 9. METALS DEPLETED BY 1990 Scientist Harrison Brown predicted in Scientific American that lead, zinc, tin, gold and silver deposits would be fully depleted before 1990. MASS EXTINCTION, 'GREAT DYING' COULD HAPPEN AGAIN, SCIENTISTS WARN But mining companies found new technologies and reserves, such that by 2019, none of those minerals were near depletion. 10. THE REAL REASON? Economist Walter E. Williams says environmentalists have occasionally tipped their hand about what motivates their predictions. ""We have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have, Stephen Schneider, a professor of Biology at Stanford University, said to Discover magazine in 1989. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest. END OF DAYS? TELESCOPE IMAGES REVEAL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN GALAXIES COLLIDE Williams also cites Sen. Timothy Wirth, a Democrat from Colorado, who said in 1988: ""We've got to ... try to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong ... we will be doing the right thing anyway in terms of economic policy and environmental policy."" Williams finds the exaggerated predictions of some environmentalists unacceptable. Lying is never OK. To mislead people is never OK, he told Fox News.

Climate change is real but the Green New Deal isn't the solution,"I agree with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on one thing: The Green New Deal is a pipe dream. It is neither technologically nor politically feasible and doesnt solve for the fact that global emissions are rising because of China, India and other rapidly-developing nations. It would be potentially disastrous for our economy, and makes such extreme promises about employment and free higher education as to be comical. But we should also address the elephant in the room. Climate change is real and industrial activity around the globe is contributing to it. Dont believe me? Listen to the top Republicans on our leading House and Senate energy and science panels: Reps. Greg Walden and Frank Lucas, and Sens. Lisa Murkowski and John Barrasso. Or listen to the head of the American Petroleum Institute, who confirmed recently that Americas natural gas and oil industry is meeting the climate challenge head-on. OCASIO-CORTEZS GREEN NEW DEAL WOULDNT SLOW CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT YOUR ELECTRICITY COSTS WOULD SKYROCKET So are the CEOs of Shell, Southern Company and other big energy companies, who not only are shepherding enormous corporate investments, but are literally putting their money where their mouths are and tying long-term compensation for senior executives to meeting their goals of reducing their carbon footprints. They understand that meeting the climate challenge will be good for business and jobs because of a rapidly changing global energy market and demand for both cleaner and reliable electricity generation. Any real progress in addressing climate change, especially in divided government, will depend on a realistic agenda built on pushing better technologies around the world that can expand quickly and affordably, give us a balanced mix of low carbon sources, perform better, and are cheaper than the alternatives, so that the rapidly developing world chooses them instead of more emitting technologies. I dont know about you, but Id rather those technologies be developed, commercialized and exported from the U.S. than elsewhere. The progressive wave overtaking the Democratic party has centered its future on outlandish big government solutions like the Green New Deal. These policies will increase the cost of our electricity bills, harm our economy, and hurt consumers across the country, all the while giving the edge to our global competitors. But climate change is not just our problem  it is a global problem. And China, India and other fast-growing developing countries arent that interested in handcuffing themselves with policies that will limit their economic growth and access to power at a time of increasing demand. Thats why new, emissions-reducing innovations for natural gas, coal and nuclear must be a part of the global mix. Clearly, we dont need to agree on the problem of climate change to agree that solutions to the problem ought to be partly based on global competitiveness and job creation benefits to U.S. clean energy innovation. Most people are surprised to know that the last Congress appropriated more money for energy research and development (R&amp;D) than the Congress of the last term of the Obama presidency. These investments included technologies that can capture, store and use carbon emissions from fossil fuel generation. Spending on R&amp;D is an essential element of progress. These are the investments that create the next breakthroughs. Energy R&amp;D is a smart investment for the country and pays back exponentially. The shale gas revolution contributes an estimated $100 billion to consumers every year, and has been the main driver behind reducing power sector emissions in the past decade. In addition, lawmakers in both parties have supported big advancements toward the next generation of zero-emission nuclear power, which is good for our national security and our electric grid reliability. Nuclear is a trillion-dollar global export opportunity and we must not let it slip away. We need to be proactive. We need to be smart. The progressive wave overtaking the Democratic party has centered its future on outlandish big government solutions like the Green New Deal. These policies will increase the cost of our electricity bills, harm our economy, and hurt consumers across the country, all the while giving the edge to our global competitors. We cannot afford to let that happen.  We cant swing for an implausible grand slam like a Green New Deal, that keeps our abundant and cheap fossil fuels in the ground and harms our domestic economy and global energy position. If we do, we will continue to strikeout. We can have big conversations, but games are won with action, and singles and doubles that get us there are the incremental but important clean energy wins that we know work.",19/03/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-is-real-but-the-green-new-deal-isnt-the-solution
Ancient garbage heaps show fading Byzantine Empire was 'plagued' by disease and climate change,"About a century before the fall of the Byzantine Empire  the eastern portion of the vast Roman Empire  signs of its impending doom were written in garbage. Archaeologists recently investigated accumulated refuse in trash mounds at a Byzantine settlement called Elusa in Israel's Negev Desert . They found that the age of the trash introduced an intriguing new timeline for the Byzantine decline, scientists reported in a new study. [The Holy Land: 7 Amazing Archaeological Finds] The researchers discovered that trash disposal  once a well-organized and reliable service in outpost cities like Elusa  ceased around the middle of the sixth century, about 100 years prior to the empire's collapse. At that time, a climate event known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age was taking hold in the Northern Hemisphere, and an epidemic known as the Justinian plague raged through the Roman Empire, eventually killing over 100 million people . Together, disease and climate change took a devastating economic toll and loosened Rome's grip on its lands to the east a century earlier than once thought, according to the study. Finding treasure in trash Elusa was already partly excavated, but the new investigation was the first to explore the site's long-ignored trash heaps, lead study author Guy Bar-Oz, a professor of archaeology at the University of Haifa in Israel, told Live Science in an email. Unlike the architecture of an ancient city, which could be repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, landfills steadily accumulated over time, creating continuous records of human activity. Clues found in preserved garbage dumps could thereby reveal if a city was thriving or in trouble. ""For me, it was clear that the true gold mine of data about daily life and what urban existence in the past really looked like was in the garbage,"" Bar-Oz said. In the dump sites, the scientists found a variety of objects: ceramic pot sherds, seeds, olive pits, charcoal from burned wood and even evidence of discarded ""gourmet foods"" imported from the Red Sea and the Nile, the study authors reported. The scientists carbon-dated organic material such as seeds and charcoal in layers of trash mounds located near the city. They found that trash had built up in that location over a period of about 150 years and that the accumulation terminated in the middle of the sixth century. This suggested there was a failure of infrastructure, which happens when a city is about to collapse, the researchers noted. Based on the new evidence, researchers concluded that Elusa's decline began at least a century before Islamic rule wrested control of the region from the Romans. In fact, Elusa was struggling during a period that was relatively peaceful and stable; it was during this time that the Roman Emperor Justinian was expanding the empire's boundaries across Europe, Africa and Asia, Bar-Oz said. With the empire enjoying ""a period of glorious success,"" it would seem logical to expect that its outposts would be financially secure, Bar-Oz said. Yet the data the researchers collected suggested the opposite. ""Instead, we are seeing a signal for what was really going on at that time and which has long been nearly invisible to most archaeologists  that the empire was being plagued by climatic disaster and disease,"" Bar-Oz explained. The findings were published online today (March 25) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"Joe Bastardi: Climate change agenda is being driven by hysteria, not facts","Throughout my 40 year career as a meteorologist, I have tried to live up to the responsibility I inherited from my predecessors. I was taught to strive for objective truth, irrespective of where the data would lead. Science is not a belief system based on feelings or subjective motives. It is about facts, evidence, theories and experimentation in search of a conclusion. The impassioned speech by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to Congress last week revealed volumes about the intent and commitment of those pushing the Green New Deal. I cant help but question if their positions are based on facts. Ocasio-Cortezs statements about adverse climate effects and policy proposals reflect a lack of knowledge about energy policy and the geopolitical and financial impacts of abandoning fossil fuels in a quick and reckless manner. The world is going to end in 12 years if we dont address climate change, she said earlier this year  a statement clearly designed to elicit panic but hardly based on fact. NICOLAS LORIS: THE GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD COST TRILLIONS AND MAKE NOT A DIME'S WORTH OF DIFFERENCE In this age of political hysteria, we must all educate ourselves on the facts  the actual science. Unfortunately, there seems to be a total lack of awareness about important issues that scientists like myself  who arent paid by research grants  are concerned about. Instead, climate science is being used as a political weapon, and the voices of scientists like me are being ignored or even vilified. I was under the impression that in the United States, all voices and arguments should be heard. Climate science is not settled science. If it was, why would there be a continuous flow of money to research it? For example, is AOC aware that in the fossil fuel era, in spite of a four-fold increase in population, deaths have plummeted? Or that personal GDP and life expectancy  true measurements of progress  have dramatically increased? Or that world prosperity is rising while poverty is falling? And does AOC know that in the geological history of the Earth, there is no apparent direct link between carbon dioxide and temperature? AOC is trying to capture the imagination of young people to exact a specific result  the adoption of policies that cripple our way of life and push us towards socialism. But the charts above are only a few examples of data that should cause us to pause and ask questions about the direction that the Green New Deal wants America to go in. We should also ask why there is such a hurry to get there. For every current event that is used to whip up hysteria, there has been a past event that was even worse, but that people either ignore or are ignorant about in the first place. Extreme weather has always occurred and will inevitably continue. If climate alarmists do not know about the many arguments that question the credibility of their ideas, how is it even possible for their ideas to be seriously considered? Much of what is being proposed in the Green New Deal should not only cause skepticism, but should be considered draconian and even geopolitically dangerous. The migration towards cleaner, alternative energy needs to be done in a methodical, sustainable and intelligent way, otherwise, the consequences could be far worse than anyone can imagine.  Perhaps we should pause and consider why none of the global warming models from two decades ago have come to fruition. Perhaps we should slow down and think about the consequences of allowing our adversaries to supply the world with cheap energy, because one thing is for sure  wind farms and solar panels won't get the job done. The objective reader should examine all sides of the climate debate and should ask himself: Are the consequences of acting hastily worse than not acting at all? I think many are skeptical of rushing forward. We must rein in the political hysteria and fear-mongering that is driving the climate change agenda.",01/04/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/joe-bastardi-climate-change-agenda-is-being-driven-by-hysteria-not-facts
Climate change drove some Neanderthals to cannibalism,"Six Neanderthals who lived in what is now France were eaten by their fellow Neanderthals some 100,000 years ago, according to gruesome evidence of the cannibalistic event discovered by scientists in a cave in the 1990s. Now, researchers may have figured out why the Neanderthals, including two children, became victims of cannibalism: global warming. While prior studies have interpreted Neanderthal remains to find proof of cannibalistic behavior, this is the first study to offer clues as to what may have led Neanderthals to become cannibals. Scientists found that rapid shifts in local ecosystems as the planet warmed may have extinguished the animal species that Neanderthals ate, forcing them to look elsewhere to fill their bellies. [25 Grisly Archaeological Discoveries] The researchers examined a layer of sediment in a cave known as Baume Moula-Guercy, in southeastern France. There, excavations in 1999 by another team of scientists had uncovered 120 Neanderthal bones from six individuals that showed signs of being cannibalized. Later, in 2014, another group of researchers analyzed the cave deposits to a depth of 26 feet (8 meters), dividing them into 19 layers associated with three climate shifts. For the new study, the authors turned their attention to layer 15, a silty sediment layer about 16 inches (40 centimeters) thick, covering approximately 98 to 131 feet (30 to 40 m) of the cave floor. In that layer, charcoal and animal bones were so well-preserved that scientists could reconstruct an environmental snapshot representing 120,000 to 130,000 years ago. They discovered that the climate in the area was likely even warmer than it is today, and that the transition from a cold, arid climate to a warmer one happened quickly, ""maybe within a few generations,"" study co-author Emmanuel Desclaux, a research associate at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis in France, told Cosmos magazine. As the animals that once populated the landscape vanished, some Neanderthals ate what they could find  their neighbors. Cannibalism is by no means exclusive to Neanderthals, and has been practiced by humans and their relatives ""from the early Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age and beyond,"" the study authors reported. The behavior adopted by the starving Neanderthals in the Baume Moula-Guercy should therefore not be viewed as ""a mark of bestiality or sub-humanity,"" but as an emergency adaptation to a period of severe environmental stress, according to the study. The findings were published online in the April issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science.

Ocasio-Cortez claims climate change is driving migrant crisis,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., claimed climate change is a major factor of the global migrant crisis after earlier suggesting that the United States would have blood on our hands if legislation is not passed to tackle climate change. The far-right loves to drum up fear &amp; resistance to immigrants, the freshman congresswoman tweeted on Tuesday. But have you ever noticed they never talk about whats causing people to flee their homes in the first place? ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ SUGGESTS US WILL HAVE 'BLOOD ON OUR HANDS' IF CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T TACKLED Perhaps thats bc theyd be forced to confront 1 major factor fueling global migration: Climate change. But for many migrants traveling from Central America, violent crime and extreme poverty are the driving forces of migration. El Salvador has one of the highest murder rates in the world, due in part, to gangs like MS-13, which was started by Salvadoran immigrants in the U.S. and spread to El Salvador and other countries. In Honduras, nearly two-thirds of the population, or almost 5.5 million people, live in poverty, according to the World Bank. Per capita income averages just $120 per month. Earlier Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez discussed the role of global warming and national security at a House Oversight Committee hearing with John Kerry, the former Secretary of State, and Chuck Hagel, the former Secretary of Defense. CALIFORNIA GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM PLANS CENTRAL AMERICA TRIP TO EXAMINE 'ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION' So I think what we have laid out here is a very clear moral problem and in terms of leadership, if we fail to act or even if we delay in acting, we will have blood on our hands? asked Ocasio-Cortez. I dont know if youre allowed to agree with that Secretary Kerry or Secretary Hagel, but would you agree with that assessment? Kerry responded that we are complicit as long as nothing is done to stem climate change. And were going to contribute to people dying, were going to contribute to trillions of dollars of damage to property and we will change the face of life on this planet, he said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Ocasio-Cortez has championed the Green New Deal, a radical measure that calls for a massive overhaul of the nations economy and energy use to cut emissions.

Amazon employees to execs: Do more on climate change,"Amazon is facing pressure from thousands of employees to take a stronger stance on climate change. The employees signed an open letter, calling on the e-commerce giant to adopt a plan to phase out the use of fossil fuels. The workers also want Amazon to end partnerships with oil and gas companies, and to play a more active role in telling local and federal governments to reduce carbon emissions. ""Amazon has the resources and scale to spark the world's imagination and redefine what is possible and necessary to address the climate crisis,"" reads the letter, which is signed by more than 4,000 workers. Wednesday's letter seeks to build support for a shareholder proposal that demands Amazon release a plan to address climate change. According to the protesting workers, the proposal is on track for a shareholder's vote next month, but company leadership is preparing to oppose it. Amazon's current goal is to control the company's carbon footprint over the next decade, not completely eliminate it. ""Our vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with 50 percent of all shipments net zero by 2030,"" a company spokesperson told PCMag. But the protesting workers say this isn't enough. ""Given Amazon's rate of growth, reaching 50 percent net-zero shipments by 2030 could still be an increase in emissions compared to today,"" their letter reads. The protesting works also oppose an Amazon effort to help fossil fuel companies streamline their IT systems to expand oil and gas mining. Amazon's clients include BP, Shell, and GE Oil and Gas, among others. ""To avert catastrophic warming, the science is clear: we must keep fossil fuels in the ground,"" their letter adds. In response, Amazon told PCMag that the company's long-term goal is to power the company's global infrastructure using only renewable energy. When this might be achieved Amazon didn't say, but the company plans to unveil new sustainability projects this year. ""In operations alone, we have over 200 scientists, engineers, and product designers dedicated exclusively to inventing new ways to leverage our scale for the good of customers and the planet,"" the company added. Amazon's past sustainability projects include creating wind and solar farms to power some company buildings. But on the shipping front, the company recently bought a fleet of 20,000 delivery vans, which reportedly run on diesel. Wednesday's letter is the latest employee-led protest effort at a major tech company. Last year, Amazon workers spoke out against the company's plans to sell facial-recognition systems to government agencies over surveillance fears. A separate shareholder proposal is slated to go up for a vote next month, demanding Amazon stop sales to government clients until the surveillance risks have been addressed.

"Climate change protesters bring London to halt, demonstrator glues himself to subway train, 300 arrested in...","London was brought to a standstill Wednesday morning after militant climate change protesters cause havoc for a third day in a row, climbing and gluing themselves on subway trains, causing road closures and other disruption, leading to an arrest of nearly 300 people in the past 48 hours. The protesters calling themselves Extinction Rebellion, which were also responsible for a naked protest in the British Parliament earlier this month, are demanding the government to legally commit to reducing net carbon emissions to zero in the next six years and are willing to go to jail for the cause. TOPLESS CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS ARRESTED AFTER INTERRUPTING BREXIT DEBATE IN BRITISH PARLIAMENT Londoners morning commute was particularly disrupted after the protesters climbed on top of a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train in East London, prompting shutdown or severe delays on numerous underground lines. The group has been clashing with police officers and blocking traffic in Central London, including near Parliament, since Monday, resulting in at least 290 arrests, the BBC reported. The scale of the arrests forced the police to reveal that contingency plans are in place should custody suites become full. In addition to furious Londoners, the methods of the protest were criticized by left-wing London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who said that while he believes climate change must be tackled, he was extremely concerned about the disruptions. It is absolutely crucial to get more people using public transport, as well as walking and cycling, if we are to tackle this climate emergency - and millions of Londoners depend on the Underground network to get about their daily lives in our city, he tweeted. Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners' safety and I'd implore anyone considering doing so to think again. EXTINCTION REBELLION: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTESTS HALT TRAFFIC The militant protesters also glued their hands to the train carriages as they touted their success in causing mayhem in the capital, prompting the authorities to turn off the transportation systems public Wi-Fi to stop them from coordinating actions, the Daily Mail reported. Some commuters said the protest was ridiculous because it only forced commuters to use their cars rather than using the considerably more environmentally-friendly subway. Transport disruptions reportedly affected 500,000 people over the last few days, while retailers located on the high street say they lost about $12 million in sales in the last two days due to the protests.  Farhana Yamin, a protester who was arrested on Tuesday, apologized to Londoners on BBC Radio 4 but insisted that such actions are justified. I totally want to apologize to people using public transport. But at the same time we need to take actions that are disruptive so everyone understands the dangers we're facing right now, she said. I'm not someone who goes out on to the streets and disrupts and gets arrested for no reason at all. But I feel people should understand that we are at a critical moment in our humanity's history.",17/04/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/world/climate-change-protest-london-glue-dlr-train
Protesters climb Universal Studios globe in California demanding NBC take climate-change action,"Climate-change activists took over the Universal Studios globe in California on Monday, claiming they were gluing themselves to the iconic sphere and demanding action from NBCUniversal.

A spokesperson for Universal Studios told Fox News on Monday that ""Earth Day demonstrators came to the property unannounced and we are working with law enforcement to have them peacefully removed."" CLIMATE-CHANGE PROTESTERS ANNOUNCE SHIFT TO POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS AFTER WEEK-LONG DEMONSTRATIONS IN LONDON Extinction Rebellion LA stated on Facebook Monday afternoon  in addition to noting that one demonstrator was arrested as a result of the protest  that they had ""taken the globe at universal studios."" The group reportedly sent NBCUniversal a list of demands asked that they declare that the world is ""indeed in a Climate and Ecological Emergency  that the extinction of the natural world is happening, that we are facing the collapse of civilization."" In the list, obtained by Fox 11 Los Angeles, was comprised of four different points  including asking the company to ""tell the whole truth about our climate and ecological emergency, including the failure of the US Government to respond with appropriate action/preparedness planning until now."" CLIMATE-CHANGE PROTESTERS BRING LONDON TO HALT, DEMONSTRATOR GLUES HIMSELF TO SUBWAY TRAIN, 300 ARRESTED IN 2 DAYS Another point demanded: ""That NBC reject all advertising from fossil fuel corporations, agrees to be zero-carbon by 2025, and publish a public, annual eco-audit of all NBC/Universal operations, including summary of key ecological and carbon data."" The fourth point requested that NBCUniversal ""only permit think-tank spokespersons or lobbyists on the air to discuss the climate and ecological emergency whose funding is made fully transparent to your viewers in each and every case.""  Extinction Rebellion was also behind a similar protest last week at New York City's City Hall in Lower Manhattan. Of the close to 150 protesters at the event, the New York Post reported that more than 60 were arrested. London's Metropolitan Police stated in a news release on Monday that they were aware of an Extinction Rebellion protest in Parliament Square to take place Tuesday, and have put a ""robust policing plan"" into place.",22/04/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/us/activists-universal-studios-globe-california-climate-change

Majority of Americans think climate change will cause humanity's extinction,"Three in four Americans think climate change will eventually result in the extinction of humanity, according to new research. A new survey of 2,000 Americans aiming to reveal just how much climate anxiety people carry found that nearly half of Americans think climate change will result in the end of the world within the next 200 years. Not only that, but one in five millennials think climate change will trigger the end of the world in their lifetime. The study, conducted by OnePoll on behalf of The Recycling Partnership, found that climate health is a major concern for Americans, with 96 percent of survey-takers saying theyre worried about climate change in some form. Over half of Americans think theyll see significant changes in the world due to climate change in their lifetime, whether it be the sea level rising or their regional climate raising by a few degrees Fahrenheit. In fact, over one in three Americans (34 percent) feel like theyll eventually have to change where they live directly due to climate change. And no matter how skeptical people may seem, six in 10 Americans say they would not consider buying property somewhere climate change experts predict will eventually be underwater due to climate change. One in four Americans actually say climate change is their biggest fear, with millennials being more than twice as likely to say that. Younger Americans are definitely more anxious than older generations about the effects of climate change, according to the results. One in five millennials even ""strongly agree"" that they are not planning on having kids partly because they fear the effect climate change will have on future generations. Though debate continues about the science of climate change, consumers continue to carry anxiety and stress about how it will impact their future, said Jeff Meyers, Chief Operating Officer for The Recycling Partnership. More than ever, we need the next generation to lead the charge in reducing the potential impacts of climate change."" So how important is it to millennials that climate change be addressed? Nearly half (42 percent) would take a $10K annual pay cut if it meant they could live in a world without fossil fuels  only 20 percent of Americans over the age of 39 could say the same. And when it comes to who should help fund the effort to fight climate change, 85 percent of millennials think corporations should pony up and spend at least 1 percent of profits to address climate change. Individuals can also take meaningful action to fight climate change. Over 82 percent of millennials say services  like recycling  that reduce climate change are valuable, and nearly 90 percent say they recycle at least some of the items they buy that are recyclable. This commitment is not without challenges, as 35 percent say it is difficult to recycle and 50 percent say they would recycle more if they had better access to recycling. What motivates millennials? Over 85 percent said they want to find ways to create less waste and are inspired by seeing what products can be made from recyclable items. Millennials want to live in a world of less waste, said Keefe Harrison, CEO of The Recycling Partnership. Whether that means wearing clothing made of recycled fiber, biking to work or purchasing products made of recyclable materials, they are more conscious of the impacts their individual actions and the actions of companies have on creating a sustainable future. More than ever, we need highly-valued public services, like recycling, to continue to drive waste reduction and lower our carbon footprint. So, what are we wasting for? Our future depends on it.

CBS resurfaces 1970 'Act or Die' alarmist climate change clip on Earth Day,"CBS dug up for Earth Day a decades-old news clip about pollution and the environment urging people to act or die, while its current morning show hosts endorsed punitive fees on some urban motorists. CBS ""This Morning"" played the vintage video of Walter Cronkite in 1970 endorsing the Earth Day as a day set aside for a nationwide outpouring of mankind seeking its own survival. In another clip, Cronkite says: The gravity of the message of Earth Day still came through. Act or die. In the spirit of the doomsday warnings in 1970, which have since been ridiculed for over-the-top predictions, the show aired a segment praising Londons ultra-low emission zone that forces motorists to pay high fees just to drive through the center of London. BILL DE BLASIO SAYS GREEN NEW DEAL WILL BAN INEFFICIENT STEEL AND GLASS SKYSCRAPERS Approach central London and you'll see these signs announcing a charge just for bringing your car into town. Ka-ching, about 15 bucks. And if you've got an older car, especially if it's a diesel, the overhead cameras will spot you, and under the new, ultra low emissions zone, that will be another sixteen and a half bucks. Thats over $30 just to drive into town, the segment said. The shows co-anchor Gayle King said the fees are a way of doing a little something to fight climate change and suggested the policy will encourage people to update their vehicles or take the bus. The broadcast didnt raise the criticism shared by Londoners and British conservatives that say the roll out of the policy hits the poorest motorists the hardest as, unlike wealthy residents, they cannot upgrade their vehicles to the required standard to avoid fees. PROTESTERS CLIMB UNIVERSAL STUDIOS GLOBE IN CALIFORNIA DEMANDING NBC TAKE CLIMATE-CHANGE ACTION Many of the initial predictions about global warming voiced in the 1970s have been debunked. Ecologist Watt, according to the Daily Signal, issued a number of bombshell predictions in the wake of Earth Day in 1970, warning of the imminent shortages and the end of crude oil. By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate ... that there wont be any more crude oil, Watt reportedly said. Youll drive up to the pump and say, Fill er up, buddy, and hell say, I am very sorry, there isnt any.' According to various studies, the world oil consumption more than doubled since 1970 thanks to the emergence of industrial powers such as China and India.  American Enterprise Institute, as pointed out by the Media Research Center, also notes the over-the-top tone of the media in 1970, encapsulated by Life magazines reporting that in a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution ... by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half.",23/04/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cbs-climate-change-earth-day-gayle-king
Tomi Lahren: California is the Golden State of Homelessness and climate change activists just don't get it,"Heres a headline for you: California climate change activists superglue themselves to the globe at Universal Studios. You know I have some thoughts on this. The headline is true. On Earth Day, members of a radical climate change rebellion group managed to scale the iconic globe at Universal Studios in Hollywood and apparently superglued themselves to the structure. Why? For attention, duh. CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS BRING LONDON TO A HALT; DEMONSTRATOR GLUES HIMSELF TO SUBWAY TRAIN The group, Extinction Rebellion LA, sent a list of demands to NBC, urging the network to take action on the climate crisis with the following proposals: 1.That NBC/Universal declares that we are indeed in a Climate and Ecological Emergency -- that the extinction of the natural world is happening, that we are facing the collapse of civilization. 2. That NBC/Universal will tell the whole truth about our climate and ecological emergency, including the failure of the U.S. government to respond with appropriate action/preparedness planning until now. 3.That NBC reject all advertising from fossil fuel corporations, agrees to be zero-carbon by 2025, and publish a public, annual eco-audit of all NBC/Universal operations, including summary of key ecological and carbon data. 4. That NBC ONLY permit think-tank spokespersons or lobbyists on the air to discuss the climate and ecological emergency whose funding is made fully transparent to viewers in each and every case. Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez set this stunt up? It sure sounds like it. Maybe instead of supergluing themselves to Hollywood infrastructure, these tree-huggers could use that time to clean up the trash and filth created by this states drug and homeless epidemic. That would be a productive use of time. If they care so much about conservation and the environment, why dont they superglue themselves to Governor Gavin Newsom's door and demand that HE do something about the thousands of needles littering the streets of San Francisco? Or what about the human feces? It's not just in San Fran. The problem plagues the entirety of our state from San Francisco to San Diego and everywhere in between. These climate change groups also conveniently ignore the many third-world style encampments and tent cities scattered throughout our Golden State of Homelessness. Heck, at the end of last year the Sacramento City Council approved a resolution to dole out $400,000 to hire employees solely for the purpose of cleaning up homeless encampments in Californias capital. In fact, according to Caltrans -- the California Department of Transportation -- the growing amounts of trash along our freeways can be partly attributed to the homeless encampments. You think?! Those are the same encampments that Democrats and climate change warriors in this state -- and across the nation -- conveniently ignore. So maybe instead of supergluing themselves to Hollywood infrastructure, these tree-huggers could use that time to clean up the trash and filth created by this states drug and homeless epidemic. That would be a productive use of time. But wait, that kind of effort doesnt get headlines and attention, which is really all these activists are after, right? They couldnt care less about the actual environment. They just pull stunts to grandstand and validate their self-importance. So before they lecture NBC/Universal, or any of us for that matter, on the climate change apocalypse, perhaps they should adopt a highway, adopt some common sense, and adopt a true understanding of what the hell theyre talking about.  I better not see a single one of these protesters arriving or departing from their activism in vehicles! If we are truly facing impending extinction due to global warming, do your part and walk your self-righteous behinds to your protests. God bless and get a clue.

California restaurants may add climate change surcharge: 'We as chefs want to do the right thing',"Dining out may get more expensive in California. As part of an initiative aimed at combating climate change, restaurants will have the option to adhere to the Restore California Renewable Restaurant program and add a one percent surcharge to diners bills. The extra money will go to support environmentally friendly farming practices. SAN FRANCISCO SANDWICH SHOP BLASTS CITY'S STRAW BAN ON MENU: 'YOU CAN STILL GET NEEDLES FOR FREE' Though the surcharge is voluntary for both restaurants and customers, Anthony Myint  owner of popular Mission Chinese restaurant in San Franciscos Mission district, and founder of the non-profit Perennial Farming Initiative responsible for the new program  has been adding a 3 percent carbon neutral surcharge for the past six months and raised nearly $20,000, according to local reports. ""This issue of climate change, is obviously massive and future generations don't have the chance to opt out,"" Myint said to KTVU. ""We as chefs want to do the right thing and shopping organic and at farmers markets doesn't really feel like enough."" Myint, who told KGO that it costs each diner at Mission Chinese about 10 to 15 cents to offset the restaurants carbon use, said 25 restaurants around the world are contributing to carbon neutral programs. The new initiative will take it one step further and raise money for farmers to move away from chemical pesticides and adopt more sustainable practices.  ""If every single restaurant had to do it, it would raise $1 billion annually,"" Myint said to KTVU, also noting the surcharge could raise $10 million annually if just 1 in 100 California restaurants adopted the initiative. The new program was created as a collaboration with the California Air Resources Board, the states Food and Agricultural Department and the Perennial Farming Initiative. ""I hope customers feel free to decline the fee if they don't believe in climate change, or they're on a tight budget, or for any reason,"" he said to KTVU. ""That's why it's optional, but I think it's kind of powerful for all of us to work on climate change by default, a few cents at a time."" The Restore California Renewable Restaurants program will start rolling out statewide in the fall. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS This is not the only upcharge facing diners who plan on eating out.

Beto: We only have '10 years' left to address climate change,"Democratic presidential candidate Beto ORourke sounded the alarms on Monday, saying that civilization has only ten years left to address climate change. The former Texas congressman unveiled the first major policy proposal of his candidacy, which is a climate change initiative that would cost $5 trillion in over 10 years in hopes of reaching zero carbon emissions by 2050. Appearing on MSNBC, O'Rourke promoted his proposal but was asked about his prior support from the oil and gas industry, and whether the relationship would be a problem going forward. ""Do you see the oil and gas industry as an opponent in that? Won't you have to declare yourself in opposition to their interests?"" MSNBC host Chris Hayes asked. O'Rourke responded ""yes,"" but said he is optimistic that the industry will take part in his initiative. ""We know that certain oil and gas corporations have been fighting public policy on this issue, have been hiding their own science and research at the expense of our climate and human life,"" O'Rourke told Hayes. ""So whenever those two things come in contrast or in opposition, I'm always going to choose the people of this country."" ""Having said that, I want to make sure those who work in the oil and gas industry, those who work in the fossil fuel industry are brought along as partners to make sure that we make this transition in the ten years we have left to us as the science and scientists tell us to make the kind of bold change that we need,"" the former congressman continued. GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We cannot afford to alienate a significant part of this country and we cannot do this by half measure or by only half of us.

"Reindeer are eating seaweed to survive climate change, scientists say","As the planet warms due to climate change, the Arctic winters are seeing longer open water spells and less sea ice. It also now rains more often than snow during this period, something that is directly affecting wildlife like the Svalbard reindeer. Named after the group of Norwegian islands theyve lived on for 5,000 years, these 20,000plus reindeer are now eating seaweed to survive the increasingly warm winters. According to researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Centre for Biodiversity Dynamic, the reindeer are turning to seaweed because the plants they normally eat are becoming harder to get to. More rain is now falling instead of snow, which causes the snow on the ground to freeze over (also known as icing), burying the tundra vegetation under thick ice. UP TO 1 MILLION SPECIES ARE AT RISK OF EXTINCTION AND IT'S ALL OUR FAULT The research team first noticed that the reindeers feeding behavior might have changed when the animals started gathering on the shoreline. They're usually further inland, where they rake at the ice with their hooves to get to vegetation. Suspecting that the reindeer were now surviving on kelp, the team set about the undesirable task of collecting poop for analysis. They then compared the stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur values of excrement from seaweed-eating reindeer with fecal matter from the terrestrial plant-eating reindeer. Sure enough, the levels were markedly different, though it was also determined that the reindeer were eating the seaweed in addition to normal food. There are still some ice-free places for the reindeer to graze, though theyre getting more and more sparse. Kelp isnt as nutritious as the tundra plants the reindeer normally eat. It also seems to be giving the reindeer diarrhea, probably from the salt content. Currently, seaweed is being more or less used as an emergency ration, with the reindeer turning to it only during spells of severe icing. According to the study, the kelp-eating has been happening for over 10 years. Its not just the seaweed diet that poses a problem. Unlike the caribou in Alaska, Svalbard reindeer dont have to live in fear of predators such as wolves or bears. Now, as they spend more time on the shoreline looking for seaweed to eat, theyre left open to attacks from hungry polar bears who cant find seals to eat, thanks in large part to less sea ice. MYSTERY SEA  OPENED UP DURING THE ANTARCTIC WINTER. NOW, SCIENTISTS KNOW WHY. So what can be done to help the reindeer, besides reducing climate change? According to Dr. Jeffrey Welker, a professor for the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alaska Anchorage and one of the studys co-authors  not much. [No steps to help] are planned as Svalbard reindeer are not actively managed-they are not fed hay in winter, he told Foxnews.com. More frequent icing events within a year, and year after year will put a lot of pressure on Svalbard reindeer, and reindeer in other Arctic regions as well as caribou in places like Alaska. The study can be found in the journal Ecosphere. ",04/05/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/science/reindeer-eating-seaweed-climate-change
"'Transformative changes' are needed to save nature and ourselves, major climate report claims","A range of ""transformative changes"" -- like a revamped food production system and reworked financial sector -- are needed to save nature and humanity from climate change and other threats, according to a soon-to-be-released report. The report's findings, detailed in a draft obtained by AFP, represent the first United Nations assessment on the state of nature in 15 years and the work of 400 scientists: One million of Earth's estimated 8 million species face extinction, many within decades. All but 7 percent of major marine fish stocks are in decline or exploited. Humans are dumping up to 400 million tons of heavy metals, toxic sludge and other waste into oceans and rivers each year. Since 1990, Earth has lost 7.1 million acres -- an area more than eight times the size of Germany or Vietnam -- of forests that help to absorb CO2 emissions from the atmosphere. According to the forthcoming report, shrinking habitats, land-use change and climate change are some of the main causes of nature's degradation. FLOODING GRIPS MOZAMBIQUE IN CYCLONE KENNETH'S WAKE ""There are also two big indirect drivers of biodiversity loss and climate change -- the number of people in the world and their growing ability to consume,"" Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), told AFP. The 1,800-page report, discussed during week-long negotiations in Paris, is set to be publicly unveiled May 6. ""Feeding the world in a sustainable manner entails the transformation of food systems,"" the report notes. Although the report makes for upsetting reading and does not offer specific policy recommendations, it does map out several different scenarios for the future.

Another, called ""global sustainable development,"" would see politicians and the general public prioritize environmental issues and stringent regulations to promote more sustainable consumption and a way to measure progress based on well-being, not just GDP. There is no question we are losing biodiversity at a truly unsustainable rate that will affect human wellbeing both for current and future generations, Watson told The Guardian.

Climate change missing as US defends Arctic policy,"The Arctic is melting, but don't ask U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to mention climate change. For the Trump administration, disappearing sea ice in the world's ""high north"" is first and foremost an opportunity to exploit rather than a crisis to mitigate. That position was made clear by Pompeo over two days as the foreign ministers of the eight members of the Arctic Council met in Finland. Finnish Foreign Ministry Timo Soini said Tuesday there will be no joint declaration at the end of the Arctic Council after the summit couldn't get the United States to agree on a text that includes language about climate change. Instead, he said there would be statements from ministers and Finland which currently holds the chair of the Arctic Council. Official U.S. statements and documents prepared for the meeting did not refer to ""climate change"" and their scientific focus was limited to reductions in U.S. carbon emissions that predate the administration and research. In a roughly 20-minute speech outlining the Trump administration's Arctic policy on Monday, Pompeo acknowledged melting ice but didn't use the phrase ""climate change."" In fact, his address was largely an admonition against increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic. Nor did he indicate that the administration places any priority on easing the melting that scientists say is already causing oceans to rise. ""Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new naval passageways and new opportunities for trade, potentially slashing the time it takes for ships to travel between Asia and the West by 20 days,"" he said in the speech, which was met with polite but muted applause. ""Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st century's Suez and Panama Canals."" Asked directly about climate change and the Arctic in an interview with a Finnish newspaper, Pompeo declined the opportunity to mention the phrase and downplayed the importance of the Paris climate accord from which President Donald Trump. ""My view on this and President Trump's view on this is what we should put all our emphasis on I outcomes,"" he said. ""We can call it whatever we like, but I shared some of the data in the speech. The United States is kicking it when it comes to getting its CO2 down. I mean, compare it to China, compare it to Russia, compare it, frankly, to many European nations, each of whom signed the Paris agreement."" According to the statistics he presented, U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions fell by 14% between 2005 and 2017, while global energy-related CO2 emissions increased more than 20%. In terms of black carbon, which is a particular threat to the Arctic, U.S. emissions were 16% below 2013 levels in 2016 and are projected to nearly halve by 2025, he said. ""I'm sure it was a good party,"" Pompeo said of the negotiations in Paris. ""I'm sure it felt good to sign the agreement. But at the end of the day, what matters to human health, what matters to the citizens of the world, is that we actually have an impact on improving health. And our technology, our innovation, the R&amp;D we put in in the United States, that's what will drive better climatic outcomes, that's what will create cleaner air and safer drinking water, and that's what I hope the whole world will focus on."" Pompeo again declined the opportunity to mention ""climate change"" on Tuesday when he met with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland who pointedly referred to the phenomenon as she played down a dispute with the United States over the sovereignty of the Northwest Passage. ""We have a very close, very fruitful collaboration,"" she said. ""And actually, as we see the conditions of the Northwest Passage changing with our changing climate, I think that's actually grounds for closer collaboration with the United States."" Pompeo replied by saying the U.S. is more concerned about Russia and China in the Arctic than ownership of the Northwest Passage. ""The challenges in the Arctic aren't between the United States and Canada, let me assure you,"" he said. ""There are others that threaten to use it in ways that are not consistent with the rule of law.""",07/05/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/world/climate-change-missing-as-us-defends-arctic-policy
"Scientists discovered a 2,624-year-old tree in a North Carolina swamp. Climate change could kill it.","A tree grows in North Carolina, and it has been growing there for a long, looooooong time. According to a new study published today (May 9) in the journal Environmental Research Communications, scientists studying tree rings in North Carolina's Black River swampland have discovered a bald cypress tree (Taxodium distichum) that's at least 2,624 years old, making it one of the oldest non-clonal, sexually reproducing trees in the world . (Clonal trees, which are vast colonies of genetically identical plants that grow from a single ancestor, can live for tens of thousands of years.) How old is 2,624 years, really? To borrow an analogy from the Charlotte Observer, that age makes this tree older than Christianity, the Roman Empire and the English language. Researchers discovered the ancient cypress while studying tree rings in an effort to piece together the climate history of the eastern United States. (In addition to marking a tree's age, the width and color of tree rings indicate how wet or dry a given year was ). Because of previous fieldwork, the team knew that a particular stand of bald cypress trees in the Black River's Three Sisters Swamp was one of the oldest tree clusters in the country. That earlier research identified several trees between 1,000 and 1,650 years old. [Bristlecone Pines: Photos Reveal Some of Earth's Oldest Organisms] The new study reveals that bald cypresses have even greater longevity than researchers previously thought. In addition to the 2,624-year-old individual reported above, the researchers found a 2,088-year-old cypress in the same swamp  and there are likely more where that came from. ""Because we have cored and dated only 110 living bald cypress at this site, a small fraction of the tens of thousands of trees still present in these wetlands, there could be several additional individual bald cypress over 2,000-years old along the approximately 100 km (62 mile) reach of Black River,"" the researchers wrote in the study. According to the new study, bald cypress trees are now confirmed to be the oldest known wetland tree species on Earth. This discovery also makes the bald cypress the fifth-oldest species of non-clonal tree on Earth; only individual Sierra juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) trees, giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum), alerces (Fitzroya cupressoides) and Great Basin bristlecone pines (Pinus longaeva) have been found to be older. The world's oldest bristlecone pine, located in the White Mountains of California, is 5,066 years old  roughly twice the age of the newfound cypress. The oldest clonal tree is thought to stand in the grove of quaking aspen trees known as Pando, in Utah. Although the ancient trees described in this study live on protected land that is privately owned by The Nature Conservancys North Carolina chapter, their existence remains threatened by ongoing logging and biomass farming operations (e.g., chopping down trees for mulch) elsewhere on the river, as well as by industrial pollution and climate change. ""The discovery of the oldest known living trees in eastern North America, which are in fact some of the oldest living trees on earth, provides powerful incentive for private, state, and federal conservation of this remarkable waterway,"" the authors concluded.

"Ocasio-Cortez assails Biden's 'middle ground' climate change plan, says it's 'dealbreaker'","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed former Vice President Joe Bidens middle ground climate change plan that is yet to be released, saying its a dealbreaker for the progressives. The New York Democrat joined environmental groups Friday in attacking Biden amid a report that his climate change plan will strike a less alarmist tone and wont commit to a radical transformation of the economy. This is a dealbreaker. There is no 'middle ground' w/ climate denial &amp; delay, tweeted Ocasio-Cortez, who earlier this year introduced the Green New Deal, a far-reaching proposal to combat climate change. OCASIO-CORTEZ SAYS SHE WAS ASTONISHED WHEN MAN LEFT SIGN OUTSIDE HER OFFICE IN SUPPORT OF BOTH HER AND TRUMP Blaming 'blue collar' Americans as the main opponents to bold climate policy is gas lobbyist 101, she added. Were not going to solve the climate crisis w/ this lack of leadership. Our kids lives are at stake. According to Reuters, Bidens plan, which hasnt yet been released, aims to appeal to both die-hard environmentalists and blue-collar voters who voted for President Trump in 2016. The core of the plan will likely include the U.S. re-joining the Paris Climate Agreement and focusing on technology and regulations to limit emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The leading 2020 candidate also teased his plan on social media, tweeting: Im proud to have been one of the first to introduce climate change legislation. What I fought for in 1986 is more important than ever  climate change is an existential threat. Now. Today. BIDEN BACKS HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, SAYS 'WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION' TO PROVIDE IT We need policies that reflect this urgency. I'll have more specifics on how America can lead on climate in the coming weeks. But progressive activist and environmental groups pounced amid the report about his plan. Sunrise Movement issued a scorching statement, calling Bidens plan a death sentence for our generation. Prominent anti-capitalism activist Naomi Klein, meanwhile, tweeted: No Joe, there is no ""middle ground"" on climate breakdown - there is bold, transformative action or there is sinking ground, burning ground and churning ground. Yet some Biden staffers have objected to Reuters characterizations of the plan, issuing a number of tweets arguing that Bidens plan will be as radical as those of his more progressive opponents.  Biden knows how high the stakes are, campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo said on Twitter. As president, Biden would enact a bold policy to tackle climate change in a meaningful and lasting way, and will be discussing the specifics of that plan in the near future. Any assertions otherwise are not accurate, he added, noting in another tweet that Reuters got it wrong.",11/05/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-assails-bidens-middle-ground-climate-change-plan-says-its-dealbreaker

"Carbon dioxide soars to record-breaking levels not seen in 800,000 years","There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there has been for 800,000 years  since before our species evolved. On Saturday (May 11), the levels of the greenhouse gas reached 415 parts per million (ppm), as measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Scientists at the observatory have been measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide levels since 1958. But because of other kinds of analysis, such as those done on ancient air bubbles trapped in ice cores, they have data on levels reaching back 800,000 years. [8 Ways Global Warming Is Already Changing the World] During the ice ages, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were around 200 ppm. And during the interglacial periods  the planet is currently in an interglacial period  levels were around 280 ppm, according to NASA. But every story has its villains: Humans are burning fossil fuels, causing the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which are adding an extra blanket on an already feverish planet. So far, global temperatures have risen by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the 19th century or pre-industrial times, according to a special report released last year by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Every year, the Earth sees about 3 ppm more carbon dioxide in the air, said Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of meteorology at Penn State University. ""If you do the math, well, it's pretty sobering,"" he said. ""We'll cross 450 ppm in just over a decade."" The subsequent warming is already causing changes to the planet  shrinking glaciers, bleaching coral reefs and intensifying heat waves and storms, among other impacts. And carbon dioxide levels higher than 450 ppm ""are likely to lock in dangerous and irreversible changes in our climate,"" Mann told Live Science. ""CO2 levels will continue to increase for at least the next decade and likely much longer, because not enough is being done worldwide,"" said Donald Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ""The long-term increase is due to human-related emissions, especially the emissions of our burning of fossil fuels."" However, he noted that the annual peak in carbon dioxide, which fluctuates throughout the year as plants change their breathing rhythms, occurs right now. The annual average value will be more like 410 to 412 ppm, he said. Which ... is still very high. ""We keep breaking records, but what makes the current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere most troubling is that we are now well into the 'danger zone' where large tipping points in the Earths climate could be crossed,"" said Jonathan Overpeck, the dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan. ""This is particularly true when you factor in the additional warming potential of the other greenhouse gases, including methane, that are now in the atmosphere."" The last time atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were this high, way before Homo sapiens walked the planet, the Antarctic Ice Sheet was much smaller and sea levels were up to 65 feet (20 meters) higher than they are today, Overpeck told Live Science. ""Thus, we could soon be at the point where comparable reductions in ice sheet size, and corresponding increases in sea level, are both inevitable and irreversible over the next few centuries,"" he said. Smaller ice sheets, in turn, might reduce the reflectivity of the planet and potentially accelerate the warming even more, he added. ""It's like we're playing with a loaded gun and don't know how it works.""

Inslee unveils $9 trillion plan to battle climate change,"Democratic presidential candidate Jay Inslee on Thursday unveiled a wide-ranging plan he says would combat climate change by shifting the U.S. from dependence on fossil fuels to renewable energy. The Washington State governor claimed his proposal -- called the ""Evergreen Economy Plan"" -- would create eight million jobs over 10 years as it builds a clean energy economy for the country. JAY INSLEE'S GREEN BID FOR THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION But it doesnt come cheap. The price tag for the plan: $9 trillion in public and private money. I believe America can defeat climate change and build a strong, clean energy economy for working families, Inslee said in a statement. Spotlighting his efforts in his home state, the governor detailed that this plan is built on our successes in Washington state, where we have passed strong clean energy laws and we have the fastest-growing economy in the nation. We need to rebuild the middle class with strong union jobs, while making the investments needed to power Americas clean energy transformation. The Evergreen Economy Plan provides a detailed roadmap to a clean energy economy that grows jobs in every community. The Republican National Committee slammed Inslee in a statement to Fox News. Not surprising to see yet another liberal Democrat propose a $9 trillion dollar plan that has the federal government calling the shots at the expense of American taxpayers and jobs. Meanwhile, under President Trump, the economy is flourishing because of his pro-growth, free-market approach. The choice for voters in clear,"" said RNC National Press Secretary Blair Ellis. First as a congressman, and now as a two-term governor, Inslee has spent decades as a leading advocate for reducing rising carbon levels in the atmosphere to reduce the effects of climate change. BIDEN DEFENDS HIS CLIMATE RECORD AFTER CRITICISM FROM GREEN NEW DEAL CHAMPIONS His latest efforts come as many progressive Democrats in Congress  as well as some of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination  have embraced the Green New Deal, the sweeping proposal that aims to transform the countrys economy to fight climate change while enacting a host of new health care and welfare programs. But Inslee, whos making combating climate change his top issue in his White House bid, is spotlighting his own plan rather than signing onto the Green New Deal. The plan would marshal 28 new or existing programs to shift U.S energy markets from fossil fuel dependence to renewable sources; transform U.S. automobile manufacturing and construction practices; and remake the nation's infrastructure from public transit to municipal water and rural electric cooperatives. Inslee projects about $300 billion in annual government spending over the first decade of the plan, with incentives he says will generate about $600 billion in matching private sector investment on everything from expanding solar energy to rebuilding dilapidating water systems like the Flint, Michigan, infrastructure that has garnered national headlines. Among Inslee's ideas are a ReBuild America program that would help retrofit existing public and private structures to meet new energy standards and a new version of the post-World War II ""G.I. Bill"" targeted to help coal industry workers who lose jobs in a transition to renewable energy. The coal worker aide would include guarantees for health insurance and pension benefits, in addition to funds for career training. Inslee unveiled his plan at an event at Washington D.C.s wastewater treatment plant, which his campaign noted treats one billion gallons of water each day and uses cutting-edge technology to turn waste into 10 megawatts of electricity.

"Britain's Guardian newspaper tells staff to avoid saying 'climate change,' use 'climate emergency, crisis o...","Britain's Guardian newspaper is officially changing its language concerning climate change, opting to call it instead climate emergency, crisis or breakdown. Editor-in-chief Katharine Viner advised the staff in an email Friday that the phrase climate change should be avoided because it sounds rather passive and gentle and doesnt capture the real threat to humanity. 'TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGES' ARE NEEDED TO SAVE NATURE AND OURSELVES, MAJOR CLIMATE REPORT CLAIMS We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise and rooted in facts, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue, Viner wrote. The new guidelines also state that a person skeptical about climate change should no longer be described as a climate skeptic. Instead, Viner writes, phrases such as climate science denier or climate denier should be applied. Increasingly, climate scientists and organizations from the UN to the Met Office are changing their terminology, and using stronger language to describe the situation were in, she added in the email. The newspaper stressed that none of the original phrases and terms are formally banned from being used in its reporting, but do think twice before using them, Viner wrote. BIDEN DEFENDS HIS CLIMATE RECORD AFTER OCASIO-CORTEZ CRITICISM, TELLS CRITICS TO CALM DOWN The Guardian appears to be the first publication to officially issue language guidance on climate change. Other organizations, such as the United Nations, reportedly used different language to describe climate change. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres spoke about climate crisis last year. According to the Guardian, Prof. Richard Betts, who leads the Met Offices climate research, said in December that global heating reflects better on reality than global warming. The Met Office is Britain's national weather service.  The Guardians editorial board also recently endorsed the Green New Deal, a proposal introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey that seeks to transform the U.S. economy in an effort to tackle climate change. Humanity will run out of limited global resources long before the US runs out of dollars. Britain needs something like Ms. Ocasio-Cortezs Green New Deal.

"Octopuses may go blind from climate change, study warns","Plastic pollution and climate change may be significantly altering the level of oxygen on our planet. Now, a new study dives into the impact it could have on marine life, including squids, crabs and octopuses  blindness. The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, highlights how important oxygen is to sight and retinal activity for certain marine larvae. Tiny declines in oxygen levels result in significant vision impairment, including almost total blindness in certain species. ""Using in vivo electroretinogram recordings, we show that there is a decrease in retinal sensitivity to light in marine invertebrates when exposed to reduced oxygen availability,"" the study's abstract reads. ""We found a 60-100 [percent] reduction in retinal responses in the larvae of cephalopods and crustaceans: the market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculatus), tuna crab (Pleuroncodes planipes), and brachyuran crab (Metacarcinus gracilis)."" $2.5 TRILLION BREATHING PROBLEM? OCEAN PLASTIC ENDANGERS BACTERIA THAT CREATE OXYGEN NECESSARY FOR LIFE To test the theory, the animals were put in reduced oxygen environments for approximately 30 minutes. The research highlights that it is likely there is a change in oxygen in the daily environment of these animals due to swimming at different depths, but it underscores the concern that a permanent decline could be destructive. ""These findings may impact our understanding of species vulnerability to ocean oxygen loss and suggest that researchers conducting electrophysiology experiments should monitor oxygen levels, as even small changes in oxygen may affect the results,"" the study's abstract adds. ""I am concerned that climate change is going to make this issue worse,"" the study's lead author, Lillian McCormick, said in an interview with Live Science. She added ""that visual impairment might happen more frequently in the sea."" $2.5 TRILLION 'HOLY GRAIL' FOUND?

"Climate change could raise sea levels by 7 feet by 2100, shocking study reveals","Ocean levels are rising due to climate change and the long-held view is that sea levels would rise nearly three feet by the year 2100. A startling new study has suggested that view is woefully incorrect. Instead, sea levels could rise more than double that amount if global temperatures rise more than expected. If sea levels were to rise by more than two meters (6.5 feet) that the study's authors believe is possible, an event they said ""lies within the 90 percent uncertainty bounds,"" the devastation could be catastrophic. A rise in temperatures by 5 degrees Celsius would cause significant declines in ice levels in Greenland, as well as Antarctica. At the 2 degree Celsius level, Greenland would be the major concern in contributing to the rise in sea levels. NEW YORK CITY COULD SEE 'ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME' FLOODS EVERY YEAR 5 YEARS  For comparison purposes, a rise of one meter put forth by the 2013 United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report could lead to a loss of land equal in size to France, Germany, Spain and Britain combined and displace more than 180 million people. ""A sea-level rise of this magnitude would clearly have profound consequences for humanity,"" the authors of the 2013 report said. The aftermath could severely damage coastal cities such as New York and Miami and the Hawaiian islands in the not-too-distant future. Global sea-levels have been rising at approximately 3 millimeters per year, according to the new study, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors of the new study believe that the 2013 report from the U.N. did not go far enough and only looked at what is ""likely"" to happen and not at the higher probabilities; henceforth, they said it could be construed as misleading for regulators attempting to make decisions. ""Limiting attention to the 'likely' range, as was the case in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, may be misleading and will likely lead to a poor evaluation of the true risks,"" said one of the study's authors, Willy Aspinall, in a statement. The new study looks at estimates of what could happen in the 5 to 95 percent range of events, whereas the 2013 U.N. report looked at the 17 to 83 percent range and expects temperatures to rise 2 degrees Celsius. While a rise of 5 degree Celsius would be considered scientifically unlikely, the study's lead author, Jonathan Bamber, told the BBC that it's important to look at the lower values because there is statistical significance to it. HAWAII'S ISLANDS ARE UNDER THREAT FROM RISING SEA LEVELS, EXPERTS WARN ""When you start to look at these lower likelihood but still plausible values, then the experts believe that there is a small but statistically significant probability that West Antarctica will transition to a very unstable state and parts of East Antarctica will start contributing as well,"" Bamber told the news outlet. ""But it's only at these higher probabilities for 5C that we see those type of behaviors kicking in."" ",21/05/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-sea-levels-rise
Climate change is hot topic in the European Parliament vote,"Hungry tourists stream into the glass-fronted balcony of Michael Recktenwald's restaurant on the German island of Langeoog, with its splendid view of the North Sea and the blue skies above. The 49-year-old has lived on Langeoog for most of his life, and his wife's family has been there for generations, but Recktenwald fears their children may not be able to stay if the world keeps on warming. Concerns about climate change have prompted mass protests across Europe for the past year. For the first time, the issue is expected to have a significant impact on this week's elections for the European Parliament. Recktenwald pointed to the damaged levees protecting the island, which is part of the Frisian Archipelago off the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Islands like Langeoog are among the regions most vulnerable to the rising sea levels predicted to result from climate change. ""The sea level has already risen and storm surges are getting more violent,"" he told The Associated Press. ""The chain of dunes is being attacked more strongly, endangering our freshwater supply."" A recent opinion poll in Germany showed that climate change has overtaken immigration as the issue voters in the EU's most populous nation are most concerned about. Elsewhere across the EU, climate change also features prominently among the top issues  along with immigration and the economy  ahead of the European Parliament vote that began Thursday and runs through Sunday in all of the bloc's 28 nations. ""In many countries, the climate issue has become increasingly one of the top issues that voters are concerned about when they talk about European issues,"" said Derek Beach, a political scientist at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. ""In Denmark, for example, this year it's really almost the only issue that people are talking about in relation to the European Parliament election."" Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg inspired a 'Fridays for Future' school strikes movement in her native Sweden that's spread across Europe, bringing tens of thousands to the streets demanding faster action on climate change. The Extinction Rebellion direct action group upended traffic across London for days to press the point. Both cite spiking temperature records and dramatic warnings from scientists as reasons to act now to fight global warming. Yet what remains an abstract threat to most Europeans has become very real to Recktenwald. ""We're directly affected,"" he said, walking past beachgoers enjoying the sun from behind the wicker windbreaks that are a signature of German coastal resorts. Together with eight other families elsewhere in the world and a Scandinavian youth group, the Recktenwalds launched a legal action to force the European Union to set more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A court rejected their case on procedural grounds Wednesday, but the plaintiffs plan to appeal. In the meantime, Recktenwald  who doesn't belong to any political party  is hoping that European leaders listen to voters who want their governments and the EU to take decisive action against global warming. Parties that have traditionally championed environmental causes, such as the Greens in Germany, are well-placed to benefit from the growing concern about climate change. The party clocked an unprecedented 19% support in Germany in a survey published last week, overtaking the center-left Social Democrats that are part of Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition. ""We are very optimistic that we will achieve the largest parliamentary group we have ever had in the European Parliament,"" said Ska Keller, one of two leading candidates for the European Greens. ""The climate issue is now finally on everyone's lips, a subject that we have been credibly promoting for many decades,"" she added. ""We have very concrete proposals for what we want to do against the climate crisis, for the preservation of biodiversity, for the preservation of our environment."" The Greens had 52 seats in the last EU legislature, making it fourth biggest political grouping, and are expected to gain more of the European Parliament's 751 total seats. Other parties, too, have been waking up to the issue of global warming. Merkel's center-right Union bloc has pledged to implement the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to keep average temperatures increases worldwide well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times. But the party, like many others, has hesitated when it comes to backing tough measures scientists say are necessary to drastically curb greenhouse gas emissions, such as adding a climate tax to fossil fuels. In France, raising gas taxes sparked nationwide protests and created the yellow vest movement for economic justice, whose weekly protests since November, especially in Paris, have often turned violent. That has made other European governments leery of openly backing such a move. Some right-wing parties are attacking the science of global warming in an effort to win voters fearing the economic consequences of combating climate change. Experts say the EU as a whole is possibly a better place for making decisions on climate change than its national governments. ""This is probably one of the easiest things for most voters to see something that only Europe can deal with,"" said Beach. Still, climate change may seem like a luxury issue for voters in struggling economies such as Italy, he said. ""When your 20-something kids are both unemployed, then you would definitely perhaps be a little bit more concerned about that kind of economic bread-and butter-issue,"" Beach said. Uwe Garrels, the mayor of Langeoog, is well aware of the tension between environmental protection and economic prosperity. The island, a half hour's ferry ride from the German mainland, was poor until tourism brought jobs. Now about 1,800 permanent residents and 2,400 seasonal workers look after more than 10,000 visitors during the summer months. Despite a drought last year, locals are unwilling to give up their lush lawns for fear of spoiling the island's idyllic image. Garrels suggests that Langeoog, a 20-square kilometer (7.7-square mile) island in the heart of a World Heritage site with car-free streets and clean air, can at least help make visitors more environmentally aware. ""We can't be viewed in isolation to the entire country or the whole EU,"" he said. ""You can't create an oasis of sustainability on Langeoog if that's not the case in the rest of the country."" Recktenwald, the restaurant owner, hopes the EU election will spur tougher top-down climate action. ""If we do nothing,"" he said, ""then my children will probably experience not being able to live here anymore. That's relatively certain."" ___ For more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections, go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament",24/05/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/world/climate-change-is-hot-topic-in-the-european-parliament-vote
AOC called out by meteorologist after linking DC tornado warning to climate change,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., took to social media on Thursday during a tornado warning in Washington, D.C., and swiftly tried to connect it to climate change -- prompting one meteorologist to call her out for not knowing ""the difference between weather and climate."" The freshman congresswoman began by sharing a video on Instagram briefly showing the conditions outside, as heavy rains drenched the region and prompted a brief, and rare, tornado warning inside the Beltway. There's people stuck outside. We need to get them out, Ocasio-Cortez said. This is crazy."" The Green New Deal advocate then shared a story published by PBS in March questioning if climate change makes tornadoes worse and put emphasis on a quote from the piece that read, ""Rather than lie squarely in the Great Plains, Americas tornadoes appear to be sliding into the Midwest and Southeast."" The tornado warning followed a devastating tornado in Missouri's capital of Jefferson City the night before. ""Tornadoes are challenging to link to climate change links due to their nature (geographically, limited, acute patterns, how they form, etc.),"" Ocasio-Cortez told her followers as she reviewed the article. ""But we DO know that tornadoes HAVE been changing. They are no longer being limited to the Great Plains, and are shifting to other regions of the country."" The climate crisis is real yall ... guess were at casual tornadoes in growing regions of the country, she later wrote on Instagram. Meteorologist Ryan Maue, though, argued that she was confusing climate change with ""weather"" in the capital region. ""The Congresswoman @AOC does not know the difference between weather and climate,"" wrote Maue. ""Let's try an easy analogy: Weather is what outfit you wear heading out the door. Climate is your closet wardrobe.""",24/05/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-dc-tornado-warning-links-climate-change
Five most over-the-top climate warnings,"While there is a broad scientific consensus that mans activity is playing a role in warming the planet, critics say the effects have been blown out of proportion by alarmists. From dire predictions of mass extinctions to a rise in man-eating tigers, here are some of the most striking examples: 1) WARMING IS SO BAD, PEOPLE AVOID HAVING KIDS Birth rates are at their lowest level in decades, and polls say that one big reason is fear of climate change. In one Morning Consult survey done for The New York Times, 33 percent cited climate change as a factor in having fewer kids. A recent Marketwatch article also found young people who don't save money for retirement because of climate change. 10 TIMES 'EXPERTS' PREDICTED THE WORLD WOULD END BY NOW ""I do not see how things could not be chaotic in 50 years, a woman named Rodriguez told MarketWatch. The weather systems are already off, and I dont think its hyperbolic to be a little apocalyptic. Critics say such young people are victims of scaremongering by irresponsible media and politicians. ""Scaring our young people over climate change verges on criminal,"" Roy Spencer, a climate scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, who maintains a database of satellite temperature data, told Fox News. ""The climate system is warming at such a slow rate that virtually no one would feel the change in their lifetime,"" Spencer said. The Earth has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit since satellite data collecting began in 1979. U.N. average forecasts predict a further rise of between 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 80 years. 2) '12 YEARS LEFT TO LIVE' Earlier this year, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pitched her Green New Deal by saying: ""Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z... were like: The world is gonna end in 12 years if we dont address climate change.'"" Ocasio-Cortez has since said that she wasn't being literal  the world will still exist  but she continues to argue that there are 12 years left before catastrophic consequences become unavoidable. On Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez has set her top tweet to read: ""Climate change is here + weve got a deadline: 12 years left to cut emissions in half."" The claim is based on a U.N. report that says such a cut within 12 years is the only way to limit the temperature increase since pre-industrial times to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius). But the Earth has already warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since those times  so the U.N.'s 12-year statistic is about the cuts needed to avoid a further increase of more than roughly 1 degree Fahrenheit. ERROR IN MAJOR CLIMATE STUDY REVEALED  WARMING NOT HIGHER THAN EXPECTED That's a far cry from ""the world is gonna end,"" critics say. ""If we maintain our abundant energy and prosperity, then we'll still be doing great when it's that much warmer,"" Alex Epstein, author of the book ""The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,"" told Fox News. 3) TORNADOES CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE Rep. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted a tornado warning in DC last week, saying on Instagram: ""They are no longer being limited to the Great Plains, and are shifting to other regions of the country."" While she noted that ""tornadoes are challenging to link to climate change links due to their nature,"" she went on to link them to climate change. ""The climate crisis is real y'all ... guess we're at casual tornadoes in growing regions of the country?"" she said. CATASTROPHIC GLOBAL WARMING LESS LIKELY, STUDY SAYS She left out that since the 1950s, strong tornadoes have become slightly less common, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""Strong to violent tornado activity has been going down for decades, so when one happens now it seems unusual,"" Spencer said. An NPR article Ocasio-Cortez shared linked to an academic study that found that tornadoes have increased in an area centered around states like Aransas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. But those increases have been offset by declines in other areas, in particular in Texas. The study reported that ""it is currently unknown if this is due to rising global temperatures or natural variability."" 4) MORE MAN-EATING TIGERS The website ""The Conversation,"" which advertises ""Academic rigor, journalistic flair"" reported last week that an Indian tiger which allegedly ate a human ""tells us so much about the climate crisis."" The article claimed: ""The reasons why big cats turn on humans are complex and can be specific to individuals. But they can no longer be explained outside the context of climate change."" AL GORE WOULD HAVE LOST GLOBAL WARMING BET, ACADEMIC SAYS The article did not cite proof showing climate change caused man-eating tigers. It also failed to mention that Indian tiger populations increased sharply in recent years, rising from 1,411 tigers in 2008 to 2,226 in 2014, thanks to Indian conservation efforts. 5) MASS EXTINCTIONS News outlets around the world recently covered a U.N. report on biodiversity. The New Yorker magazine ran the headline: ""Climate Change and the New Age of Extinction."" Harvard Business Review reported that ""through a combination of human-caused climate change and the near complete occupation of the planet by humans, were destroying habitats and species at an unreal rate (similar to previous extinction events from, you know, asteroids)..."" But critics say that such a ""mass extinction"" doesn't show up in the hard data  that the database cited by the U.N. actually shows a decline in species extinctions throughout the last century, as conservation efforts have increased. 'ARBITRARY' ADJUSTMENTS EXAGGERATE SEA LEVEL RISE, STUDY FINDS ""Extinctions peaked in the late 1800s and the early 20th century, followed by a significant decline that continues today,"" geologist Gregory Wrightstone wrote on his website, ""Inconvenient Facts,"" on which he charted the raw extinction data. While those data show humans are getting better at conserving species, many animals still remain endangered  including certain species of elephants, rhinos, tigers, apes, giant turtles, and others. But the U.N. report itself finds that climate change plays a relatively small role in extinctions, putting it at less than one-fifth of the cause. Far greater is the impact of human encroachment on natural territory, according to the report. Given what some scientists see as climate alarmism, they advise the public to be skeptical. ""People can make up virtually any claim they want, connecting something in nature to human-caused climate change, and millions of people will believe it,"" Spencer said. He added: ""Our young people need to be taught how to think, not be told what to think."" Maxim Lott is Executive Producer of Stossel TV and creator of ElectionBettingOdds.com.

"Biden unveils climate change plan using Green New Deal as framework, after AOC criticism","Warning that we must take drastic action now to address the climate disaster facing the nation and our world, former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled a wide-ranging plan to combat climate change and transform Americas economy. Using the Green New Deal as a framework, the clear front-runner right now in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination announced hes calling for a Clean Energy Revolution to confront this crisis and do what America does best  solve big problems with big ideas. The price tag for the proposal -- named The Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution &amp; Environmental Justice --  is $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years. Bidens campaign said this would be supplemented by leveraging more than $5 trillion in additional private sector and state and local investments. This is considerably less expensive than the Green New Deal itself, for which cost estimates range as high as $93 trillion. But it follows criticism from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others on the party's left flank about his stance on environmental issues. The former vice president vowed hed pay for the new plan by rolling back the tax incentives in President Trumps tax cuts that he argued enrich corporations at the expense of American jobs and the environment. BIDEN DEFENDS HIS CLIMATE CHANGE RECORD AFTER OCASIO-CORTEZ CRITICISM Biden, in a statement announcing the plan, emphasized that more severe storms and droughts, rising sea levels, warming temperatures, shrinking snow cover and ice sheets -- it's already happening. We must take drastic action now to address the climate disaster facing the nation and our world. And he warned that science tells us that how we act or fail to act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. The unveiling of the 22-page plan comes three weeks after Biden teased he would soon be producing a proposal, as he pushed back against criticism by rising progressive political star and freshman Rep. Ocasio-Cortez of New York that his record on tackling climate change was middle of the road. BIDEN COMES UNDER ATTACK BY 2020 DEMOCRATIC RIVALS Bidens campaign, in spelling out the plan, said that the Green New Deal captures two basic truths  that the nation urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and that the environment and the countrys economy are completely and totally connected. The Green New Deal, co-authored by Ocasio-Cortez, is a sweeping proposal introduced in Congress earlier this year that aims to transform the countrys economy to combat climate change while enacting a host of new welfare programs. The Biden campaign said the former vice presidents plan would ensure that the U.S. achieves a 100 percent clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emission no later than 2050. And they said that if elected president, on his first day in office Biden would sign a series of executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track. Other parts of the plan include demanding Congress pass a bill in Bidens first year in the White House that includes milestone targets no later than 2025, make an historic investment in clear energy, climate research and innovation, and incentivize the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy. The campaign spotlighted that Biden would not only immediately recommit the U.S. to the Paris Agreements on climate change  reversing actions taken by Trump  but would also rally the rest of the world to meet the threat of climate change. The campaign also said that a Biden administration would take action against fossil fuel companies and others who put profit over people and knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities air, land, and water, or conceal information regarding potential environmental and health risks. And Biden, long a friend to organized labor, would vow not to leave any workers or communities left behind as the nation transforms to a clean energy economy. Climate change is a top issue in the race for the Democratic nomination, with a number of Bidens rivals in the historically enormous field of 24 candidates releasing their own plans to tackle climate change. Last month, Biden past efforts in combating climate change were criticized by Ocasio-Cortez. She tweeted that Bidens upcoming climate plan is a dealbreaker. There is no 'middle ground' w/ climate denial &amp; delay. A day later, at an event in support of the Green New Deal, she took aim again. Without mentioning the former vice president by name, Ocasio-Cortez highlighted that if the same politicians who refused to act then are going to try to come back today and say we need to have a middle of the road approach to save our lives, that is too much for me. Campaigning soon after in New Hampshire, Biden responded. You never heard me say middle of the road. Ive never been middle-of-the-road on the environment. Tell her ... to look at my record. Shell find that nobody has been more consistent about taking on the environment and a green revolution than I have, he said during a gaggle with reporters.  And pushing back against his critics, he noted that this is a long campaign and everybody should just calm down a little bit and take a look at the record from before. Biden is back in New Hampshire on Tuesday, and his campaign tells Fox News that the candidate is expected to talk more about his plan during the trip, which includes a stop at a renewable energy supplier in Plymouth.",04/06/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-unveils-wide-ranging-climate-change-plan-that-uses-green-new-deal-as-crucial-framework
Gore lectures Australians on climate change in taxpayer-subsidized conference,"Former Vice President Al Gore is in Australia hosting a project to combat climate change -- a push that is being subsidized by local taxpayers to the tune of $100,000 amid a dispute over a controversial coal mine. Gore, who spearheaded the 2006 movie An Inconvenient Truth, has spent decades calling for action against climate change and founded a nonprofit, The Climate Reality Project. In Australia, he has opposed the building of the Adani coal mine in Queensland. AL GORE SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE CAN 'BRING ABOUT THE END OF CIVILIZATION' DURING TALK IN ATLANTA: REPORT It was in that context that the Queensland state government announced last year that Gore would lead a Climate Reality Project training conference in the state from June 5-7. According to The Courier-Mail, Queensland taxpayers are paying at least 143,000 Australian dollars (approximately US$100,000) for the hiring of a convention center in Brisbane, and a project coordinator. The Courier-Mail reports that that could be a low-ball prediction as the state government will only reveal what has been paid in project milestones. According to the project's website, participants at the Brisbane conference will learn from Gore ""how to communicate the urgency of the climate crisis to people everywhere"" and ""learn to inspire others to take action."" ""The event will offer a rare opportunity to learn directly from Vice President Gore how to raise awareness of climate change and inspire people everywhere to act -- just as hes done with the landmark films 'An Inconvenient Truth' and 'An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,'"" an advertisement for the event said. Office of Environment Minister and Labor Party member Leanne Enoch told the outlet that the Queensland government is supporting the climate leadership training by providing funding for the venue and a Brisbane-based Climate Reality Project manager. Al Gore is not being paid by the Queensland Government, she said. But Resources Minister and Liberal National Party member Matt Canavan said the move was an example of hypocrisy and said he hopes Gore can hear the message of how our states fantastic coal creates jobs, powers the world and produces a better environment because it is cleaner. At the event, Gore slammed the decision to build the Adani mine and claimed that financial institutions refused to fund it. ""May I just say. This is nuts. But I doubt [Adani] is ever going to happen anyway,"" he said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Instead, he urged Australia to pivot to solar energy and said it would have hard time selling coal to the increasingly solar-reliant India. ""Since Australia has the best solar resource of any nation in the world, you would only have to capture 0.1 percent of the solar energy that God makes available to you in order to meet 100 percent of your energy needs, he said. The climate project was reportedly expected to dovetail with the election of Labor Party prime ministerial hopeful Bill Shorten -- who had campaigned on fighting against climate change. Shorten would have been expected to attend if he had won. But Shorten lost the election last month, with Liberal Party Prime Minister Scott Morrison unexpectedly winning re-election. The Courier-Mail reports that Gore will run the three-day session from Wednesday to Friday, and students as young as 8 will be encouraged to join a Ministers Climate Challenge to help solve the climate crisis.",05/06/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gore-lectures-australians-on-climate-change-in-taxpayer-subsidized-conference
Bill Nye says world needs to respond to climate change like it did with D-Day,"Bill Nye suggested that the world needs to join together and fight climate change just as it came together to battle the Nazis during WWII. The Science Guy's comments came as he and MSNBC host Chris Matthews were discussing the alleged threats posed by climate change on Wednesday. Nye said he was optimistic about the efforts against climate change and pointed to D-Day as a source of hope. ""I am always optimistic about this because tomorrow is the anniversary of D-Day -- and of course there was tremendous loss and tremendous sacrifice -- but it was part of this greater idea that we have a global problem and we're going to solve it,"" he told Matthews. ""I always respect that ... both of my parents were veterans ... and we can do this! It's the United States and so things are changing."" BILL NYE'S FIERY MESSAGE ON CLIMATE CHANGE CAPTURES ATTENTION Matthews responded approvingly, saying, ""you're our leader, Bill."" Nye, an outspoken activist on climate change, warned earlier in the interview that climate change would pose problems for agriculture and infrastructure. It's not that were all going to die in 12 years, he said. It's just were not going to be able to move our infrastructure -- our seaports, our railroads and so on -- and move our agriculture away from the equators fast enough to feed everybody as we get to be nine and 10 billion unless we get to work.""  Nye made those remarks as 2020 presidential candidates drew greater attention to the issue. Both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. released plans in June that align with the controversial ""Green New Deal"" -- an aggressive, some would say unrealistic, attempt by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. to combat climate change. Both Nye and Ocasio-Cortez have received attention for their bold claims about climate change.

Green New Deal architect says climate change can lead to '25 Holocausts',"Green New Deal architect Rhiana Gunn-Wright sounded the alarms on Thursday, warning that climate change can result in ""25 Holocausts."" The conversation began when MSNBC host Ali Velshi, noting that climate change ranks high among Democratic voters but not nearly as high as others like health care, prompted him to ask Gunn-Wright why there has to be a ""separate conversation"" with climate change versus health care. So in the issues that you just brought up, climate change is one of the main drivers of our public health. So the difference between, say, 1.5 degrees of warming  which is the least that folks think that we can get  to 2, you are talking about 150 million deaths, Gunn-Wright said. Thats 25 Holocausts, right? So how is that not a health issue? How is that not about health care? BIDEN DEFENDS HIS CLIMATE CHANGE RECORD AFTER OCASIO-CORTEZ CRITICISM Gunn-Wright elaborated that on the issue of immigration that climate change will lead to ""hundreds of millions of climate refugees"" from both outside and inside the United States, arguing that ""every issue"" voters care about are impacted by climate change. She also dismissed the hefty price tag of the Green New Deal because the costs of not doing anything she insists is greater.  ""The fact is that we have to start thinking about the cost of inaction because they are mounting and they are mounting quickly, she continued. And everyone agrees that they are higher than what we can even estimate right now. And so you cannot talk about the cost of dealing with a problem if you dont talk about the cost of not dealing with that same problem. She later told Velshi that ""people of color are dying daily from fossil fuel pollution,"" a claim that went unchallenged by the MSNBC host.",07/06/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-new-deal-architect-says-climate-change-can-lead-to-25-holocausts
Joy Behar: Curing cancer 'much more difficult' without fixing climate change,"Add cancer to the long list of things that progressives say are a result of climate change. During Wednesday's ""The View,"" co-host Joy Behar warned that without attempts to halt climate change and pollution, it would be very difficult to cure cancer. ""I would say that curing cancer is going to be much more difficult when there's so much climate change and pollutants in the environment,"" she said. The discussion moved on before Behar could explain the statement. COAL-STATE DEM SLAMS BLOOMBERG OVER CLIMATE INITIATIVE The hosts were discussing former Vice President Joe Biden's 2020 pledge to cure cancer. ""That's why I've worked so hard in my career to make sure that... I promise you if I'm elected president, you're going to see the single most important thing that changes America, we're gonna cure cancer,"" Biden said on Tuesday. Behar, on Wednesday, also decried how President Trump rolled back protections for the environment. ""This president rolls back anything that will clean the air. They're working against each other if they don't also clean up the emissions."" Co-host Meghan McCain, whose father died of cancer, noted that it was unclear what caused brain cancer. McCain argued that every candidate should have curing cancer at the ""forefront"" of their platforms. Biden also lost his son to brain cancer in 2015. He led a ""cancer moonshot"" program in 2016 and created the Biden Cancer Initiative after he left the White House.  As the race for the Democratic presidential nomination heated up, Biden and Trump offered some sharp attacks on each other on Tuesday. The president, for example, called Biden ""mentally weak"" while the former vice president labeled Trump an ""existential threat to America.""",12/06/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/behar-efforts-to-cure-cancer-are-futile-without-addressing-climate-change
Arctic permafrost is going through a rapid meltdown ??70 years early,"In the Canadian Arctic, layers of permafrost that scientists expected to remain frozen for at least 70 years have already begun thawing. The once-frozen surface is now sinking and dotted with melt ponds and from above looks a bit like Swiss cheese, satellite images reveal. ""We were astounded that this system responded so quickly to the higher air temperatures,"" said Louise Farquharson, a co-author of the study and postdoctoral fellow at the Permafrost Laboratory at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Permafrost is ground that remains frozen for at least two years. It underlies about 15% of the unglaciated Northern Hemisphere and serves a critical role in the transfer of carbon from living things to the atmosphere, Farquharson said. [Photos: Perfectly Preserved Baby Horse Unearthed in Permafrost] Farquharson is part of an international team of researchers monitoring environmental variables on three islands in the Canadian Arctic. The data they analyzed in this study, which was published Monday (June 10) in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, was gathered between 2003 and 2016. The researchers recorded permafrost thawing to depths that were not expected until air temperatures reached levels the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted will occur after 2090, according to one of its ""moderate"" climate change models. The IPCC, which is a body of the United Nations, provides scientific information to help guide countries' climate policies. The researchers believe higher summer temperatures, low levels of insulating vegetation and the presence of ground ice near the surface contributed to the exceptionally rapid and deep thawing. The most striking evidence is visible to the naked eye. As upper layers of permafrost thaw and ice melts, the land settles unevenly, forming what is known as thermokarst topography. Landscapes in the Canadian Arctic that had been defined by gently rolling hills are now pockmarked with ditches and small ponds. The ground at the northernmost study site sank by about 35 inches (90 centimeters) over the course of the study. ""We had this flat terrain when we started monitoring,"" Farquharson told Live Science. ""In 10 or so years, we saw the landscape transform."" Their data allowed the researchers to interpret the topographical changes happening before their eyes. ""We were able to tie together air temperature and ground temperature with the formation of this thermokarst terrain,"" Farquharson said. Global implications The thawing has climatic implications for the globe and immediate ecological ramifications for the region. Thawing caused by higher air temperatures threatens to exacerbate global climate change. ""Permafrost is like a giant freezer that contains a lot of really delicious plant material and organics that aren't being decomposed by microbes,"" Farquharson said. ""Thawing opens the freezer door"" and allows the microbes to start converting that organic material into CO2. In changing the physical makeup of the landscape, thermokarst also affects local ecosystems and waterways by inviting new plant growth, disrupting stable nutrient cycles and allowing for the sedimentation of streams and possibly coastal systems. Determining the extent of new thermokarst development is difficult, but there is little doubt the problem is widespread. Farquharson and her team guess that about 231,000 square miles (600,000 square kilometers) of permafrost, or about 5.5% of the zone that is permafrost year-round, is vulnerable to rapid surface thawing.

"Beto O'Rourke says we have '10 years' left to tackle climate change, blames Trump for rise in hate crimes","Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, has made a series of eyebrow-raising claims in a new interview, including that we have 10 years to fix climate change and that President Trump is responsible for a rise in hate crimes across the country. ""The clock is ticking,"" O'Rourke said during an episode of ""Pod Save America."" ""The scientists tell us that there are roughly ten years left to us to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuel, to make sure that every single one of us is doing our part, that we're fortifying those communities -- very often lower income and communities of color."" O'Rourke told the podcast's host, Tommy Vietor, that climate change would be his first legislative priority upon entering office. ""If I think about the single greatest threat that we face, its the fact that this climate is changing,"" he said. He added that the climate changed because of people emitting greenhouse gases, engaging in undefined ""excesses,"" and by not acting to prevent it. BETO O'ROURKE UNVEILS SMALL BUSINESS PLAN TO ADDRESS RACIAL WEALTH DISPARITIES Flooding in Texas and Iowa, as well as fires in Caifornia, were the result of climate change, O'Rourke suggested. His comments came amid a broader debate in the Democratic Party over how aggressive politicians should be in tackling the issue. Both the party's frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., backed the ambitious ""Green New Deal"" proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Ocasio-Cortez, who famously joked about the world ending in 12 years, knocked O'Rourke's own climate plan, saying that it wasn't aggressive enough. WHERE DO DEMOCRATS STAND ON THE GREEN NEW DEAL, CLIMATE CHANGE? O'Rourke and Vietor also took on what they suggested was right-wing ""radicalization"" online. ""Young people are on there and are receiving an education in intolerance thats going to manifest itself in violence,"" O'Rourke said before blaming Trump for a rise in hate crimes.  ""Youve seen a rise in hate crimes -- every single one of the last three years in this country -- and much of that is Donald Trump,"" he said before adding that a lot also came from the internet. O'Rourke has been lagging in the polls but still led many of the long list of candidates vying for the party's nomination. He was also able to score a spot at the first Democratic primary debates which will take place on June 26 and 27.",21/06/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/beto-orourke-climate-change-trump-hate-crimes
70 climate change protesters arrested outside of New York Times building in NYC,"Police arrested 70 people outside of The New York Times building in Times Square on Saturday as they protested news coverage of climate change.

BRITISH LAWMAKER SUSPENDED AFTER VIDEO SHOWS HIM VIOLENTLY GRABBING FEMALE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTER BY NECK The demonstrators also hung banners on the building and on the Port Authority Bus Terminal, located across the street. One protester told The Guardian she planned to be arrested because we want The New York Times as well as all the other media to treat climate change as the crisis it is,"" while a spokesperson for the group told The Associated Press they want the media to report on ""the climate emergency"" so that ""people can start pushing for more radical responses."" A spokesperson for the Times told Fox News on Sunday it disputed the characterization that they don't report on climate change. There is no national news organization that devotes more time, staff or resources to producing deeply reported coverage to help readers understand climate change than The New York Times,"" the spokesperson said. ""In 2018, we published 795 articles about the climate, ranging from investigative stories about the rollback of environmental regulations to dispatches from around the world showing the on-the-ground effects of climate change""  Demonstrators with Extinction Rebellion, an environmental activist group, have been blocking traffic in an effort to protest climate change coverage around the world in recent months.

Medical groups call climate change a 'health emergency' ahead of Democratic debate,"Dozens of medical and public health groups described climate change as a ""true public health emergency"" requiring ""urgent action"" ahead of the first Democratic primary debate of the 2020 election cycle. ""The health, safety and well-being of millions of people in the U.S. have already been harmed by human-caused climate change, and health risks in the future are dire without urgent action to fight climate change,"" the organizations wrote in an introduction to the agenda that was released Tuesday. DOZENS OF CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS ARRESTED OUTSIDE NY TIMES BUILDING The policy agenda endorsed by groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Heart Association included a call to meet and strengthen U.S. commitments under the 2015 United Nations climate agreement from which Trump has vowed to withdraw. It also called for a transition ""away from the use of coal, oil and natural gas to clean, safe and renewable energy and energy efficiency. The groups are also pushing for some form of carbon pricing, although without any reference to potential taxation of emissions, and a plan and timeline for reduction of fossil fuel extraction in the U.S. However, they do not join some Democratic candidates in calling for an outright ban on the oil and gas extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which involves injecting high-pressure mixtures of water, sand or gravel and chemicals into rock. INSLEE RAMPS UP PUSH FOR DNC TO HOLD CLIMATE CHANGE DEBATE Other groups signing onto the list of climate policy priorities include the American Lung Association, the American College of Physicians and multiple state-level and academic public health organizations.  Ed Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University said that speaking about climate change as a public health issue can give Americans a new perspective on viewing the subject. Its incredibly helpful when health professionals point out the actual reality of the situation, point out that this is also a threat to our health and well-being now... and its likely to get worse, much worse if we dont take action to address it, he said.

UN report warns coming 'climate apartheid' will split Earth between 'those who escape' and 'those who will ...,"A particularly dire report from the United Nations Human Rights Council has upped the ante in the fight against climate change, warning that a potential ""climate apartheid"" could fracture the global population, splitting the planet between the wealthy and the rest of the world who will be ""left to suffer."" The report, published on June 25 and written by U.N. human rights and poverty specialist Philip Alston, combines the work of more than 100 other studies and reports. It goes into particular detail about what will happen if there is too great of a reliance on the private sector to combat the changing climate. ""Rather than helping the world adapt to climate change, privatizing basic services and social protection may be a form of maladaptation,"" Alston wrote in the report. ""When hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc in New York in 2012, stranding low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers without access to power and healthcare, the Goldman Sachs headquarters was protected by tens of thousands of its own sandbags and power from its generator."" STUNNING PHOTO SHOWS DOGS 'WALKING ON WATER' AMID GREENLAND ICE CRISIS  The report continues: ""Private white-glove firefighters have been dispatched to save the mansions of high-end insurance customers from wildfires. 'An over-reliance on the private sector could lead to a climate apartheid scenario in which the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger, and conflict, while the rest of the world is left to suffer.'"" Alston likened it to a coming ""climate apartheid,"" where the wealthy are able to mitigate some of the potentially catastrophic effects, such as food insecurity, disease and death, and the poor, ""who have contributed the least to emissions and have the least capacity to react, will be the most harmed."" The poorest 3.5 billion people are responsible for just 10 percent of carbon emissions, while the richest 10 percent are responsible for a ""full half,"" Alston estimated. He added that someone in the wealthiest 1 percent ""uses 175 times more carbon than one in the bottom 10 percent."" A 2017 report from non-profit CDP estimated that just 100 companies around the world were responsible for 71 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Saudi Aramco and several others were mentioned as the highest emitters since 1988. The hardest hit areas around the globe would be sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America, who may bear as much as 75 percent of the costs associated with climate change, according to the latest U.N. report. PLASTIC POLLUTION IN WORLDS' OCEANS COULD HAVE $2.5 TRILLION IMPACT, STUDY SAYS Particularly sobering speeches about the potential impacts to come have not been enough, Alston wrote, adding that addressing climate change ""will require a fundamental shift in the global economy, decoupling improvements in economic well-being from fossil fuel emissions."" ""Although climate change has been on the human rights agenda for well over a decade, it remains a marginal concern for most actors,"" Alston explained in the report. ""Yet it represents an emergency without precedent and requires bold and creative thinking from the human rights community, and a radically more robust, detailed, and coordinated approach."" The report highlighted examples, such as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro allowing the mining of the Amazon rainforest and China, which is moving towards ending its reliance on coal but is exporting coal-fired powered plants abroad. Alston also mentioned the U.S., which under President Trump has said it would pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Trump has also been ""aggressive"" in rolling back environmental regulations and ""is actively silencing and obfuscating climate science."" Following his meeting with Prince Charles earlier this month, Trump said he told Charles, one of the world's highest-profile climate campaigners, the U.S. has among the cleanest climates in the world, seemingly equating pollution to climate change. Trump was interviewed by Piers Morgan after his meeting with the royal family and he told the British television host, ""I believe that there's a change in weather and I think it changes both ways."" MELTING PERMAFROST IN ARCTIC WILL HAVE $70 TRILLION IMPACT, NEW STUDY SAYS Despite the seemingly bleak nature of the report, Alston did point out some positive developments taken by the global community in the fight against climate change. He mentioned that 49 countries have already seen a decline in emissions; more than 7,000 cities, 245 regions, and 6,000 companies have committed to climate mitigation; coal is no longer competitive and lawsuits that have claimed governments have a ""legal duty to prevent climate change."" Earlier this week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said renewable energy sources provided more energy than coal for the first time ever in April.

"Daniel Turner: Decades ago, the UN promised climate disaster; so why hasn't it arrived?","Im not quite old enough to remember the ""global cooling"" scare of the 1970s and the medias drumbeat of the coming ice age that would end mankind. But I have been told many times the end is near by doomsday prophets who have frightened people into green orthodoxy better than any cult leader. As an 8-year-old kid I was particularly jarred by an episode of the TV show Diffrent Strokes in which acid rain caused Kimberleys hair to turn green. I lived in New York City just like the TV character, I believed my rain was poison. Throughout high school I was told that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and aerosols were tearing a hole in the ozone layer, and that it could never be repaired. Deadly UV rays would give us all cancer because I used spray deodorant. I switched to roll-on. BETO O'ROURKE SAYS WE HAVE '10 YEARS' LEFT TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE, BLAMES TRUMP FOR RISE IN HATE CRIMES Then came the mother of all doomsday scenarios: global warming. It blew away other environmental issues like candles on a cake. Deadly heat and floods. Ice caps melting. Polar bears dying. Alligators and sharks invading. TV shows. Movies. Books. Former Vice President Al Gore warned we were all going to die from global warming. Thirty years ago this week, the United Nations issued a global warming report that I distinctly remember. It predicted worldwide disaster. According to the report, the Great Plains of America would return to the Dust Bowl. The oceans would rise by several feet, causing low-lying countries like the Maldive Islands and Bangladesh to be underwater. The report said North Africa would bake into wastelands. Rainforests would be gone, as would much animal life. And it was all because of fossil fuels. American greed. Us. Me. Switching deodorant did nothing to stop it. Tough lessons for a 15-year-old high school sophomore. And here we are 30 years later, and I look back at that 1989 report, I think only this: What happened? The predictions in the report were not just a bit off""  like my calculations in my high school math class, my understanding of Shakespeare, or my failed attempt to high jump. The U.N. report was flat-out wrong. It was 100 percent, complete opposite, 180-degree wrong. Can I get an explanation, please? The report claimed even the most conservative scientists said there was nothing we could do to stop the Earth from warming three degrees. But Earth didnt warm that much. The report claimed we had a 10-year window to fix this or it would be irreversible. It wasnt. The report claimed the Soviet Union would have a bumper crop harvest because of shifting weather patterns. The Soviet Union collapsed months later. Id be OK if this were a one-time mistake, but the U.N. continues to issue such hyperbolic reports. Its International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued the latest one last December, and it, too, triggered a countdown clock. The phrase we have 12 years to fix this is parroted by almost every 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and their partys de facto leader, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. On the bright side, we were told we had 10 years in 1989, so at least the prognosis is better this time. Why issue another report without correcting the first one? Thats not the scientific method. Can we ask for a correction? Heres a simple question: What did the U.N. report get wrong in 1989? After all, this is ""science,"" and one is expected to believe in science. So lets lay out the facts dispassionately and objectively, as any unbiased scientist would. Please identify the error and methodological change or formula or data point that has been corrected. Show your work. Otherwise, why should we believe you got it right 30 years later? Surely the IPCC has the means to do an after-action review. Since the report was issued the IPCC has raked in over $150 million. Looks like theres a prophet making a profit. No presidential candidate, and practically no politician, would ever say he or she is skeptical of these U.N. predictions. ""Climate denier"" is an accusation akin to ""war criminal,"" and with a leftist movement that is growing more violent and assaulting and doxing journalists, its almost imprudent to voice an alternative view.  But the U.N. has a 30-year track record of being wrong on this issue, so I take its reports on climate change and ""we have 12 years left"" with a grain of salt the size of the Maldives. In 30 more years, Ill be 75. I cant wait to read the U.N. report. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DANIEL TURNER",05/07/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/daniel-turner-un-climate-disaster
Liberty Vittert: Climate change alarmists deny science in misrepresenting June's heatwave,"There is no doubt that climate change is an issue that needs to be discussed and addressed. But alarmist headlines and personal agendas only give climate change deniers more ammunition in the fight against real science that tells us we need to pay attention to climate change. In response to a report from a European Satellite Agency, everyone from CNN to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is howling from the rooftops about June being ""the hottest month ever recorded on Earth."" The report has been interpreted to show that the global average temperature this June was about 0.18 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the previous record set in June 2016. DANIEL TURNER: DECADES AGO, THE UN PROMISED CLIMATE DISASTER; SO WHY HASN'T IT ARRIVED? According to the same headlines and tweets, experts say that climate change is to blame. Lets take a look. First, many have mistakenly called it the hottest month ever recorded. What the report actually said is that it was the hottest June ever recorded, not the hottest month. Second, technically speaking, yes, it is the hottest June ""ever recorded."" But recordings are only officially recognized back to the 1880s. During the Hadean period billions of years ago, Earth had a surface temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit. We do not have enough reliable data from historical times, and we simply dont know what the temperatures were to the level of precision we have today. That still leaves us with the thought that this June was the hottest in the past 139 years. Is that true? Maybe. Whether 2017 was warmer or cooler than 2015, or 2014 or 2013 really doesnt prove anything. The only way to see a pattern is to look at long-term temperature changes spanning hundreds of years, along with many other measurements. When average global temperatures are taken, there is always a margin of error on the measurement. It is impossible to find the one true value. There is always a plus or minus associated with the finding (and sometimes the plus or minus is greater than the alleged increase or decrease). For instance, an old NASA press release projected that 2015 would be the hottest year ever. The agency predicted it would break the record by .02 degrees Celsius. However, the margin of error was plus or minus 0.1 degrees Celsius, larger than the projected increase. In other words, they had no idea what was going to happen. Now, after a significant amount of searching, I couldnt find the statistical details of this on the Copernicus Climate Change Services (European Commission) website (where the official statement of Junes heat wave came from), but I can promise you, there is a plus or minus attached to the 0.18 increase. Lets give these measurements the benefit of the doubt and say that this June was .18 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the previous hottest June. Even if true, it is basically irrelevant to decision-making. Variation is the spice of life, and it exists abundantly in nature. Whether 2017 was warmer or cooler than 2015, or 2014 or 2013 really doesnt prove anything. The only way to see a pattern is to look at long-term temperature changes spanning hundreds of years, along with many other measurements. Yes, the trend is warming. Yes, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and we know its concentration has increased drastically since the industrial revolution. Yes, we know it is harmful.  But if we are so desperate to get our points across that we embrace alarmism, we demean the real science that tells us that we do need to pay attention to the environment, and we inevitably give climate change deniers enormous ammunition. Climate change zealots vilify climate change deniers for denying science. Unfortunately, much of the time, they do exactly the same.

Want to fight climate change? Plant 1 trillion trees.,"Want to help save the world from climate change? Then grab some seeds, or some seedlings, and start planting trees like there's no tomorrow. At least 1 trillion of them, and fast. That may sound like a lot of trees, but the Earth has room for their gnarled bows and branches. In a new study that excluded cities and agricultural areas, researchers found that the planet has nearly 3.5 million square miles (9 million square kilometers) to spare for trees. Such newly planted trees could cut carbon (a part of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere by nearly 25%, bringing it down to levels not seen for nearly 100 years, the scientists said. [Image Gallery: A Rainbow of Fall Leaves] The study shows where in the world these trees could be planted, and how much carbon they could store. (Trees take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it in a process called photosynthesis, which allows them to grow, ultimately storing that carbon in their leaves and other parts.) Russia has the most space at 583,000 square miles (1.5 million square km), followed by the United States at 397,700 square miles (1 million square km), the researchers found. The next top contenders are Canada with 302,700 square miles (784,000 square km), Australia with 223,900 square miles (578,900 square km), Brazil with 191,900 square miles (497,000 square km), and China with 155,200 square miles (402,000 square km) available for new green shoots. In all, this area is equal to about the size of the United States. ""We all knew restoring forests could play a part in tackling climate change, but we had no scientific understanding of what impact this could make,"" study senior author Thomas Crowther, an assistant professor of ecology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich (ETH Zurich), said in a statement. The team's calculation ""shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today,"" Crowther added. Planting trees in these regions would increase Earth's forest-covered land by a third, all without affecting land humans use for cities and agriculture. Once these trees have matured, they could store 225 billion tons (205 billion metric tons) of carbon, or about two-thirds of the 330 billion tons (300 billion metric tons) of carbon that humans have released into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution began. The unfolding greenery could help limit Earth's warming climate. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report found that adding an additional 3.8 million square miles (10 million square km) of forestland could limit climate change to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by 2050. But this number may change, as climate change factors tend to accelerate quickly, meaning that even more trees than the IPCC calculated in their report may be needed to achieve that goal, the researchers said. The Swiss team came up with their forecasts by using a dataset of nearly 80,000 forests and combining that with Google Earth Engine, which allowed them to make a predictive model of tree cover. However, even if the trees are planted pronto, their effects won't be immediate. ""It will take decades for new forests to mature and achieve this potential,"" Crowther said. ""It is vitally important that we protect the forests that exist today, pursue other climate solutions and continue to phase out fossil fuels from our economies in order to avoid dangerous climate change."" The study was published online yesterday (July 4) in the journal Science.

Sanders compares climate change push to Pearl Harbor response as he unveils emergency resolution,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Tuesday compared the push to combat climate change to the response to the attack on Pearl Harbor as he unveiled legislation that would declare a climate emergency"" and demand a massive-scale mobilization to tackle it. In some ways...Im reminded today in terms of the crisis that we face in climate change about where the United States was in 1941 when it was attacked at Pearl Harbor, and what happened at that point, having to fight a war on two fronts in the East and in Europe, the United States came together and within three years it had created the type of armaments program that was necessary to, in fact, win the war, he said in a conference call with reporters. OCASIO-CORTEZ, SANDERS CALL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION He went on to argue that fighting climate change was do-able, but it needed greater political will in Washington D.C. -- particularly from President Trump, whom he called ignorant on the issue. So I dont think the issue here isnt that we cant address this problem, i think we can, I think we know exactly what has to be done, and that is massive investment in sustainable energy, massive investments in energy efficiency, transform our transportation system, we know what has to be done, but the problem is the lack of political will, he said. He made his remarks as he, along with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., was set to introduce a non-binding resolution in Congress to declare a climate emergency"" that calls for a ""massive-scale mobilization to halt, reverse, and address its consequences and causes."" Ocasio-Cortez said that the U.S. has fewer than 12 years to act to combat the crisis, and echoed Sanders sentiment that it was a question of political will, rather than how to act. We know that the scientific consensus is here, the solutions are right in front of us but...this is not just a scientific crisis, not just an environmental crisis, a climate crisis but this is a political crisis of inaction, and its going to take political will, political courage in order for us to treat us this issue with the urgency that the next generation needs in order for us to preserve our way of life and preserve our planet as much as we possibly can,"" she said. The resolution calls for a wide-scale mobilization to combat the emergency and restore the climate for future generations. The global warming caused by human activities, claims the draft resolution, according to the Mother Jones magazine, has resulted in a climate emergency that ... demands a national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization of the resources and labor of the United States at a massive-scale. GREEN NEW DEAL FAILS SENATE TEST VOTE AS DOZENS OF DEMOCRATS VOTE 'PRESENT' Ocasio-Cortez and Blumenauer, meanwhile, also wrote to fellow members of Congress urging them to declare climate change an emergency in a bid to swiftly mobilize federal resources in response. The resolution, according to the outlet, details how climate change impacts public health and the national security of the U.S., though it doesnt make any exact recommendations for how to address the so-called emergency. The latest declaration from Democrats comes after Ocasio-Cortezs signature Green New Deal, a sweeping Democratic proposal for dealing with climate change, failed a test vote in the U.S. Senate in March, with 42 Democrats and Sanders voting present.  Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, dismissed the resolution as a political stunt. After six months in the majority, House Democrats have made no legislative progress on addressing climate change; so, theyve resorted to political stunts. Where are the results? If the Green New Deal is their solution, then they should hold a hearing,"" he said in a statement. ""Congressional hearings with climate change in the title is not progress; lets work together on commonsense solutions to produce real results. We need to continue our thoughtful and measured approach to reduce our emissions, boost clean energy production, and protect Americas economy and workers. Both the New York Democrat and her colleagues decried Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells move to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote, saying the Republicans purposely rushed the vote while McConnell said he only wanted Democrats to go on record to support the sweeping proposal that he himself called a radical, top-down, socialist makeover of the entire U.S. economy. The Green New Deal calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming.

"Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders call for climate change emergency mobilization, seeks a re-do of failed Green New Deal","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders will introduce Tuesday a resolution declaring a climate change emergency, a move that comes after the Green New Deal failed to take off the ground earlier this year.

"AOC?? top aide admits Green New Deal about the economy, not climate","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezs chief of staff recently admitted that the Green New Deal was not conceived as an effort to deal with climate change, but instead a how-do-you-change-the-entire economy thing -- a remark likely to fuel Republican claims that the deal is nothing more than a thinly veiled socialist takeover of the U.S. economy. The interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasnt originally a climate thing at all, Saikat Chakrabarti said in May, according to The Washington Post. SANDERS COMPARES CLIMATE CHANGE PUSH TO PEARL HARBOR RESPONSE AS HE UNVEILS EMERGENCY RESOLUTION He reportedly made the remarks to Sam Ricketts, climate director for 2020 hopeful and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who the Post says greeted the statement with an attentive poker face. Do you guys think of it as a climate thing? Chakrabarti then asked. Because we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing. The Green New Deal, once an idea on the fringe left of the Democratic Party, has picked up significant mainstream support this year, with a number of top 2020 contenders signing their names to a non-binding resolution pushed by Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. Ocasio-Cortez has called the deal a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy. The plan, which would cost trillions, sees the U.S. taking a leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation. PELOSI THROWS SHADE AS GREEN NEW DEAL UNVEILED: 'GREEN DREAM OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT' It goes on to say that a new national social, industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal is an opportunity to tackle systemic injustices of minority groups, create millions of high-wage jobs and provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States. Its goals include net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, job creation, massive infrastructure investment, a guarantee of clean water and food, and an access to nature. It calls for the government to upgrade buildings and power sources to meet a 100 percent clean energy goals. But, perhaps hinting at what Chakrabarti said, it also includes a job guarantee plan that would provide all people in the U.S. a family-sustaining wage, family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security. Republicans have responded with delight to the Green New Deal, seeing it as an example of how far left the Democratic Party has shifted, citing an FAQ from AOCs office that said that deal would make air travel obsolete and give economic security to those unwilling to work. It also spoke of getting rid of farting cows. Her office subsequently distanced itself from that FAQ, saying that it was published in error and was ""unfinished."" The deal failed in the Senate after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., put it up to a test vote, with dozens of Democrats voting present. I could not be more glad that the American people will have the opportunity to learn precisely where each one of their senators stand on the 'Green New Deal': a radical, top-down, socialist makeover of the entire U.S. economy, McConnell said ahead of the vote. In the conversation reported by the Post, Ricketts was reportedly uncertain about Chakrabartis statement.  Yeah, said Ricketts, before saying no. I think...its dual. It is both rising to the challenge that is existential around climate and it is building an economy that contains more prosperity. More sustainability in that prosperity  and more broadly shared prosperity, equitability and justice throughout. Chakrabarti reportedly praised Ricketts for his team's work in making a comprehensive plan, but then added: Ill be honest, my view is I still think you guys arent going big enough.",12/07/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aocs-top-aide-admits-green-new-deal-about-the-economy-not-the-climate
"74 trillion tons of fake snow over Antarctic could 'save coastal cities' from climate change, researchers say","Spraying trillions of tons of fake snow may sound like something cooked up by a novelist writing about the year 2150, but according to a new study, it could stave off global sea rise and protect coastal cities. This type of enormous feat of geoengineering would require energy from more than 12,000 wind turbines to provide power for massive seawater pumps and snow cannons, according to the researchers. However, scientists are not advocating that humanity take up this approach; instead, they note that its ""absurdity"" shows the dramatic threat facing the world from climate change-related sea level rise. A range of different studies have found that rising sea levels, impacted by the melting of glaciers and the changing climate, could imperil cities across the world in the latter half of this century and beyond. APOLLO 11: GOOGLE CREATES MOONLIGHT PORTRAIT LARGER THAN CENTRAL PARK TO HONOR MISSION YOUTUBE STAR'S DEATH PROMPTS AMAZON TO PUSH FOR E-SCOOTER SAFETY WARNINGS IN UK Although it's not known if the entire west Antarctic ice sheet will melt, the scientists have speculated that sea levels will rise based on what they were during previous much warmer periods. As scientists we feel it is our duty to inform society about every potential option to counter the problems ahead, Professor Anders Levermann, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who led the research, told The Guardian. As unbelievable as [the proposal] might seem, in order to prevent an unprecedented risk, humankind might have to make an unprecedented effort. The researchers' work uses computer models to determine how much water would have to be pumped from the ocean to the top of the ice sheet and then sprayed as snow to stabilize it. The study was published in the journal Science Advances. The gargantuan effort would require 74 trillion tons of water and would have a hefty price tag, as well. David Vaughan, director of science at the British Antarctic Survey and not part of the research, told the British publication: Scientists have an important role in testing, and challenging climate fixes. I think [Levermann and colleagues] tread the tightrope well, examining and challenging this idea without becoming advocates. Indeed, they are careful to point out the severe side effects.

Gillibrand unveils $10 trillion plan to combat climate change,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is pledging that if elected to the White House, shell spend $10 trillion over the next 10 years in both taxpayer dollars and private funding to tackle climate change and implement the goals of the Green New Deal. We have seen catastrophic flooding across the Midwest, damaging wildfires in California, and hurricanes ravage communities in the South and Puerto Rico. Many people have lost their homes and loved ones because weve failed to act on climate change, the senator from New York said in a Medium post Thursday morning. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON CLIMATE CHANGE BATTLE My plan lays out immediate and bold action to protect our communities and save our planet, Gillibrand touted. Not only would I enact the Green New Deal and protect clean air and clean water, but I will reinvest in the communities that have been most impacted by climate change and hold polluters accountable for the damage theyve caused the American people. As part of her proposal, Gillibrand vows to bring the nation to net-zero carbon and greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. To reach that goal, the senator calls for 100% clean, renewable, and zero-carbon electricity in a decade. And she would push for new standards for newly manufactured vehicles so as many as possible are zero-emission. Gillibrand also said shed issue an executive order to end all new fossil fuel leases on public lands or off-short on the nations outer continental shelf. Her plan also includes putting a price on carbon  starting at $52 per metric ton  to steer companies away from fossil fuels and towards clean and renewable energy alternatives, ending federal subsidies and tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, and spending $100 billion to help rural communities transition to clean energy Gillibrand argued that her price on carbon will help pay for her plan. The revenue generated from this carbon tax, estimated at more than $200 billion annually, will then go directly back into our countrys transition to renewable energy, she explained. The candidate also pledged that on day one of a Gillibrand administration, shed reverse Republican President Trumps move to take the U.S out of the Paris climate agreement, and she vowed to strengthen Clean Air Act regulations and reverse the Trump administrations moves on the Clean Water Act.

"Today's climate change is worse than anything Earth has experienced in the past 2,000 years","The global climate is changing faster now than it has at any point in the past 2,000 years. That's the conclusion of a trio of papers published July 24 in the journals Nature and Nature Geoscience that examined the global climate over the past two millennia. The researchers showed that none of the past fluctuations  that is, not the Little Ice Age, the warm period known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly or any other famous shift  had the global reach that modern climate change is having. Past fluctuations tended to be localized, affecting primarily one region at a time. Modern climate change, by contrast, is messing with the entire world. ""Temperatures did not rise and fall everywhere in step [in the past],"" editors wrote in an accompanying opinion piece in Nature Geoscience. ""Specifically, early cool or warm intervals that lasted for centuries peaked at different times in different regions."" That's a radical departure from modern climate change, Scott St. George, a climate researcher at the University of Minnesota who wasn't involved in the research, wrote in a news and views article for Nature.

"More than 200 reindeer found dead in Norway, starved by climate change","Researchers recently found more than 200 dead reindeer on the island of Svalbard in Norway; the animals starved to death due to climate change, which is disrupting their access to the plants that they typically eat. Every year, ecologists with the Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) survey reindeer populations in Svalbard, an archipelago of glaciers and frozen tundra that lies between Norway and the North Pole. The findings from the scientists' 10-week investigation were grim: Reindeer population numbers were down, and the individual animals were much thinner than they should have been. And hundreds of reindeer carcasses showed signs of starvation, Norway's national news outlet, NRK, reported on July 27. [6 Surprising Facts About Reindeer] ""It's scary to find so many dead animals,"" Ashild nvik Pedersen, an NPI terrestrial ecologist, told NRK. Reindeer in Svalbard are a subspecies, Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus, and they are short-legged, with endearingly small, rounded heads. Males are slightly larger than females, measuring about 5 feet (1.6 meters) long and weighing up to 198 lbs. (90 kilograms), according to NPI. Climate change is bringing warmer temperatures to Svalbard, which means more precipitation. And heavy rainfall in December is thought to be responsible for the unusually high number of reindeer deaths, the researchers wrote on May 28 on the NPI website. After the December rain hit the ground, the precipitation froze, creating ""tundra ice caps,"" a thick layer of ice that prevented reindeer from reaching vegetation in their usual winter grazing pastures. This forced the animals to dig pits in shoreline snow to find seaweed and kelp, which are less nutritious than the reindeer's usual fare. The scientists also observed reindeer grazing on cliffs, which the animals rarely do during winters when food is more plentiful. Rocky, mountainous regions on Svalbard don't have much plant life, and this ""mountain goat strategy"" is risky for the reindeer, because the cliffs are very steep. But during lean years, about 50% of the reindeer climb to altitudes of nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) in a desperate search for food, the researchers reported. With their pastures locked in ice, the reindeer also have to travel farther to find food. And when there is little to eat, the youngest and oldest animals are usually the first to die, Pedersen told NRK. ""Some of the mortality is natural because there were so many calves last year,"" she said. ""But the large number we see now is due to heavy rainfall, which is due to global warming.""

"German lawmakers consider 'meat tax' to combat climate change, improve animal welfare","Germany is floating the idea of steeply increasing taxation on meat in an effort to improve the environment and strengthen animal welfare. German lawmakers have suggested the taxation on meat, which has traditionally been subjected to a lower sales tax, as a means of tackling climate change. DENMARK CONSIDERS TAX ON BEEF, OTHER RED MEATS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE Im in favor of raising the VAT reduction and using it for greater animal protection, said Friedrich Ostendorf, a Greens spokesman on agricultural policy, the Local reported. Im in favor of raising the VAT reduction and using it for greater animal protection. Lawmakers say meat should be subjected to the standard value added tax (VAT) of 19 percent, rather than the current 7 percent. Ostendorf pointed out that theres no logic behind taxing meat less while other products such as oat milk is taxed by the standard rate. The tax increase was initially proposed by Germanys Animal Welfare Association that suggested such tax would bring down the CO2 emissions in addition to improving much-criticized agricultural practices of Germany. Parallel to the CO2 tax, we also need a meat tax, the groups president Thomas Schroder said, adding that meat, milk and eggs only cost a few cents per kilo, according to the outlet. Germany has approved a climate protection plan back in 2016, agreeing that by 2030, emissions in the agricultural sector should fall by 31 to 34 percent compared with 1990 levels. GERMAN CUSTOMS SEIZE 4.5 TONS OF COCAINE DISGUISED AS SOYBEANS, WORTH $1.1 BILLION But some politicians, including from the left-wing Social Democrats in Germany, have said that such tax would mostly affect the consumers rather than improve animal welfare standards. Lawmakers on the right, meanwhile, said the extra funds generated by the meat tax should go back to livestock industry directly to improve the conditions rather to the governments coffers. This additional income would have to be used as an animal welfare premium in order to support the livestock farmers in Germany during their restructuring. This additional income would have to be used as an animal welfare premium in order to support the livestock farmers in Germany during their restructuring, said Christian Democratic (CDU) agricultural politician Albert Stegemann, according to the Local. The road to socially sustainable livestock farming would cost billions of euros, which farmers in Germany would not be able to bear alone, he added. The German Farmers' Association has come out against the proposal, echoing Stegemanns criticism and saying the industry needs money to improve the standards.  It is not the tax authorities but farmers who need funds and support for the further development of animal husbandry, Bernhard Krusken, General Secretary of the association, said Wednesday.",07/08/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/world/german-lawmakers-meat-tax-climate-change-animal-welfare
UN climate report: Change land use to avoid a hungry future,"GENEVA (AP)  Human-caused climate change is dramatically degrading the Earth's land and the way people use the land is making global warming worse, a new United Nations scientific report says. That creates a vicious cycle which is already making food more expensive, scarcer and less nutritious. ""The cycle is accelerating,"" said NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig, a co-author of the report. ""The threat of climate change affecting people's food on their dinner table is increasing."" But if people change the way they eat, grow food and manage forests, it could help save the planet from a far warmer future, scientists said. Earth's land masses, which are only 30 percent of the globe, are warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole. While heat-trapping gases are causing problems in the atmosphere, the land has been less talked about as part of climate change. A special report, written by more than 100 scientists and unanimously approved by diplomats from nations around the world Thursday at a meeting in Geneva, proposed possible fixes and made more dire warnings. ""The way we use land is both part of the problem and also part of the solution,"" said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a French climate scientist who co-chairs one of the panel's working groups. ""Sustainable land management can help secure a future that is comfortable."" Scientists at Thursday's press conference emphasized both the seriousness of the problem and the need to make societal changes soon. ""We don't want a message of despair,"" said science panel official Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London. ""We want to get across the message that every action makes a difference."" Still the stark message hit home hard for some of the authors. ""I've lost a lot of sleep about what the science is saying. As a person, it's pretty scary,"" Koko Warner, a manager in the U.N. Climate Change secretariat who helped write a report chapter on risk management and decision-making, told The Associated Press after the report was presented at the World Meteorological Organization headquarters in Geneva. ""We need to act urgently."" The report said climate change already has worsened land degradation, caused deserts to grow, permafrost to thaw and made forests more vulnerable to drought, fire, pests and disease. That's happened even as much of the globe has gotten greener because of extra carbon dioxide in the air. Climate change has also added to the forces that have reduced the number of species on Earth. ""Climate change is really slamming the land,"" said World Resources Institute researcher Kelly Levin, who wasn't part of the study. And the future could be worse. ""The stability of food supply is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases,"" the report said. In the worst-case scenario, food security problems change from moderate to high risk with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now. They go from high to ""very high"" risk with just another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) of warming from now. ""The potential risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing,"" NASA's Rosenzweig said. ""Just to give examples, the crop yields were effected in Europe just in the last two weeks."" Scientists had long thought one of the few benefits of higher levels of carbon dioxide, the major heat-trapping gas, was that it made plants grow more and the world greener, Rosenzweig said. But numerous studies show that the high levels of carbon dioxide reduce protein and nutrients in many crops. For example, high levels of carbon in the air in experiments show wheat has 6 percent to 13 percent less protein, 4 percent to 7 percent less zinc and 5 percent to 8 percent less iron, she said. But better farming practices  such as no-till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer applications  have the potential to fight global warming too, reducing carbon pollution up to 18% of current emissions levels by 2050, the report said. If people change their diets, reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and seeds, the world can save as much as another 15% of current emissions by mid-century. It would also make people more healthy, Rosenzweig said. The science panel said they aren't telling people what to eat because that's a personal choice. Still, Hans-Otto Portner, a panel leader from Germany who said he lost weight and felt better after reducing his meat consumption, told a reporter that if she ate less ribs and more vegetables ""that's a good decision and you will help the planet reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" Reducing food waste can fight climate change even more. The report said that between 2010 and 2016, global food waste accounted for 8 percent to 10 percent of heat-trapping emissions. ""Currently [25 percent to 30 percent] of total food produced is lost or wasted,"" the report said. Fixing that would free up millions of square miles of land. With just another 0.9 degrees F of warming (0.5 degrees C), which could happen in the next 10 to 30 years, the risk of unstable food supplies, wildfire damage, thawing permafrost and water shortages in dry areas ""are projected to be high,"" the report said. At another 1.8 degrees F of warming (1 degree C) from now, which could happen in about 50 years, it said those risks ""are projected to be very high."" Most scenarios predict the world's tropical regions will have ""unprecedented climatic conditions by the mid-to-late 21st century,"" the report noted. Agriculture and forestry together account for about 23 percent of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the Earth, slightly less than from cars, trucks, boats and planes. Add in transporting food, energy costs, packaging and that grows to 37 percent, the report said. But the land is also a great carbon ""sink,"" which sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air. From about 2007 to 2016, agriculture and forestry every year put 5.7 billion tons (5.2 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air, but pulled 12.3 billion tons (11.2 billion metric tons) of it out. ""This additional gift from nature is limited. It's not going to continue forever,"" said study co-author Luis Verchot, a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia. ""If we continue to degrade ecosystems, if we continue to convert natural ecosystems, we continue to deforest and we continue to destroy our soils, we're going to lose this natural subsidy."" Overall land emissions are increasing, especially because of cutting down forests in the Amazon in places such as Brazil, Colombia and Peru, Verchot said. Recent forest management changes in Brazil ""contradicts all the messages that are coming out of the report,"" Portner said. Saying ""our current way of living and our economic system risks our future and the future of our children,"" Germany's environment minister, Svenja Schulze, questioned whether it makes sense for a country like Germany to import large amounts of soy from Latin America, where forests are being destroyed to plant the crop, to feed unsustainable numbers of livestock in Germany. ""We ought to recognize that we have profound limits on the amount of land available and we have to be careful about how we utilize it,"" said Stanford University environmental sciences chief Chris Field, who wasn't part of the report.",08/08/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/science/un-climate-report-change-land-use-to-avoid-a-hungry-future
Al Gore claims his climate-change predictions about 2016 have now come true,"Former Vice President Al Gore said his predictions from 2006 about climate change over the next ten years have come true and claimed part of the damage has been irreversible. ""You said back in 2006 that the world would reach the point of no return if drastic measures weren't taken to reduce greenhouse gases by 2016. Is it already too late?"" ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked during ""This Week with George Stephanopolous"" on Sunday. ""Well, some changes, unfortunately, have already been locked in place,"" Gore replied. ""Sea level increases are going to continue no matter what we do now. But, we can prevent much larger sea level increases -- much more rapid increases in temperatures. The heat wave was in Europe. Now, its in the Arctic, and were seeing huge melting of the ice there.""

""So, the warnings of the scientists 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, unfortunately, were accurate,"" he said. ""Heres the good news... In the Democratic contest for the presidential nomination this year, virtually all of the candidates are agreed that this is either the top issue or one of the top two issues.""  ""Theres both bad news and good news. The problem's getting worse faster than we are mobilizing to solve it,"" Gore added. ""However, theres also good news.

Bernie Sanders: Climate change poses a bigger threat to America than ISIS,"2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said climate change represents a bigger threat to national security than ISIS or Al Qaeda, during a campaign speech in Des Moines, Iowa, Sunday. ""Four years ago I came here to Iowa and I was asked what is the major national security issue we face? And people thought Id say ISIS or Al Qaeda, and those are big issues. The answer that I gave, in terms of national security, is climate change,"" Sanders said as the crowd cheered. Sanders has been an outspoken advocate of government intervention to combat climate change but also spent nearly $300,000 on private air travel in October 2018. BERNIE SANDERS CLAIMS 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' WILL SLASH HEALTH CARE COSTS WITH TAX HIKE Sanders 2018 campaign committee paid $297,685 on October 10 to New York-based Apollo Jets, a charter jet company used by famous sports stars, according to federal campaign reports obtained by VTDigger.org, a watchdog website in Vermont. This expense was for transportation for the senators nine-day, nine-state tour to support Democratic candidates up and down the ballot ahead of Election Day, said Arianna Jones, senior communications adviser for Friends of Bernie Sanders. Sanders also called President Trump an ""idiot"" on Twitter Saturday for being skeptical of climate change. ""Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot,"" he wrote.

Rick Perry: Democrats living 'in a fantasy world' with climate change rhetoric,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Tuesday that Democrats are living in a ""fantasy world"" when it comes to their climate change rhetoric and accused them of twisting the truth to help bolster their political talking points. Perry was responding on ""America's Newsroom"" to 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who said climate change was a bigger threat to national security than ISIS or Al Qaeda while campaigning in Iowa on Sunday. ""I think they live in a fantasy world. The reality is that the United States is lowering emissions -- one of the only countries in the world,"" the former Texas governor said. ""I think about all the 194 [countries] that signed onto the Paris accord, the U.S. is the one that's leading the world in reducing emissions... America [is] transitioning away from old inefficient power plants to natural gas plants."" Perry added, ""Maybe they think, they being the Democrats that are running for president, that China would be a better place for all of this manufacturing to occur. It is fantastical when you think about the true misrepresentation of the truth that the Democrats are spewing out there."" AL GORE CLAIMS HIS CLIMATE CHANGE PREDICTIONS ABOUT 2016 HAVE NOW COME TRUE  He also claimed the federal government is exploring new ways to reduce harmful emissions and said Democrats are trying to bury the truth because it conflicts with their political rhetoric. ""We are addressing it. I think that's one of the things that the... media needs to take a second look at, what's going on. I'm leaving here from Pittsburgh headed to... our national energy technology lab, where we're seeing that type of technology being developed to reduce emissions -- to come up with the technologies and innovation,"" he said. ""Fifteen years ago people told us that we'd found all the oil and gas that there was. There was no more. Innovation changed that -- whether it's hydraulic fracturing, directional drilling. And now natural gas is replacing a lot of those old inefficient plants and we're driving down emissions. That's the story that the Democrats don't want to talk about because it doesn't meet their narrative of going out and trying to scare the American public into potentially voting for them. I don't think the American people are going to be fooled by that rhetoric."" Perry spoke ahead of his visit with President Trump to Shells soon-to-be-completed Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, which critics have said will be a major air polluter. The plant will turn natural gas deposits into plastics, though critics have called out the harmful environmental effects of plastics. Perry said the world must address the issue of plastics polluting oceans, but products made up of polyethylene are used widely, including for wind turbines, solar panels, heart valves and auto parts. ""You can't have it both ways,"" Perry said, ""and the Democrats are trying to.""",13/08/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-democrats-climate-change-bernie-sanders-aoc
"Climate change will shrink 'virtually all' economies around the globe by 2100, study warns","Plastic pollution found in the world's oceans and the melting permafrost in the Arctic could have startling economic burdens, perhaps as much as $2.5 trillion and $70 trillion, respectively. And while there may have been some hope that certain countries could escape the brunt of the impact, a new study suggests that ""virtually all"" nations will be negatively affected by climate change by 2100. The study, circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research, suggests that countries that are warm, cold, rich or poor will all see a significant loss of income if they do not abide by the 2015 Paris Agreement. ""Using a panel data set of 174 countries over the years 1960 to 2014, we find that per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by persistent changes in the temperature above or below its historical norm, but we do not obtain any statistically significant effects for changes in precipitation,"" the study's abstract states. ""Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04C per year, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by 7.22 percent by 2100."" PLASTIC POLLUTION IN WORLDS' OCEANS COULD HAVE $2.5 TRILLION IMPACT, STUDY SAYS The impact on the U.S.   which accounted for much of the research's focus to compare economic activity in hot or wet areas  would be even greater, a loss of 10.5 percent of its GDP by 2100, according to the researchers. ""Whether cold snaps or heat waves, droughts, floods or natural disasters, all deviations of climate conditions from their historical norms have adverse economic effects,"" said Dr. Kamiar Mohaddes, a co-author of the study from Cambridge's Faculty of Economics, in a statement. The researchers looked at ten different sectors, including manufacturing, services, retail and wholesale trade across the contiguous 48 states and found that all of them suffered from at least one aspect of climate change  heat, flood, drought or freeze. ""By concentrating on the U.S., we were able to compare whether economic activity in hot or wet areas responds to temperature fluctuations around historical norms in the same way as that in cold or dry areas within a single large nation,"" Mohaddes added. UN REPORT WARNS COMING 'CLIMATE APARTHEID' WILL SPLIT EARTH BETWEEN 'THOSE WHO ESCAPE' AND 'THOSE WHO WILL SUFFER' ""Without mitigation and adaptation policies, many countries are likely to experience sustained temperature increases relative to historical norms and suffer major income losses as a result,"" Mohaddes said. This holds for both rich and poor countries as well as hot and cold regions."" Canada was also specifically mentioned, as Mohaddes said the country is ""warming up twice as fast as rest of the world"" and there are risks to its physical infrastructure, coastal and northern communities, as well as human health and wellness, ecosystems and fisheries."" The country's economy would decline by 13 percent, according to the report. MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THINK CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CAUSE HUMANITY'S EXTINCTION  Other countries, such as Japan, Switzerland and Russia, would also see outsized declines. The economies of these countries would decline 10 percent, 12 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Although the researchers acknowledge that world economies will change and adapt to the shifting climate, it may not be enough. According to scientific consensus, it takes roughly 30 years to adapt to climate change, from altering infrastructure to cultural practices. But if that timeframe were sped up to 20 years, the U.S. would still lose 7 percent of its GDP by the end of the century. ""The U.K. recently had its hottest day on record. Train tracks buckled, roads melted, and thousands were stranded because it was out of the norm,"" Mohaddes said. ""Such events take an economic toll, and will only become more frequent and severe without policies to address the threats of climate change."" Although the report may seem dour about the prospects of the global economy, not all hope is lost, especially if countries abide by the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Abiding by the non-binding agreement would limit the temperature increase to just 0.01 degrees Celsius, which would only cut world real GDP per capita by 1.07 percent.  A previous version of this story said that the study was published by the National Economic Bureau of Research. Instead, it was circulated by the organization.

Democratic voters in New Hampshire blame climate change for economic woes,"GREENFIELD, N.H.  The 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls flocking to the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire could encounter voters who say they are feeling the effects of climate change in their pocketbooks -- as they seek to woo Democrats who count the environment as a top issue. Tourism is the Granite States second-largest industry and accounts for a large portion of the states economy. The ski industry alone contributes on average about half a billion dollars a year to the state, but its been forced to make some changes over the years to combat a rise in winter temperatures -- an average increase of nearly six degrees since 1970. Were a climate-sensitive industry...we rely on cold winters and cold weather,"" Ski New Hampshire president Jessyca Keeler told Fox News. ""We did a four-year study looking at the economic impact of the ski industry in the state of New Hampshire...we can see the impacts of climate change on our operations."" OCASIO-CORTEZ, SANDERS CALL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION, SEEKS A RE-DO OF FAILED GREEN NEW DEAL Ski resorts have experienced environmental changes like higher temperatures and shorter ski seasons, forcing them to use snow guns to keep skiers mobile on the slopes with artificial product and potentially harming industries that profit off of winter activities. They have also started offering summer activities like obstacle courses and ziplining to mitigate economic losses across the ski industry during slow winter seasons. The rural beauty of our area is what brings people here, said New Hampshire Democratic voter Dani Shaw. So its very important that in areas that rely on tourism that we put our best foot forward."" Shaw added: ""We are a beautiful state. Keeler says the losses cause a ripple effect. If we're not doing as well that's not just impacting us, that's impacting whole areas because you're going to probably see less employment or people getting laid off...you're going to see restaurants, retail shops not doing as well. It's not just the ski industry, it impacts entire communities, she said. A recent CNN poll ranks climate change and the environment second only to healthcare among the most important issues to Democratic voters in the Granite State, an indication of how the topic is playing a prominent role early in the 2020 contest. Democratic candidates -- and voters -- have called on the Democratic National Committee to hold a debate dedicated exclusively to climate change. Officials voted down a resolution calling for the debate Thursday, but did move forward an effort to create a climate change council within the Democratic party. There really should be a debate just on climate change because theres a physical, a social and an economic impact, said George Hablen, the chairman of the Plaistow, N.H. Democrats. Meanwhile, the hot-button topic doesn't rank in the top six most important issues to the state's Republican voters. Republicans have accused Democrats of over-hyping the threat -- and have vehemently pushed back against the ""Green New Deal"" proposal embraced by progressives, pointing in part to the price tag  estimated to be about $7 trillion -- and saying it would hurt business. ""I think Republicans are concerned about the environment...but the words climate change or global warming have become politicized...it shows this dichotomy of the country where such an issue like climate change, which could possibly be front and center, is another issue where the country splits and divides,"" said New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque.  The views on climate change may vary depending on state and party affiliation, but one thing is clear: if candidates want to win over savvy Democratic voters in New Hampshire, they need to talk about climate change and the environment. As the states February primary nears, Levesque says candidates will continue to push the issue even harder to garner support in a state thats influence can prove powerful in close election years. New Hampshire has a long tradition of sort of taking a hard look at front runners and switching things up a little bit, and I think that the candidates here in New Hampshire know that, and that's why they're campaigning so hard here, said Levesque. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders often discusses the subject at his campaign rallies -- diving into his views on climate change, environmental protections and the fossil fuel industry -- while entrepreneur Andrew Yang chose the coastal town of Portsmouth, N.H. to roll out his climate policy proposal next week. Sanders today unveiled his Green New Deal policy proposal, which calls for the U.S. to reach 100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transportation by no later than 2030 and complete decarbonization by 2050."" During a recent stop in Des Moines, Iowa, Sanders also said climate change represents more of an immediate threat to U.S. national security than terrorist attacks by ISIS or Al Qaeda. BERNIE SANDERS: CLIMATE CHANGE POSES A BIGGER THREAT TO AMERICA THAN ISIS ""People across the state really value the natural beauty that we have here...that is something that people do care about and that I think people recognize that that's what makes New Hampshire special, Keeler said.",22/08/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-hampshire-democrats-climate-change-economy
Protests erupt after DNC puts kibosh on climate change-focused debate,"The Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in San Francisco erupted into a hail of protests on Thursday, as unruly environmentalist activists condemned the party's decision not to hold a presidential primary debate focused exclusively on climate change  a demand long sought by left-wing activists. The San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the environmentalist group Sunrise Movement posted a video of dozens of its members chanting the union hymn, ""Which Side Are You On?"" after the DNC's resolutions committee voted 17-8 not to have a climate-focused debate. Some boisterous demonstrators seemingly struggled to remember more than the song's refrain, as others chanted, ""They say in Harlan County there are no neutrals there. You'll either be a union man, or a thug for J. H. Blair."" ""This is a terribly frightening, existential crisis that demands a different course of action,"" said Muriel MacDonald, an organizer for the Sunrise Movement in the Bay Area. ""If we play by the old rules, we are going to suffer terribly."" DEM SOCIALISTS' CONVENTION DESCENDS INTO CHAOS, AS DELEGATES COMPLAIN OF 'SENSORY OVERLOAD,' 'GENDERED LANGUAGE' AND 'AGGRESSIVE SCENTS' After the group stormed out, Symone Sanders, a senior advisor to presidential candidate Joe Biden, wrote on Twitter that a key sticking point was whether to have a climate change debate, as opposed to a less confrontational climate change forum. ""I said what do we tell folks who have also asked for debates and were told no and had to have forums?"" Sanders wrote. ""I named checked womens repro groups, black women, Latinx, BLM and more."" Sanders rejected a claim by the Sunrise Movement that he was ""trying to shut down the movement for a #ClimateDebate right now at the meeting. But her boss [Joe Biden] has publicly supported it multiple times. So...whats going on?"" WATCH: TOP DEM SENATOR SCOLDS KIDS PUSHING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, TELLS WHIPPERSNAPPERS, 'I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING' Amid all the infighting, a DNC official, speaking to protesters, suggested that some compromise remained possible. Sunrise Bay Area separately quoted a DNC member as saying, You have friends in there and were going to go for a floor vote in the #climatedebate resolution...were not giving up. There are people here fighting. We have your back."" DNC chairman Tom Perez has stuck by his earlier decision not to hold ""single-issue"" debates, instead planning at least a dozen debates, six in 2019 and at least six in 2020, in partnership with television networks. The third of that series is set for Sept. 12 and potentially Sept. 13 if enough candidates qualify. Perez has argued that he wants the broadest audiences possible to see Democratic candidates discuss a wide range of issues. His aides also note that the party has received separate requests for single-issue debates on civil rights, guns, poverty and issues affecting older Americans. Additionally, the party has barred its candidates from attending any non-DNC sponsored debate, which the chairman defines as candidates interacting on the same stage at the same time. However, the party's Resolution Committee on Thursday did adopt a statement that encourages candidates to participate in unofficial ""multicandidate"" forums with candidates on the same stage. That could, however, meet Perez's definition of a ""debate,"" and thus run afoul of existing rules barring candidates from such events not sanctioned by the party. In a statement, Sunrise Movement called the day a ""partial victory for young climate organizers nationwide,"" because ""after months of campaigning,"" the resolutions committee had reversed a ban on presidential candidates participating side-by-side in ""non-DNC sanctioned events to discuss the climate crisis."" BERKELEY SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE EMERGENCY IS BASICALLY JUST LIKE WORLD WAR II But activists have long sought an official DNC-sanctioned climate-change debate. In an embarrassing blunder, dozens of Sunrise Movement protesters recently staged a sit-in protest at what they believed to be a Pennsylvania Democratic Party office lobby to demand the party organize such a debate. Police arrested 11 individuals, and it later emerged there was no Democratic Party office there. The environmentalists said they had received bad information. ""If you can't figure out where the local Democratic Party offices are before you show up for the protest, I'm not sure that I trust your analysis of the climate science much less what to actually do about the problem,"" Ted Nordhaus, founder and executive director of The Breakthrough Institute, told Reuters. Nevertheless, despite all the setbacks, on Thursday the group sounded a note of optimism, and vowed to continue to push for that goal. ""This partial victory shows the strength of the grassroots movement and the power of young people,"" said Sunrise Movement spokesperson Sofie Karasek. ""In the coming days and months, we'll keep fighting to make sure the DNC and Tom Perez treat the climate crisis like the emergency that it is, and give it the airtime and attention it deserves."" However, political headwinds appeared to be running against the environmental activists. The bedlam came a day after Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who made climate change the center issue of his campaign, announced he was ""withdrawing"" from the 2020 presidential race, as the Democrat said ""it's become clear"" he didn't have a shot at winning the primary. The environmental activist had urged the DNC to host a debate centered exclusively on climate change  only to fail to qualify to meet polling thresholds needed to attend the party's upcoming regularly scheduled debate in Houston, as well as a CNN town hall in New York dedicated to global warming. ""People will try to spin it differently but Inslee's lackluster performance is an obviously bearish indicator for the prioritization of climate change in Democratic politics,"" analyst Nate Silver aid Wednesday. ""Inslee, who could never improve on ~1% in the polls despite an intense focus on climate change, is a datapoint against the proposition that Democrats' votes are deeply motivated by policy concerns,"" he added. At the same time, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders released a $16.3 trillion climate plan earlier this month, that expanded the Green New Deal. Sanders pushed for renewable energy across the economy by 2050 and sought an official declaration that climate change poses a national emergency. Sanders described the plan as a ""ten-year, nationwide mobilization centered on equity and humanity."" For his part, President Trump has said the Green New Deal would ""crush the poor."" The EPA, Trump said last month, has seen success by retooling and working on more practical solutions, including by issuing more ""Superfund"" grants to clean up polluted sites. A United Nations report on climate change warned late last year that the world will face several consequences from climate change  extreme drought, food shortages and deadly flooding  unless theres an unprecedented effort made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Then, last November, the Trump administration released a federal report that found that the impacts of climate change are being felt across the country, and extreme weather and climate-related events are going to worsen in the years to come  with a significant possible impact on the economy by the end of the century. Some conservative commentators have argued that most proposed solutions would do more harm than good, and also have accused climate activists of sacrificing their credibility by crying wolf. In 2006, a NASA scientist and leading global warming researcher declared that the world had only 10 years to avert a climate catastrophe  a deadline that has come and gone. A senior U.N. environmental official warned similarly all the way back in 1989 that ""entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.""

DNC rebuffs push for unofficial climate change-focused presidential 'debates',"The Democratic National Committee voted down a resolution at its summer meeting in San Francisco Saturday that would have freed the party's presidential candidates to participate in unofficial multi-candidate forums focused solely on climate change. The national party committee voted 222-137 against a resolution that would have encouraged candidates to essentially disregard a rule set by DNC Chairman Tom Perez that barred them from appearing on the same stage at the same time during so-called ""non-party events."" The vote drew a rebuke from left-wing environmental activists, such as the Sunrise Movement, who say the party leadership is ignoring young voters' priorities. PROTESTS ERUPT AFTER DNC PUTS KIBOSH ON CLIMATE CHANGE-FOCUSED DEBATE ""The Democratic Party needs the energy and motivation of young people to win in 2020,"" said Evan Weber, Sunrise Movement political director. ""The energy around this issue has been incredibly clear, yet Tom Perez keeps shooting the party in the foot by rejecting that energy and turning it away."" Similar protests broke out Thursday when the DNC's resolutions committee voted 17-8 against holding single-issue debates. Perez has said throughout the primary campaign that he opposes making any of the party's official debates revolve around a single issue. Perez said this week that he wants the widest possible audiences for primetime debates, with voters getting to see candidates address a full range of issues. The next official Democratic debate is scheduled for Sept. 12 in Houston, with a second night of debates scheduled for Sept. 13 if enough candidates can qualify. WATCH: TOP DEM SENATOR SCOLDS KIDS PUSHING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, TELLS WHIPPERSNAPPERS, 'I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING' Perez has encouraged candidates to participate in issue-specific forums that don't involve multiple candidates being on the same stage together. CNN, for example, has planned a climate forum in September, with at least 10 candidates expected to appear individually and discuss climate policy in-depth. Powerful organizations such as the National Education Association and the AFL-CIO already have hosted such events focused on their policy priorities. Perez aides also noted this week that he's gotten requests from different interest groups requesting full-fledged debates on civil rights, guns, poverty and issues affecting older Americans. GET THE FOX NEWS APP The wrangling this week came in the wake of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ending his presidential bid that he'd hinged on a pledge to make climate action the nation's top priority. Inslee was able to attract more than 130,000 individual donors  the mark the DNC set as one qualifying metric for the September debate stage. But Inslee was well shy of an additional requirement to hit 2% support in at least four national or early nominating state polls from reputable pollsters. Inslee had repeatedly called on Perez to dedicate a DNC-sponsored debate to climate action.",24/08/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dnc-presidential-candidates-climate-change-debate
"Liz Peek: Democrats diss young voters on climate change, opening door for a third party candidate","Democrats may have just clobbered their chances of victory in 2020. While all eyes were trained on President Donald Trumps furious confrontation with China last week, Democrat officials at their partys convention in San Francisco again voted down a resolution calling for a candidate debate on climate change. That could prove a dire error. The decision to prevent a climate debate will almost certainly encourage a third-party candidate. And that candidate could sabotage Democrats chances of retaking the White House. Who might it be? It could be former Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who ran to highlight climate change but recently withdrew from the Democratic nomination race. Or maybe a billionaire like Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg, who both similarly want to press Democrats to focus on global warming. They might not expect to win, but their campaigns could elevate the climate discussion. MANDY GUNASEKARA: US AIR IS CLEANEST ON RECORD  TRUMP IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY  Remember that the Green Party put Jill Stein forward in 2016. Though few took Steins candidacy seriously, in the end she attracted 1.4 million votes. In the aftermath of the election, some blamed her for Hillary Clintons loss, pointing out that in the critical swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, Trumps margin of victory was less than the number of votes won by Stein. Since 2016, the climate issue has taken center stage in Democrats platforms, becoming especially important to young voters who are playing a growing role in our elections. A Pew Center survey reports that voters under the age of 53 cast 62.2 million votes in the 2018 midterm elections, more than the 60.1 million recorded by people 53 and older. In the midterm contest, Gen Z and millennials made up 25 percent of the total votes cast; their share will increase in 2020. Young voters are energized, and especially about global warming. A Harvard Kennedy School survey found climate change to be the third most important issue to voters under 30, behind immigration and the economy. The decision to prevent a climate debate will almost certainly encourage a third-party candidate. And that candidate could sabotage Democrats chances of retaking the White House. For proof of the importance of young climate enthusiasts, look no further than the Sunrise Movement, an activist group begun only two years ago that has attracted tens of thousands of followers and staged protests in 250 cities around the country. It also takes credit for launching the Green New Deal, which, though widely mocked on the right, has been embraced by nearly every Democratic senator running for 2020. Sunrise representatives in attendance at the San Francisco convention erupted after the DNC vote to block a climate debate, chanting Failure of leadership and we cant wait to protest the complicity of DNC Chair Tom Perez in the decision; many stormed out of the meeting. Their anger was echoed on social media. Elizabeth Warren tweeted: Climate change is an existential threat that threatens (sic) all of us....Thats why we need to have a #ClimateDebate. Al Gore chimed in, tweeting: The Democrats decision to sabotage a #ClimateDebate is extremely disappointing. Voters all over the U.S. are demanding we focus on the biggest threat to our nation and humanitys future and prioritize solving the climate crisis instead of continuing business as usual. The hashtag #ClimateDebate trended on twitter in the wake of the vote, with nearly every Democrat hopeful weighing in. Climate warriors Greenpeace participated, tweeting We just got word that the DNC voted to block a #climatedebate. We cant begin to tell you how outraged we are... Our political system is failing us, and its failing a whole generation of people fighting for a better world. Blocking a climate debate was risky for Perez and other Democratic Party officials. They must have known the decision would infuriate young voters, but they also recognized that such a forum could trip up their candidates. They knew that their over-the-top remedies to stem global warming might turn off much-needed independents, guaranteeing Trumps reelection. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Consider Bernie Sanders most recent plan to combat rising emissions, which is projected to cost $16 trillion. In a recent interview, even MSNBCs liberal Chris Hayes sounded anxious about the scope of Sanders proposal, which he described as really large. He asked how Sanders would pay for such a mammoth overhaul, which includes replacing every old diesel school bus, replacing old mobile homes in the country, in addition to a federal takeover of the whole thing, that's essentially a Tennessee Valley Authority extension for the whole country... In a rambling response, Sanders explained that his program will be paid for with the money the federal government will make producing sustainable energy (though wind and power production still require subsidies), the elimination of massive tax breaks now given to fossil fuel companies, the taxes received from the 20 million new good-paying union jobs sure to be created, cuts to military spending, and higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Time does not allow a thorough debunking of this proposal, except to note that green activist group Oil Change International estimates the subsidies given to oil and coal producers at $20 billion annually, that the taxes that might be collected on 20 million union workers earning $100,000 apiece would be about $340 million, and that a 50 percent hike in the individual income taxes paid by every American would yield only about $1 trillion. In other words, the numbers dont add up. Bernie is not alone, of course. Beto ORourke has laid out a $5 trillion plan, and Elizabeth Warren has not one but five climate proposals in the hopper. Joe Biden has put forward a plan that only costs $1.7 trillion, earning him a C+ grade from the liberal scolds at Mother Jones. And lets not forget the Green New Deal, estimated to cost north of $50 trillion.  Perez and the Democrat machine are in a tight spot. Either allow Sanders and his rivals to alienate moderate voters by pushing programs that cost the moon, or risk providing a platform for a third party green candidate who can mobilize young voters. On the other hand, the debate could prove illuminating. In the MSNBC interview, Bernie starts off admitting, Well, the first thing is we cannot not afford it. Bernie is confused and confusing.

Andrew Yang proposes 'giant space mirrors' to tackle climate change,"Presidential candidate Andrew Yang's climate plan aims to get the U.S. to net-zero carbon emissions with a range of new initiatives -- including investing in major geoengineering projects like giant mirrors in space. Like many of his fellow Democratic presidential candidates, Yang has proposed using a wide range of tools to ramp up renewable energy, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, establish new standards on emissions for buildings, cars and the entire electric grid, and boost nuclear energy capacity. However, his 20-year, $4.87 trillion climate plan differs in one way, and that's in terms of geoengineering -- the notion that humans should take deliberate and large-scale action concerning climate in order to stop or slow down the planet's warming. Yang's plan would provide $800 million to NASA, the Department of Defense and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to research geoengineering, which includes investigating ""giant foldable space mirrors"" as an emergency measure of last resort. AMAZON FIRES: WHY IS THE RAINFOREST BURNING? ""Space mirrors would involve launching giant foldable mirrors into space that would deploy and reflect much of the suns light [away from the planet]. This method would be extremely expensive, which is why it should be investigated as a last resort. However, since we would be able to undo the mirror after deployment if needed, its less permanent,"" Yang has written. The entrepreneur proposed that America become a global leader in green technology. ""Were the most entrepreneurial country in the history of the world.

Ocasio-Cortez warns that melting glaciers could release ancient diseases,"Climate change could unleash a variety of diseases that the modern world is unprepared to deal with, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., claimed on Tuesday. The freshman congresswoman -- and architect of the ambitious ""Green New Deal"" -- took to Instagram to express how worried she is about the specter of climate change. During a live video session, she argued that warming would melt glaciers and create the potential for new diseases infecting human populations. ""Scientists fear that there's a potential that a lot of diseases could escape these melted glaciers, things that were frozen for thousands of years, and that theyre going to get into our water,"" she said, ""and that humans could contract them, and they are going to be diseases that are thousands of years old that have vectors that we are not prepared for, that we have never seen."" AOC MOCKS TRUMP OVER TWEET CALLING ELECTORAL COLLEGE A 'DISASTER': 'I AGREE!' She added that even if glaciers didn't release diseases, climate change would lead to more mosquitoes that could increase the spread of other infections. Ocasio-Cortez has made headlines since taking office in part by pushing bold policy proposals that many deemed unrealistic. During her Tuesday video, she suggested the U.S. had no choice but to take drastic action on climate change. The alternative to large-scale solutions, the New Yorker said, was higher costs and people dying from climate change's impact. ""We need to start getting comfortable with how extreme the problem is,"" she said, ""because only until we accept ... how bad climate change is and how bad it can be for our children's lives, are we going to be comfortable pursuing really big solutions."" The ""Green New Deal"" seeks to reach net-zero carbon emissions within just decades -- something conservative studies have said would entail astronomical costs.  ""We're not trying to end cows and plane travel, but we need to change our lives,"" she said.

Thats exactly what Ill do as president, Booker said in a statement. The plan includes an array of executive actions, such as taking on companies that pollute with increased EPA enforcement, requiring all new passenger vehicles to have zero emissions by 2030, and imposing a ban on all new fossil fuel leases. Booker also intends to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and revoke orders from President Trump to approve the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines. Additionally, Booker wants to push Congress to create a United States Environmental Justice Fund, which would commit $50 billion a year to advance environmental justice and invest in communities long left behind. Goals include replacing lead drinking water service lines in residences, schools, and daycares; cleaning abandoned uranium, coal, and hard rock mines; and planting 100 million trees in urban areas that Booker's plan says suffer disproportionately from air pollution.  The plan sets a goal of 2045 for achieving a completely carbon-neutral economy through investments in clean energy such as wind and solar, and a next-generation smart grid. Bookers plan joins other costly proposals put forth by fellow Democratic candidates. Former Vice President Joe Biden has proposed a Clean Energy Revolution that would involve $1.7 trillion in federal investments and additional private sector and state and local investments of more than $5 trillion.

Marlo Lewis: Climate questions for politicians (that no one seems to want to ask),"The Democrats running for their partys presidential nomination are focusing more on climate change. Here are five questions reporters should ask to test whether the candidates climate policies deserve the support of the American people. In fact, these are questions that should be asked of all politicians who advocate climate policies, regardless of their party affiliation. 1. Would your climate policies trigger a recession? With 10-year Treasury bond yields continuing to fall relative to two-year bond yields, and 30-year bond yields hitting an all-time low, many market analysts worry the economy is heading towards a recession. However, a recent Bloomberg News article notes that consumer confidence in August hit an all-time high, and a major reason is low oil prices. As the story explains: Few things get consumers to pull back like rising gasoline prices. DOUG SCHOEN: SHRINKING FIELD OF DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IS BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP  HERES WHY Indeed, every downturn since 1970 has been preceded by a doubling of oil prices the prior 12 months that has pressured consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy. Oil prices are low because the U.S. energy companies are producing at record levels. Climate policies such as the Green New Deal aim to ban offshore drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and fossil fuel exports and imports, plus massively raise taxes on oil industry investors. Such policies would quickly bankrupt industries that keep consumer confidence high by keeping energy prices low. What is the risk that the energy price shocks from your plan to suppress oil and gas production would push the economy into a recession? 2. Would your climate policies put U.S. households in economic peril?  Several recent reports find that the Green New Deal would impose massive costs on U.S. households. For example, a Competitive Enterprise Institute/Power the Future study estimates that Green New Deal energy policies would cost an average household in Pennsylvania $72,000 in the first year of the program, $45,000 annually in the second through fifth years, and $38,000 in year six and later. Would the Green New Deal put millions of American households in the poorhouse? 3. Do the benefits of your climate policy justify the costs? Assuming mainstream climate science modeling, eliminating all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow would avert only 0.034C0.062C of global warming in 2050. Such a tiny change, which is too small to be reliably detected, would have no discernible effect on weather patterns, crop yields, or polar bear populations. The Green New Deal would have even less impact on global temperatures. How do such vanishingly small climate benefits justify the enormous costs? 4. Will you acknowledge the serious methodology and transparency problems in the U.S. National Climate Assessment and fix them? The recent National Climate Assessment generated headlines when it claimed global warming could reach 8C (14F) and lop 10 percent off U.S. GDP by centurys end. However, to get that alarming result, the assessment ran an ensemble of models that on average project twice as much warming over the past 40 years as actually occurred. Worse, the modelers used an inflated emissions scenario in which coal scales up rapidly to provide nearly half of all global energy by 2100  a percentage not seen since 1940. Even with that biased combo, warming hits 8C in only 1 percent of model projections  a detail the assessment failed to mention. If elected, will you fix the National Climate Assessment so that it informs rather than propagandizes the public about climate change? 5. Is there really a climate crisis? In the United States, there has been no increase in flood magnitudes in any region since the 1920s, and no nationwide increase in drought since 1900 as measured by the Palmer Drought Severity Index. There has been no trend since 1900 in the strength or frequency of U.S. land-falling hurricanes, and none in hurricane-related damages once losses are adjusted for increases in population, wealth, and the consumer price index. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Globally, the total area burned by wildfires has decreased every decade since the 1940s, and NASA reports that the number of square kilometers burned fell by about 25 percent between 2003 and 2019. In addition, all major indicators of human health and well-being such as life expectancy, per capita income, and crop yields have improved dramatically during the era of global warming. Finally, whatever effects global warming may be having on the weather since the 1920s, the individual risk of dying from extreme weather globally has decreased by 99 percent, and since 1990, the relative economic impact of extreme weather (measured as a percent of global GDP) has declined.  What is your real-world evidence that climate change is a crisis? Politicians proposing multitrillion-dollar climate plans owe it to the American people to answer tough questions, rather than relying on claims of consensus and smearing those who disagree in an attempt to dodge them.",04/09/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/marlo-lewis-climate-questions-for-democrats-that-no-one-seems-to-want-to-ask
Rich Powell: Dems want to fight climate change in all the wrong ways ??Here?? what they should support,"When it comes to the worlds changing climate, many Democrats have been wearing blinders. If youve been paying attention to what the Democratic presidential candidates are saying on climate, make sure you look for the big picture. Yes, climate change is real, and industrial activity is contributing to it. Economic impacts are clearly rising. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration finds that the five-year running average of damage of weather events has risen over the past 20 years from $20 billion a year to $100 billion a year. But too often, liberal Democrats assume socialist command and control approaches  mixed with federal jobs guarantees and universal health care  are the only solutions. AOC SAYS SHE'S WOKEN UP AT 3:30 AM BECAUSE OF HER ANXIETY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE The Democrats point out that global carbon dioxide emissions have increased to record highs and rightly discuss the urgent need to reverse the trend. But where are their realistic solutions? As Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who serves on the House Energy Committee, has written, we want Americas innovators to develop the next technologies that will improve the environment and create jobs here at home. Here are five critical pieces the Democratic presidential candidates have been ignoring that Republicans havent missed. Natural gas While the Democratic candidates are correct on the urgency of the problem of climate change, they haven't acknowledged whats actually reduced the carbon emissions most. The reductions have come about because of the natural gas revolution right here in the United States, which has lowered our power prices and cut grid emissions by 20 percent. Future gas technologies hold even more promise. Look at NET Power, a North Carolina company working on an emissions-free natural gas power plant as a $150 million proof-of-concept facility. The development of similar clean fossil fuel technologies would be supported by a bill in Congress called the Launching Energy Advancement through Innovations in Natural Gas (LEADING Act). Nuclear energy Democrats ignore or downplay the most important source of zero-emission energy in the U.S.  nuclear power, or as I call it, the global clean energy workhorse. Nuclear power produces carbon-free energy 24/7 and is incredibly resilient in the face of increasing natural disasters. During Hurricane Harvey, a Texas nuclear power plant continued to operate at full throttle for 2 million customers, despite 130 mph gusts outside its front door. The presidential candidates could support bipartisan policies like the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act. Such policies support new nuclear power plant designs that could be used in military bases, heavy industry and the civilian grid. Unfortunately, several of the top candidates turn up their nose to nuclear power. Hydropower While they talk a lot about renewables, the Democratic presidential candidates ignore the renewable resource-producing enough clean electricity to power more than 20 million homes in America  hydropower. It's clean, affordable and can be counted on for backup power. These benefits make hydro the fourth-largest electricity source after natural gas, coal and nuclear power. Although hydropower is one of the most affordable ways to make and store electricity, since the 1960s the stream of hydropower development gradually slowed to a trickle. Heres a free hint to the candidates  talk about fixing hydropowers bureaucratic licensing process, because it can take more than a decade, driving up costs on prospective developers. Economic leakage We don't hear about the problem known as ""leakage."" If we impose expensive regulations on our industries to reduce emissions  and those industries dont have low-cost emissions control technologies, or cleaner alternatives, ready to deploy  they are encouraged to move production abroad to places with less strict emissions controls. This could simply shift manufacturing abroad without a global emissions benefit. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Developing more affordable clean technologies would help prevent leakage. We pioneered the first wave of clean energy technologies, including the first solar cell, hydroelectric facility and nuclear power plant. We can do it again. Developing countries Lastly, the Democrats rarely talk about the insatiable energy appetite in the developing world. After all, the U.S. is now only 15 percent of the global emissions problem. As population and economies grow in developing regions, they are demanding more and more affordable energy options. The current energy choices available to developing nations are less than desirable for the climate. Since 2000, coal power in China has nearly quadrupled. Chinas plans include new coal plants roughly equal the size of the entire U.S. coal fleet, and financing billions of dollars worth of inefficient coal power plants outside Chinas borders.  We could debate the merits of a socialist Green New Deal takeover of the entire U.S. economy  a debate destined to go nowhere.

CNN analyst claims melting ice caps will leave US cities 'engulfed in floods',"CNN political analyst David Gergen said Wednesday that action to counter climate change has become a ""moral imperative"" as Hurricane Dorian inched its way up the East Coast. During a discussion of a recent trip to Greenland on ""CNN Newsroom,"" Gergen claimed U.S. cities should prepare for massive flooding if polar ice caps continue to melt.  ""I went [to Greenland] thinking it was a practical imperative to deal with climate change. I came away feeling its a moral imperative,"" he said. ""When you see whats happening in Greenland, it is an early -- it's an early set of signals about whats going to happen to the globe.""  AOC SAYS SHE'S WOKEN UP AT 3:30 AM BECAUSE OF HER ANXIETY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ""The glaciers are retreating, they're breaking off and forming icebergs,"" he continued. ""Theyre beautiful icebergs, but theyre breaking up. There is a growing danger that the icecap will melt in Greenland and well have -- there wont be a big icecap in the summer... We could have cities in the United States engulfed in floods."" Gergen isn't the only public figure sounding the alarm on climate change. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., recently claimed she has woken up in the middle of the night due to her fears about the climate and tried to link climate change to Hurricane Dorian.  ""This is what climate change looks like: it hits vulnerable communities first,"" she tweeted Tuesday in accompaniment to a video of Dorian's devastation in the Bahamas. ""I can already hear climate deniers screeching: ""Its always been like this! Youre dim,"" etc. No. This is about science &amp; leadership. We either decarbonize&amp;cut emissions, or we dont &amp; let people die.""   Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also weighed in on ""Fox News Sunday"" when he was asked if he thought climate change had any effect on the strength of recent hurricanes.  ""We know the climate's changing and we know our storms seem to be getting bigger,"" he said. "" ...

Trump trolls 'FakeNewsCNN' climate forum with list of facts he says network will omit,"President Trump attempted to get ahead of Wednesday's CNN Democratic climate forum by posting a list of things he predicted would not make it on the air. Trump claimed that the United States had the largest carbon emissions reduction, highlighted China's role in emitting carbon, and claimed none of America is exposed to air pollution levels above those suggested by the World Health Organization. The town hall event is slated to last for seven hours, although that wasn't enough for CNN's chief climate correspondent. BERNIE SANDERS: CLIMATE CHANGE POSES A BIGGER THREAT TO AMERICA THAN ISIS ""There was so much cry out from those voters who will caucus for Democrats or independents who put this topic at the very top of their concern list,"" CNN's Bill Weir said. ""And many were calling for a dedicated climate debate with all 10 on stage. The DNC didnt go for that for whatever reason. And so we thought: 'Why don't make it happen?'"" He continued: ""Look, Im biased. I think we could do a town hall a day on this and it wouldnt be enough to cover it because its everything. Its everything in our lives, from energy to politics to geopolitics to psychology to history."" Climate change has become a key issue in the 2020 presidential cycle as Democratic candidates have issued dire warnings about its impact and pushed massive policy proposals for dealing with the issue. ""The Democrats destructive 'environmental' proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump,"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday. ""Don't the Democrats care about fighting American poverty?"" CNN'S CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT SAYS NETWORK'S 7-HOUR CLIMATE CHANGE TOWN HALL ISN'T ENOUGH He went on to blast the Paris Climate Agreement, from which the president withdrew the U.S. in 2017. ""The badly flawed Paris Climate Agreement protects the polluters, hurts Americans, and cost a fortune. NOT ON MY WATCH!"" Trump tweeted. Leading Democratic candidates have vowed to rejoin the agreement as part of proposals that they say will prevent large-scale damage from climate change. ""The cost of inaction is unacceptable,"" the campaign for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., claimed. ""Economists estimate that if we do not take action, we will lose $34.5 trillion in economic activity by the end of the century. And the benefits are enormous: by taking bold and decisive action, we will save $2.9 trillion over 10 years, $21 trillion over 30 years, and $70.4 trillion over 80 years.""  But the field's plans, many of which endorse the ""Green New Deal"" (GND), could inflict a heavy financial toll if conservative groups' estimates prove true. The right-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute concluded that the GND would cost the average household at least $70,000 in the first year of its rollout, and a cool $250,000 dollars after five years. The Heritage Foundation predicted that reaching just a portion of the GND's emissions reductions goal would cost $15 trillion in gross domestic product. Fox News' Joseph A.

Tucker challenges Dems' climate change rhetoric: 'They're hypocrites and liars',"Following increased coverage of climate change in the wake of Hurricane Dorian, Fox News host Tucker Carlson challenged his Democratic guest to defend his environmental views Wednesday, and openly laughed at his response before calling it ""insane."" Carlson was interviewing former Clinton adviser Richard Goodstein and asked him if spending trillions of dollars on a climate change initiative was a sound investment. ""[I'll] actually cite a Republican, Dick Cheney, who had the 1 percent doctrine which is if there is a 1 percent chance that a threat is going to effectuate, we have to treat it as a certainty,"" Goodstein replied. Carlson laughed at the answer and said no one who supports climate change legislation uses facts to prove their claims. Instead, he said, they rely on emotion and intimidation. ""The basic precept of science is, don't tell me. Show me. Prove it,"" he said. ""And no one bothers to do that. instead they throw slogans at you. They attack you. Nobody doubts the climate changes. It always has changed. The question is, is man causing it and can we stop it?"" Goodstein claimed the economy would drastically shrink if climate change was not addressed by the federal government. Carlson said it would be illogical to spend 80 percent of America's GDP on a politically driven climate plan. ""I wasnt a math major at Harvard,"" he said, ""but you're saying that worst-case scenario, climate change reduces the size of the U.S. economy by 10 percent by the end of the century. Bernie Sanders is proposing to spend 80 percent of the entire U.S. economy every year. How does this work?"" Goodstein shot back: ""By the end of this century the U.S. economy will be about $100 trillion, not what it is now."" Carlson replied: ""We don't know what the U.S. economy will look like at the end of the century. That's insane."" He also chastized climate change advocates for preaching against consumption while using private planes for personal travel. ""If you really believe this, that this was such a massive existential problem, that you would take up the whole U.S. Economy to fight it, why the hell are you flying on private planes, seriously?"" he asked. TUCKER CARLSON SAYS TRUMP 'DOMINATED' KIM AS 'WHEEZING' NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR STRUGGLED CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Goodstein refused to answer the question, prompting Carlson to call the climate change movement hypocritical.

'The future seems so bleak' : 'The Five' react to climate change plans proposed by Dems on CNN,"""The Five"" co-hosts reacted to Wednesday's marathon CNN climate change town hall event Thursday, during which many of the Democratic presidential candidates took what some argued were extreme environmental positions. ""I believe the president would also like to thank CNN for asking some of these frontrunners specific questions which they actually answered,"" co-host Jesse Watters said before listing some of the positions taken by candidates. Those positions ranged from Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., pledging to ban plastic straws to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., saying he'd he would support taxpayer-funded programs to administer abortions in developing countries as well as give women access to birth control to deal with population growth. Watters blasted CNN and the candidates, saying it was ""crazy"" that population control was raised during the event. KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE SUPPORTS PLASTIC STRAW BAN DURING CNN CLIMATE CHANGE MARATHON ""The answers were stupid and the questions were amazing for the Republicans and everybody should thank CNN,"" Watters said. ""The fact that they actually got on there and said 'population control' is crazy. That's what they do in communist China."" Co-host and comedian Michael Loftus also agreed with Watters, pointing out that Democrats had a bleak outlook for the future. ""The future seems so bleak. Like, could it sound any worse?"" Loftus said. ""Well, we all need to be vegetarians living like it's World War II, drinking out of straws that don't work.""

"Mattis turns up heat on climate change deniers, pushes for more federal action on 'national security issue'","Former Defense Secretary James Mattis had a message for climate change skeptics on Thursday, warning that it was a ""national security issue."" He was responding to MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell, who had asked about the U.S. Navy's decision to end an Obama-era task force on climate change. Mattis declined to address that specific program, but said he believed climate change was a ""reality"" that presented a host of dangers. His comments followed days of reports on Mattis' view of Trump and his disagreement with the president's decision to withdraw from Syria. Although Mattis described Trump as an ""unusual president,"" he refused to ""speak ill"" of him during an interview with CBS. Thursday, without mentioning Trump specifically, Mattis suggested to Mitchell that skeptics should want some kind of ""insurance policy"" against climate change. MATTIS REFUSES TO 'SPEAK ILL' OF TRUMP IN INTERVIEW, BUT CALLS HIM 'UNUSUAL PRESIDENT' ""For those who are adamant there is no climate change -- you look at the receding sea ice and have different explanations -- why wouldn't we take out an insurance policy and do prudent steps to make certain the generation that's coming up is not going to be caught flat-footed by this?"" Mattis asked. He went on to call the issue a matter of ""national security,"" claiming that natural disasters created refugee flows, a need for humanitarian assistance, and opportunities for terrorists to recruit vulnerable populations. At the start of 2019, the Defense Department released a report describing ""the effects of a changing climate"" as a ""national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense ... missions, operational plans, and installations."" The Trump administration attracted scrutiny for the president's statements on the issue and for rolling back former President Barack Obama's policies with the Environmental Protection Agency.

Appearing on Americas Newsroom with co-host Sandra Smith, Gunasekara said that climate change is an important issue, but she didn't agree that it's an existential threat to humanity as Democrats assert. On Thursday, CNN held a seven-hour town hall on climate change with some of the 2020 presidential candidates, covering a range of topics from clean energy solutions to the high cost of some Green New Deal variants.

Buttigieg invokes God while discussing climate change: He'd think pollution is 'messed up',"South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg invoked religion while discussing climate change during CNN's marathon town hall on Wednesday.

Daniel Turner: Winners and losers from Democrats' climate change town hall,"CNN devoted about seven hours to a series of town halls on climate change Wednesday night, giving 10 candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination the chance to discuss their wish-lists of extraordinarily expensive environmental proposals they would seek to enact if they make it to the White House. The biggest winner of the night wasnt even on stage. It was President Trump, who has brought the American people massive job creation, a stronger economy, lower taxes and a booming energy sector that has put us on the road to energy independence. I predict that millions of voters who learned about the Democrats energy plans will have no choice but to turn to Trump to avoid the disaster those plans would bring. BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HE'D BACK US FUNDING FOR THIRD WORLD ABORTIONS, BIRTH CONTROL AS PART OF CLIMATE PLAN Another winner on Wednesday night was renewable energy, which was supported by all the Democratic candidates at the town halls  Former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; businessman Andrew Yang; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto ORourke of Texas; and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. And there were two big losers of the night. First, science. It was replaced by magical thinking on the part of the 10 Democratic candidates, who believe they can translate the hopes and dreams of environmental zealots into reality. The other big loser was the American people  who have no choice on the Democratic side for a candidate who advocates sound environmental policies based on reality that will not cripple our economy and throw millions of people out of work. All of the candidates promised green jobs. All of them claimed their policies will create opportunities across America. But future promises pale in comparison to reality. Under President Trump we have record-high employment and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. We have cheap energy  compared to the green energy in Europe where people pay three and four times much as we do utility costs. Our abundant fossil fuels mean that despite hurricanes and Iranian hostility, gasoline prices remained very low even at the height of summer. Democrats embrace a doomsday clock ticking to 2030  saying we must get off fossil fuels by then. This is a constant fearmongering tactic that Americans are tired of. We arent ready to surrender our jobs, our steaks, our cars, our air-conditioning and heat for a socialist power grab. Americans want to be winners. The Green New Deal, climate hysteria and all 10 candidates cannot make Americans believe what science, math and history show to be true. While its true that the green energy the Democratic candidates embrace holds a lot of potential and has a bright future years from now, all of the candidates ignored a few inconvenient truths, if I may borrow a phrase for former Vice President Al Gore. First, keep in mind that the president of the United States is not a dictator. Many of the proposals by the Democratic candidates are sure to run into resistance by Republicans and even many Democrats in Congress. So just because a new president says he or she wants to take certain actions to fight climate change doesnt mean Congress will authorize and fund them. Second, green technology is completely sustained by tax subsidies, and cannot survive in the marketplace without them. The candidates glossed over how to raise the trillions of dollars needed to fund these subsidies  a critical problem with various versions of the Green New Deal and even less ambitious programs. Its like saying youd like to buy a $20 million mansion for your family  and will worry later about how to pay for it. We have to face the facts: There arent enough millionaires and billionaires  the group demonized by so many of the Democratic candidates  to pick up the tab for the green revolution the presidential hopefuls want to fund. The green revolution would require massive tax increases on all of us  taking a lot of green out of our wallets and crippling consumer spending that fuels our economy and creates jobs. The candidates and moderators also completely ignored the fact that green technology is not at all green. It requires tremendous amounts of fossil fuels, and particularly the most targeted: coal. Coal forges steel  900 tons of which is required for each wind turbine. Coal is the main ingredient in concrete  2,500 tons of which is required to anchor each wind turbines. In other words, without coal we do not have wind power. The other panacea of the greener tomorrow is electric vehicles. Teslas, like all electric vehicles, are reliant on enormous tax subsidies to make them affordable to consumers. And it is curious, maybe even unfair, that at the same time, taxpayers provide thousands of dollars to purchase these cars, Teslas founder has become a multibillionaire without incurring the wrath of any candidate. And Teslas, just like all electric vehicles, need to be forged with steel. Which requires coal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Electric vehicles also require tremendous amounts of rare earth elements, most of which are not found in America, requiring China to play ball. If we force consumers to only buy electric vehicles, we are basically building Chinas economy  just like we did when we moved manufacturing out of the Rust Belt. On top of this, while electric vehicles dont emit carbon dioxide, many power plants producing electricity run on fossil fuels. Replacing all those power plants would be an enormously expensive undertaking. And many Democrats oppose a massive turn to nuclear power, which emits no carbon dioxide but faces opposition because of safety concerns and concerns about disposing of atomic waste. Finally, another loser in the very long night of political spin was Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, who lost his battle to keep a climate debate out of the Democratic primary process.  The American people are on a figurative first date with the 2020 presidential candidates right now. You never want to show your crazy side on a first date. After the long night of the Democratic environmental talkfest, we should be skeptical about another date with any of these candidates.

The heavily promoted, seven-hour event ran from 5 p.m. EST until midnight and featured 10 Democratic presidential hopefuls discussing their plans to combat climate change. CNN averaged 1.1 million viewers during the event, compared to 1.7 million for liberal rival MSNBC while Fox News averaged 2.5 million viewers over the same time period with regular programming. CNN also finished last during the primetime hours of 8-11 p.m. EST.

"Buttigieg says those who eat burgers, use plastic straws are 'part of the problem' on climate change","If you eat hamburgers or use plastic drinking straws, consider yourself part of the climate change problem. That was the assessment of Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Thursday during an appearance on CNNs ""New Day."" Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind.,  told host Alisyn Camerota he thinks many people view climate issues from ""the perspective of guilt."" ""You know, from using a straw to eating a burger. Am I part of the problem? In a certain way, yes,"" he said. ""But the most exciting thing is that we can all be part of the solution."" BUTTIGIEG INVOKES GOD WHILE DISCUSSING CLIMATE CHANGE: HE'D THINK POLLUTION IS 'MESSED UP' Buttigieg said part of his climate-change proposal involves motivating the public. ""I think the downside to us facing just how colossal of a challenge this is, is it can feel paralyzing,"" Buttigieg said. ""But we can rise to meet this and be proud of it. That's part of what my climate plan is about. It's not only about all of the things we've got to do technologically and with regulation and so on. It's about summoning the energies of this country to do something unbelievably hard. ""If you look at the moments when this country rose to a major challenge, overcoming the Great Depression, winning World War II, going to the moon, it required something out of all of us. And I think we could be standing taller,"" he continued. Buttigieg made his remarks a day after he and other Democrats running for president discussed plans to combat climate change during a CNN town hall telecast Wednesday. During the town hall, the 2020 hopeful claimed climate change was a national security issue and that the Syrian war was the first war partly caused by climate change. He also invoked God and religion in the climate change debate, saying environmentally irresponsible behavior was kind of a sin.

"Tucker Carlson: CNN's town hall was not really about climate change, but about Dems controlling our lives","It was an act, really, of wanton cruelty committed against defenseless television viewers. On Wednesday night, CNN subjected its tiny audience to what it described as a ""Climate Change Town Hall."" The thing went on for seven hours. That's a long time. In fact, that's so long that climate predictions made at the start of the evening could have been proven wrong by the end. An entire species of polar bear might have become extinct by the third commercial break. It's a long time, And yet, in the name of science, a few hearty souls attempted to watch the entire thing. Now, we can't say with certainty what happened to them -- though, of course, they're in our prayers. But at least one of them could be seen lapsing into total unconsciousness while Elizabeth Warren was answering a question. CNN'S MARATHON TOWN HALL ON CLIMATE CHANGE FINISHES BEHIND FOX NEWS, MSNBC He was the lucky one. If he was sleeping deeply enough, he might have missed CNN asking Democratic presidential hopeful Julian Castro what his administration would do to fight ""environmental racism."" We're not making that up. But that's just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg. Though it was billed as a show about the environment, in fact, Wednesday night was really an exercise in sweaty moral posturing. At times the evening became so strident that even the candidates on stage couldn't keep up with it all. Cory Booker, for example, tried to reassure viewers that Democrats don't really want to take people's meat away. Apparently, he had forgotten that Kamala Harris had just called for that. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER ""I hear about it all the time. 'Booker wants to take away your hamburger,"" he said. ""Well, that is the kind of lies and fear-mongering that they spread out there, that somehow the Democrats want to get rid of hamburgers."" But earlier in the night, Kamala Harris said the following in this exchange. Erin Burnett, CNN host: But would you support changing the dietary guidelines? Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., 2020 presidential candidate: Yes. Burnett: You know, the food pyramid. Harris: Yes. Burnett: To reduce red meat specifically? Harris: Yes, I would. So Kamala Harris had been thinking a lot about what you eat, and she thinks you eat too much red meat, and she plans to do something about it once she is elected God. That and a number of other things. In fact, there are quite a few things in America that Kamala Harris plans to ban immediately, as she indicated at the town hall. Jessie Bluedown, climate change activist: Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? Harris: There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking, so yes. Burnett: So would you ban offshore drilling? Harris: Yes, and I've again, worked on that. Burnett: Plastic straws are a big thing right now -- Harris: Yes -- Burnett: Do you ban plastic straws? Harris: I think we should, yes. Banning drinking straws. I mean, it is mindless and annoying. If you actually cared about plastic pollution -- and you should care about plastic pollution because it's horrifying  -- you would punish China for Chinese plastics in the ocean. But of course, no one on the left wants to do that because they're busy sucking up to China. Though it was billed as a show about the environment, in fact, Wednesday night was really an exercise in sweaty moral posturing. But banning fracking? Now, that's just demented. Our energy sector is the single most successful part of the entire American economy. It's one of the only things propping up our trade balance right now. It's been a savior of last resort for rural areas devastated by globalization. Kamala Harris doesn't care about any of that. She probably doesn't even know. When you're a soulless demagogue bent on acquiring power at all cost, details are not relevant. All you see is yourself at the finish line, arms in the air. Ambition is a powerful drug, and yet if we're being honest about it, Harris was not even close to the least appealing candidate on the stage Wednesday night. That award goes, without question, to Father Pete Buttigieg, the Patron Saint of South Bend, Indiana. Father Buttigieg launched into a sermon Wednesday night that would have made Jonathan Edwards proud. Sinners in the hands of an angry climate God. ""You know, if you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air of creation, and people are being harmed by it, countries are at risk of vanishing in low-lying areas, what do you suppose God thinks of that?"" Buttigieg asked. "" I bet he thinks it's messed up. At least one way of talking about this is that it's a kind of sin."" You shudder to think of the torments waiting for you in Father Pete's Episcopalian version of hell. Imagine him lecturing you superciliously for eternity, wagging his little fingers in your face, bragging about his virtue. It's enough to make you want to obey. Father Pete, though fears no such judgment. At the very same time he is yelling at you about ""belching poison into the air of creation,"" Father Pete himself is likely to be sipping Perrier at 50,000 feet in the leased Gulfstream. According to an Associated Press report, Buttigieg flies on climate-destroying private jets more than any other Democratic candidate in the race right now. How can that be? We asked the Buttigieg campaign that question, and they responded, ""We fly commercial as often as possible and only fly non-commercial when the schedule dictates."" Non-commercial -- oh that makes sense. The schedule dictates it. So when it's convenient, Father Buttigieg follows his own commandments. The rest of the time  -- when the schedule dictates -- he is happy to belch poison into the air of creation. So you're not allowed to drink from a plastic straw -- that's immoral. But Father Pete gets to keep his private plane. So, no wonder rich people love climate activism. For them, it's all upside. It's not so great for everyone else, unfortunately. For poor people in the third world, it's going to be especially tough. We're not going to be allowed to have as many children as they would like. Bernie Sanders explained it this way at the CNN Climate Change Town Hall. Martha Readyoff, treacher: Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe? Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 2020 presidential candidate: Well, Martha, the answer is yes. And the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions. And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control to me is totally absurd. Oh, there you go. Sanders says it right out loud. The Africans are having too many babies, we're going to have to make sure those Africans have more abortions. We're going to pay for African abortions.  We're also, by the way, going to have to control what people eat, how they travel and where, what they do for a living. We're going to have control every detail of their formerly personal lives. We're in charge, now, of everything. That's the message. I suddenly realize that none of this has much to do with the environment. Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Sept. 5, 2019.

Swedish scientist floats eating human flesh as solution to global climate change: reports,"A Swedish scientist speaking at Stockholm summit last week offered an unusual possible tactic in combating global climate change: eating human flesh. Stockholm School of Economics professor and researcher Magnus Soderlund reportedly said he believes eating human meat, derived from dead bodies, might be able to help save the human race if only a world society were to awaken the idea. Soderlunds argument for human cannibalism was front and center during a panel talk called Can you Imagine Eating Human Flesh? at the Gastro Summit, reports The Epoch Times. Conservative taboos against cannibalism, he said, can change over time if peoples simply tried eating human flesh. Some of the talking points at the seminar included whether humans were too selfish to live sustainably and if cannibalism is the solution to food sustainability in the future. MISTRIAL DECLARED IN CASE OF INDIANA MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING EX-GIRLFRIEND, EATING HER BODY PARTS When asked during an interview after his talk if he personally would try human flesh, Soderlund said he was open to the idea. ""I feel somewhat hesitant but to not appear overly conservative...Id have to say....Id be open to at least tasting it, he told Swedens TV4. He suggested more plausible options such as eating pets and insects. Before human meat becomes the next cuisine trend, however, history shows there are potential health risks to cannibalism.  A tribe in Papua New Guinea practiced eating their dead as an alternative to allowing them to be consumed by worms, according to the Standard. The cultural practice led to an epidemic of a disease called Kuru, also known as laughing death. According to the US National Library of Medicine, the disease is caused by an infectious protein found in contaminated human brain tissue. The practice of cannibalism among the people of New Guinea came to an end in 1960.",09/09/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/world/swedish-scientist-eat-human-flesh-climate-change
Liz Peek: Ignorance and silliness on display as Democrats race down climate change rabbit hole,"Hurricane Dorian has claimed another victim: victory for Democrats in 2020. Last weeks marathon CNN climate forum makes it clear: Dorian blew what remained of Democrat common sense right off the map. Ask yourself, is Elizabeth Warren smart to promise shell ban fracking, when Democrats are desperate to win Pennsylvania in 2020, and the Marcellus fracking play has produced hundreds of thousands of jobs and tens of billions in income for the state? ANDY PUZDER: AUGUST JOBS REPORT SHOWED A STRONG ECONOMY  AND THAT'S VERY BAD FOR DEMOCRATS Does Beto ORourke have a future in Texas after vowing to eliminate all fossil fuels, when oil and gas taxes sustain the states enviable growth and even a cushy rainy day fund? While there are numerous tripwires threatening Democrats eager to retake the Oval Office in 2020  no-limit abortions, open borders, wealth confiscation  these are nothing compared to the sheer nonsense trotted out during last weeks seven-hour climate open house. CNNs marathon event was catnip to Democrat presidential candidates eager to woo climate-addled millennials with trillion-dollar remedies to prevent the earths warming. Bernie Sanders wants poor women in other countries to abort their babies, Andrew Yang wants to take away our gas-powered vehicles, Kamala Harris wants to change our diet (even though California is the fourth-largest cattle-producing state). The marathon climate forum makes it clear: Dorian blew what remained of Democrat common sense right off the map. Really, its kooky stuff, all meant to bring home just how BIG a problem this is. A problem that ORourke, among others, describes as an existential threat to mankind. It doesnt get bigger than that. Beto, who can often be counted on for comic relief, related telling his son that the family would move to Washington, D.C., in the unlikely event of his election (he may not have framed it exactly that way)  because thats where the White House is and because, after all, El Paso was going to quickly become uninhabitable thanks to global warming. (Note the earth has warmed, according to NASA, approximately 0.15 to 0.20 degrees per decade since 1975; Betos sons grandkids will be just fine living in El Paso.) Both Beto and Pete Buttagieg likened our battle against climate change to fighting World War II, in which more than 400,000 Americans lost their lives, which pretty much sums up the ignorance revealed on the CNN platform. Some of the candidates seemed alert to the silliness of it all. Harris, asked if we should get rid of plastic straws, responded with less then full-throated enthusiasm, and then got profoundly giggly as she described the difficulties of drinking from paper alternatives. She swiftly shut it down, realizing that not a single person in the room considered plastic straws a laughing matter. Harris impulse is correct; straws are a footnote, estimated to compose about 4 percent of the volume of plastic waste going into our oceans. Because they weigh so little, their contribution to this type of trash is, by my calculation, 0.02 percent of the 9 million tons of refuse deposited each year. If you really want to clean up the oceans, which is an excellent goal, how about getting rid of plastic bottles? That would make a real difference, but would mean a far bigger battle, since it involves a far bigger industry. And, it might offend those thirsty millennials whose major contribution to fighting climate change so far has been the introduction of the ever-present water bottle. A more productive approach would be to encourage and fund research on how to reuse or dissolve plastics. That might mean working with Dow Chemical, a major plastics producer, which has initiated a $1 billion multi-firm effort aimed at developing new technologies and recycling efforts in order to reduce plastic waste going into the oceans. But, that would mean having an open mind and a practical purpose. When Sanders and Warren screech about greedy corporations, it makes it a little harder to engage those interests as partners. In any event, Democrats dont want partners, they want enemies, knowing that anger is one of the biggest boosters to voter turnout. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The ferocity of Hurricane Dorian fed the recent hysteria, of course, with zealots warning that big-weather events are more frequent today than in the past, thanks to global warming. It isnt true. The incidence of hurricanes has not increased in modern times; we are just keeping better track. An analysis by scientists working with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, a contributor to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveals that based on careful examination of the Atlantic tropical storm database (HURDAT) and on estimates of how many storms were likely missed in the past, it is likely that the increase in Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane frequency in HURDAT since the late-1800s is primarily due to improved monitoring. Though the last few years have seen a number of powerful storms, the average number of landfalls in the U.S. each year between 2006 through 2015 was a record low for any decade going back to 1850. Of the years suffering the most major hurricanes, only one has occurred in the past two decades since 2000; the worst ever was 1950. But, facts dont matter. Anyone who questions Sanderss claim that, Hurricane Dorian has everything to do with climate change, which is the existential threat of our time is written off as a denier. Anyone who wants to continue eating cheeseburgers is a Neanderthal and if you think that natural gas has been essential to our countrys reduced emissions in recent years, youre an idiot.  Democrats want to own climate change; they are convinced that their hyperventilation will win over millennial voters, an increasingly large share of the electorate. Republicans, and even many Democrats, are skeptical of spending tens of trillions of dollars to reshape our economy, knowing it will drastically raise energy costs, eliminate a huge geopolitical advantage, and throw millions out of work. Common-sense Americans wont buy it, either. As Democrats tumble down the climate change rabbit hole, they may find the price of owning climate change is extremely high indeed.

Andy Puzder: Here's why Dems want to generate climate panic (as they ignore ways to reduce carbon emissions),"Whether you accept or reject the climate change narrative, most people agree that we should avoid pouring massive amounts of anything with potentially harmful consequences into the atmosphere. There is scientific evidence that excessive levels of carbon in the atmosphere could adversely impact our climate  and we are emitting a lot of carbon. What interests me is that the politicians issuing the loudest warnings about catastrophic climate change are the same people who vigorously oppose the most practical and effective means of combating it. AOC SAYS SHE'S WOKEN UP AT 3:30 A.M. BECAUSE OF HER ANXIETY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE According to BPs 2019 Statistical Review of World Energy, an energy economics publication, global carbon emissions grew about 2 percent in 2018 to 33,890.8 million metric tons, due primarily to increased demand for heating and cooling services. While U.S. carbon emissions also increased in 2018, the U.S. has been the worlds leader in reducing carbon emissions for over a decade. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, carbon emissions in this country declined 14 percent between 2005 and 2017, mainly because more electricity has been generated from natural gas  a more efficient and less carbon-intensive fuel than either coal or petroleum. The EIA is forecasting a 2.2 percent decline in U.S. carbon emissions in 2019 as natural gas continues to replace coal in generating electricity.  Fortunately, we have natural gas in abundance, thanks to a private sector-developed extraction process known as fracking. Fracking does release methane gas, but according to the Environmental Protection Agencys 2018 Greenhouse Gas Inventory, released in April 2019, U.S. methane emissions declined 15.8 percent between 1990 and 2017, while natural gas production increased by 51 percent. More energy, less methane and carbon.  Sounds like progress. Nonetheless, virtually every Democratic presidential candidate who participated in CNNs recent seven-hour climate change marathon opposes fracking. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, said she would ban fracking  everywhere on her first day as president, a mandate that would undoubtedly increase our carbon emissions.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., never one to rigidly tether his policies to reality, would ban fracking on all public and private lands. In any event, reducing the worlds carbon emissions is not something any American president alone can achieve.  While U.S. emissions are significant and should be reduced, they constitute only 15.2 percent of the worlds total. China emitted 27.8 percent, or 9,428.7 million metric tons, of carbon in 2018. Thats more than the U.S. (5,145.2 million) and the European Union (4,248.4 million) combined. To reduce emissions we need plausible alternatives. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are currently incapable of meeting the world's energy demands on their own. As respected environmentalist and former renewables advocate Michael Shallenberger explains in a piece in Quillette magazine titled ""Why Renewables Cant Save the Planet,"" both wind and solar currently lack the capacity to generate or store sufficient energy to meet global demand. Hydroelectric and geothermal energy production are limited geographically.  With current technology, renewables alone simply are not a viable alternative. Instead, Shallenberger has become an advocate of nuclear energy  a safe and inexpensive means of significantly reducing carbon emissions. Nuclear energy already cleanly supplies over 10 percent of the worlds electricity and, according to a February 2019 report from the World Nuclear Association, almost all reports ""on future energy supply from major organizations suggest an increasing role for nuclear power as an environmentally benign way of producing reliable electricity on a large scale. Clearly, certain Democrats are more determined to scare us into accepting socialism than in reducing carbon emissions. Otherwise, why reject effective solutions that we know will reduce  and are today reducing  carbon emissions without reversing the incredible progress we have made since the Industrial Revolution in reducing extreme poverty, hunger and infant mortality - increasing life expectancy and improving standards of living to the highest levels in human history. In fact, its difficult to take anyone seriously who rails against increased carbon emissions but either refuses to consider nuclear power as part of the mix (Sanders), opposes building new reactors (former vice president Joe Biden), or declines to take a position on nuclear energy (Warren). Opposing not only natural gas but also nuclear energy raises the question of what Democrats are actually trying to accomplish under the guise of climate change. There have been some clues. Saikat Chakrabarti, New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezs former chief of staff, admitted in July that the true motivation behind the Green New Deal wasnt a climate thing.  It was a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing,  he said. That helps explain why progressives are attempting to generate climate panic while opposing practical means for reducing carbon emissions. It also explains why they favor massive tax increases, excessively burdensome regulation and spending virtually incomprehensible sums on far less effective,  if not ineffective, approaches. Clearly, certain Democrats are more determined to scare us into accepting socialism than in reducing carbon emissions.  Otherwise, why reject effective solutions that we know will reduce  and are today reducing  carbon emissions without reversing the incredible progress we have made since the Industrial Revolution in reducing extreme poverty, hunger and infant mortality --  increasing life expectancy and improving standards of living to the highest levels in human history. We have the means to reduce carbon emissions without rendering ourselves subservient to a class of government elites, surrendering our freedoms, or destroying our economy  despite the lefts continuing attempts to scare us into serfdom.

AOC appears to claim Miami will be gone 'in a few years' because of climate change,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appeared to make another stark prediction about climate change this week, suggesting an entire city would vanish within ""a few years."" Ocasio-Cortez was touting her ""Green New Deal"" program at a NAACP forum Wednesday when she addressed critics who have called her plans ""not realistic."" ""What is not realistic is not responding to the crisis -- not responding with a solution on the scale of the crisis,"" she said. ""Because what's not realistic is Miami not existing in a few years. That's not realistic. So, we need to be realistic about the problem."" AOC ACCUSED OF SOVIET-STYLE PROPAGANDA WITH GREEN NEW DEAL 'ART SERIES' In a video last month, Ocasio-Cortez said the alternative to large-scale solutions was large amounts of people dying from climate change's impacts. ""We need to start getting comfortable with how extreme the problem is,"" she said, ""because only until we accept ... how bad climate change is and how bad it can be for our children's lives, are we going to be comfortable pursuing really big solutions."" Conservatives previously mocked Ocasio-Cortez when she suggested that the world only had 12 years to support life because of climate change.  Ocasio-Cortez, in turn, derided Republicans for failing to recognize what she described as ""sarcasm."" The freshman congresswoman has also called for a ban on single-use plastic and predicted that melting glaciers could release ancient diseases with unknown effects on humans.",13/09/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/media/aoc-miami-few-years
"Daniel Turner: Ocasio-Cortez says climate change may drown Miami ??As usual, she?? laughably wrong","In the old European folktale, Chicken Little went into a panic and started screaming The sky is falling, the sky is falling to all the animals she could find, warning that the world was coming to an end. In real life today, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is panicking and telling us the oceans are rising and the end of the world is near because of climate change. Both warnings of doom and gloom are equally melodramatic and overwrought. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.  who pretends shes an expert on climate, energy and the superiority of her beloved socialism  has been receiving a lot of criticism for her statement last week claiming that because of climate change, Miami may not exist in a few years. AOC APPEARS TO CLAIM MIAMI WILL BE GONE 'IN A FEW YEARS' BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE Speaking at an NAACP forum to drum up support of her radical multitrillion-dollar Green New Deal that would bring economic disaster to the U.S., the freshman congresswoman said: ""What is not realistic is not responding to the crisis  not responding with a solution on the scale of the crisis. ...Because what's not realistic is Miami not existing in a few years. That's not realistic. So, we need to be realistic about the problem."" Thats a lot of nots. Or not. To lose Miami or not to lose Miami, that is the question. Well, my advice to the good people of Miami and their friends and relatives in other parts of the country is to take what Ocasio-Cortez says with a grain  make that a ton  of salt. She has absolutely no idea what she is talking about. Keep in mind that Ocasio-Cortez said not too long ago that the world would become unlivable in 12 years unless we made massive changes  including some that are scientifically impossible  to all our energy choices and the way we live our lives. When her prediction of the end of the world drew ridicule, she backpedaled and said she was only being sarcastic. Sure she was. Statements like those by Ocasio-Cortez make the climate change crusade looks as hyperbolic and devoid of science as many know it is. Even people without advanced degrees in climatology or geology (like AOC herself) know her absurd statements are demonstrably untrue. A few years is a relatively short period of time, and for her statement to be even remotely true, we would need to see evidence of rising waters every single day. How will Miami, or all coastal cities, succumb to the seas? Will it be a slow encroachment  a constant rise of tides that every day inch higher and higher? Because if thats the case the locals should be able to observe tomorrow, or next week, something measurably different in their coastal surroundings than they do today. Or will Miami be flooded like it was in the movie The Day After Tomorrow, in which a giant wave washes over the city? If this happens, where would the wave originate?  It must be from the melting ice caps, something we hear about constantly, right? Dont bet on it. Its been 10 years since former Vice President Al Gore said on this video: ... some of the models suggest ... that there is a 75 percent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during summer, during some of the summer months, could be completely ice-free within the next five to seven years. Earlier this month a group of climate change activists en route to document the vanishing ice needed to be rescued halfway between the North Pole and Norway. Their boat, the Malmo, got stuck in ice. There is another way to create such giant waves: King Triton can generate them. For those of you not familiar with his majesty, he is the king of the seas in the Disney cartoon The Little Mermaid. The cartoon came out in 1989  the same year Ocasio-Cortez was born. Perhaps the congresswoman can subpoena King Triton to testify before Congress. According to Ocasio-Cortez  and many other Democrats, including some presidential candidates   climate change is the most important issue facing us today and no sacrifice is too great and no program too costly to fight it. It is the equivalent of an earlier generations fight in World War II  or maybe even bigger. I have to disagree. Last year in America more than 70,000 people died of opioid overdoses. Every night more than 500,000 homeless people sleep on our nations streets. Each day 20 of our military veterans and active-duty military service members commit suicide on average  maybe one of them while you are reading this. None of these issues is granted the same soaring rhetoric of moral consequence as climate change, let alone hours of televised presidential town halls like the recent seven-hour marathon on CNN. And while there are real human, material and moral needs in America, there is also much to celebrate, especially in an industry that is repeatedly and willfully maligned by the left-wing climate warriors: the fossil fuel industry. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Last year New Mexico had a budget surplus of $1.2 billion, thanks to oil and gas revenue. When leftists clamor for funding programs to benefit children, the poor, migrants and other groups, this is where the money comes from. Employment in this field continues to grow at 1.7 percent and most of these jobs do not require expensive four-year college degrees. All this while carbon dioxide emissions  the very pollutants that give climate activists nightmares  continue to decrease. I dont see anyone applauding this. Saying Miami will be gone in a few years is a silly comment that deserves criticism. But more so, the effort to brand climate change a moral crisis worthy of bankrupting our economy and eliminating the jobs of millions of Americans needs to stop.  The fossil fuel industry is not Americas enemy, and political leaders like AOC should either temper their words or reject the very oil, gas, coal, electricity, plastic, and inexpensive food and material goods that make help America the greatest place on Earth.

Doomsdays that didn?? happen: Think tank compiles decades??worth of dire climate predictions,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently suggested Miami would disappear in ""a few years"" due to climate change. The United Nations is convening a ""Climate Action Summit"" next week. And climate activist Greta Thunberg is on Capitol Hill this week telling lawmakers they must act soon. But while data from NASA and other top research agencies confirms global temperatures are indeed rising, a newly compiled retrospective indicates the doomsday rhetoric is perhaps more overheated. NYC SAYS 1.1M STUDENTS CAN ATTEND CLIMATE STRIKE PROTEST WITHOUT PUNISHMENT  The conservative-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute has put together a lengthy compilation of apocalyptic predictions dating back decades that did not come to pass, timed as Democratic presidential candidates and climate activists refocus attention on the issue. The dire predictions, often repeated in the media, warned of a variety of impending disasters  famine, drought, an ice age, and even disappearing nations  if the world failed to act on climate change. An Associated Press headline from 1989 read ""Rising seas could obliterate nations: U.N. officials."" The article detailed a U.N. environmental official warning that entire nations would be eliminated if the world failed to reverse warming by 2000. Then there were the fears that the world would experience a never-ending ""cooling trend in the Northern Hemisphere."" That claim came from an ""international team of specialists"" cited by The New York Times in 1978. Just years prior, Time magazine echoed other media outlets in suggesting that ""another ice age"" was imminent. ""Telltale signs are everywhere  from the unexpected persistence and thickness of pack ice in the waters around Iceland to the southward migration of a warmth-loving creature like the armadillo from the Midwest,"" the magazine warned in 1974. The Guardian similarly warned in 1974 that ""Space satellites show new Ice Age coming fast."" In 1970, The Boston Globe ran the headline, ""Scientist predicts a new ice age by 21st century."" The Washington Post, for its part, published a Columbia University scientist's claim that the world could be ""as little as 50 or 60 years away from a disastrous new ice age."" Some of the more dire predictions came from Paul Ehrlich, a biologist who famously urged population control to mitigate the impacts of humans on the environment. Ehrlich, in 1969, warned that ""everybody"" would ""disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years,"" The New York Times reported. According to The Salt Lake Tribune, Ehrlich, warning of a ""disastrous"" famine,"" urged placing ""sterilizing agents into staple foods and drinking water."" ANDY PUZDER: HERE'S WHY DEMS WANT TO GENERATE CLIMATE PANIC (AS THEY IGNORE WAYS TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS) Those predictions were made around the time former President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. Since then, the U.S. has adopted a series of environmental reforms aimed at limiting emissions. Years after those initial predictions, media outlets and politicians continue to teem with claims of apocalyptic scenarios resulting from climate change. Earlier this month, leading Democratic presidential candidates held a town hall on the issue and warned about the ""existential"" threat posed by a changing climate. Before the end of the month, 2020 candidates are expected to have another climate forum at Georgetown University. CEI's report came just before the U.N. Climate Action Summit on Sept. 23, an event that promises to ""spark the transformation that is urgently needed and propel action that will benefit everyone."" It also came a week after Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., warned that Miami would be gone in a ""few years"" because of climate change. She was responding to critics of her ambitious ""Green New Deal,"" which seeks to reach net-zero emissions within just decades.  Ocasio-Cortez, whose plan has been endorsed by leading presidential candidates, previously joked that the world would end in 12 years if it didn't address climate change. But short-term predictions weren't a laughing matter in the years following ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" a documentary produced by former Vice President Al Gore. In 2008, ABC released an ominous video about what the world would look like in 2015. As the video warned about rising sea levels, a graphic showed significant portions of New York City engulfed by water. Gore himself famously predicted in the early 2000s that Arctic ice could be gone within seven years.

"In climate-change fight, college student launches push to stop childbirth until governments act","A Canadian college student is asking other young people to forgo having children in an effort to get their governments to take serious steps to address climate change. Emma Lim, an 18-year-old student at McGill University in Montreal, created the #NoFutureNoChildren movement in response to the perceived lackluster efforts from Canadian leaders on the issue. ""I have always, always wanted to be a mom, for as long as I can remember,"" Lim told Insider. ""But I will not bring a child into a world where they will not be safe. I would like to see the government develop a comprehensive plan to stay below 1.5 degrees of warming."" As of Thursday, more than 1,400 young people had signed on. AOC SAYS SHE'S WOKEN UP AT 3:30 A.M. BECAUSE OF HER ANXIETY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ""I am taking the pledge because I deserve to live in a planet that is taken care of, a planet that is cherished,"" wrote Iffat Hasan, 18, of Ottawa, Ontario. Jacob Diercks, 18, of Germany, signed on, saying he lived near the North Sea, which has warmed in recent years. He said farmers there have lost crops to floods and hot weather. ""I see it as irresponsible to bring children into such dangers,"" he wrote. ""Our government is doing too little to protect the climate and thus our region."" Multiple reports have warned of a catastrophic scenario if steps are not taken to reduce carbon emissions, pollutants and other types of human behavior responsible for warmer temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns. CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVIST GRETA THUNBERG, 16, TELLS HOUSE COMMITTEES: 'UNITE BEHIND THE SCIENCE' AND 'TAKE REAL ACTION' Lim said climate change has been a ""fact of life"" for her generation. In addition to addressing the problem, she's called for a plan to help those affected by climate change, such as people losing their jobs in the agricultural, oil and gas industries. ""I launched the pledge because I wanted other people to understand how the fear of climate is so unquestioned in my generation,"" she said. ""It's something everybody feels. Where in my parent's or grandparent's generation, believing in climate change is often a matter of opinion and not survival."" She added that many young people have believed their governments will fix things, but ""that trust in your leaders erodes over time."" Teens around the world have taken a more active role in bringing attention to the issue. Youth climate activist and Swedish teen Greta Thunberg, 16, testified in front of Congress this week about the importance of climate-change activism. She started skipping school on Fridays to stand outside of her country's parliament to protest what she called inaction by government leaders.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has made climate change a centerpiece issue and has pushed for the passage of her ambitious Green New Deal, which calls for a dramatic reduction in emissions, along with universal health care, affordable housing, and ""economic security."" The New York Democrat previously suggested that young people were concerned about having children because of climate change.",19/09/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/world/no-future-no-children-climate-change-college-student
5 inconvenient truths about the 'climate strike',"Thousands of students around the world are leaving class Friday, going on ""strike"" to demand immediate action against climate change. But critics say they miss these important big-picture facts. 1. GRETA THUNBERG, WHO STARTED THE CLIMATE STRIKE, CALLS CLIMATE CHANGE AN ""EXISTENTIAL EMERGENCY""  BUT U.N. ESTIMATES ARE LESS ALARMING. Some climate scientists say the term ""existential emergency,"" meaning the existence of humanity itself is endangered, is scaremongering. ""Climate strikers and others (including most of the Democratic presidential candidates) refer to climate change as an existential crisis. This is nonsense,"" Judith Curry, a climate scientist and former professor at Georgia Tech, told Fox News. The Earth has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit since satellite data collection began in 1979. The United Nations' average models forecast a further rise of between 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. FIVE MOST OVER-THE-TOP CLIMATE WARNINGS Curry says the high end of the U.N.s estimates are based on implausible scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. But others say ""climate strikers"" are right to fear. The reason that the forecast temperature rise is an existential crisis for many species on Earth is that it is happening so fast, Alasdair Skelton, Professor of Geochemistry at Stockholm University, told Fox News. Species, including ourselves, are unlikely to be able to adapt at the pace of ongoing human-induced climate change, he added. Economists, however, say humans will adapt. A 2018 study by economist Richard Tol in the journal Review of Environmental Economics and Policy found that climate change ""will likely have a limited impact on the economy and human welfare in the 21st century."" Climate activists take a dim view of human ingenuity, Tol told Fox News regarding past failed environmental doom stories.                                                                                                      2. EMISSIONS-FREE BOAT TRIP POLLUTED MORE THAN AIR TRAVEL. Greta Thunberg took an emissions-free boat from Europe to the U.S.  but her sea voyage actually spewed more carbon emissions than flying would have. That was first reported by left-leaning German news outlet TAZ, which interviewed a spokesman for the boat operators and found that the boat trip required at least six flights  more than if she had simply flown to the U.S. and back. Critics say it shows that Thunberg's trip is not really about reducing carbon. ""It's nothing more than virtue signaling,"" said Marc Morano, publisher of Climate Depot, a website that's skeptical about the impact of climate change. 10 TIMES 'EXPERTS' PREDICTED THE WORLD WOULD END BY NOW ""Greta took this carbon-fiber, very expensive yacht... The media is completely whitewashing this,"" he added. But others defend the trip for raising awareness. ""I think that Greta is showing a point how difficult it is to go fossil free as an individual without changing the system. That is why it is so important to change the system,"" Ingmar Rentzhog, the founder of ""We Don't Have Time"" and the man who first publicized Thunberg's climate strike, told Fox News. Rentzhog noted that he didn't speak for Thunberg. 3. SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SUPPORT THE ""CLIMATE STRIKE."" The San Diego Unified School Board unanimously resolved that the board is ""proud of students leadership in calling for aggressive climate action."" The board also pushed teachers to support student Global Climate Walkout events. Schools should not be political tools, Anthony Watts, who runs the skeptical climate site WattsUpWithThat.com, told Fox News. As a former school board member, I'm concerned that enabling this sort of behavior... will encourage... school protests on a variety of topics. ERROR IN MAJOR CLIMATE STUDY REVEALED  WARMING NOT HIGHER THAN EXPECTED Some major cities, including New York City and Boston, have announced that kids are allowed to skip school for the climate strike if they have a note from their parent. Others, including Chicago, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, have not granted blanket amnesty for class-skipping students. 4. THE CLIMATE STRIKE WEBSITE ATTACKS ALL FOSSIL FUELS, EVEN THOSE THAT HELP REDUCE EMISSIONS. The International Climate Strike website states: ""People everywhere are at risk if we let oil, coal and gas companies continue to pour more fuel on the fire."" It demands ""100% renewable energy access for all"" to happen ""swiftly."" Skleton defends that, noting, burning natural gas puts carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which causes global warming. Others say that misses the mark, noting that in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions fell over the last ten years thanks to increased production of relatively-clean natural gas. CATASTROPHIC GLOBAL WARMING LESS LIKELY, STUDY SAYS The U.S. is doing better than most European countries at reducing emissions, and it's because of tech advances in fracking and natural gas  which activists are just ideologically opposed to, Morano said. ""The strategy for only using renewables in the near term is a fantasy,"" Curry said, adding that nuclear power is the only feasible option for such a switch  but it is not trendy. 5. THUNBERG'S STRIKE WAS PARTLY BUILT UP BY ACTIVISTS. Many media outlets cover the climate strike and Greta Thunberg uncritically. A Vice article described her as the girl who changed the world and the voice of a generation who spontaneously started the climate strike. But critics say that her strike was timed within weeks of a book release by her mother about activism, and the climate strike idea was proposed to her by climate activist Bo Thoren. When Thunberg decided to do it, Thoren told another activist, Ingmar Rentzhog, who photographed her one-girl strike and used his ""We Don't Have Time"" organization to spread the word. This is no secret, Rentzhog told Fox News of the tip-off, adding that rumors he knew Thunbergs parents were false. AL GORE WOULD HAVE LOST GLOBAL WARMING BET, ACADEMIC SAYS Ideas mean nothing if not that someone is willing to make a reality of them, Rentzhog added in defense of Thunberg. And Greta... has a great talent to express herself in a very clear and direct way about the problem. But critics say the ""climate strike"" is a sad testament to activists' successful efforts to scare kids. Polling data shows kids are fearful about climate, coming into school with anxiety  even when the U.N. models dont justify that fear, Morano said.

West Virginia governor on 2020 Dems' 'way out' climate change rhetoric: They don't understand importance of...,"Republican West Virginia Governor Jim Justice reacted Friday to the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls who are vowing to take bold action against climate change. You see the cast of characters that are spewing out this stuff just to get on the soapbox and make a scene, Justice told Fox &amp; Friends. The governor's comments came as school districts across the country are debating whether to follow New York Citys lead after it allowed its students to participate in Friday's global youth climate strikes without punishment. Justice said that many do not understand how important the coal and gas industries are to the country. He said if there were a hypothetical moratorium on those industries for 60 or 90 days, the impact would be ""beyond belief."" ""We just don't think about that,"" he added. WEST VIRGINIA GOVERNOR ON STATE'S ECONOMIC BOOM: 'THANKFUL' COAL MINERS PUT HILLARY CLINTON 'OUT OF BUSINESS' Hillary Clinton famously vowed in 2016 to ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"" through policies geared toward new energy sources. She lost every county in the state to Trump after drawing the ire of coal miners and the state led the nation in GDP growth and personal income growth in the first quarter of 2019. In West Virginia, weve got so many great people that go to work every day and do great stuff for this nation, Justice said. IN WEST VIRGINIA SENATE RACE, COAL MINING TAKES CENTER STAGE ANDREW YANG WANTS TO OVERHAUL PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE WITH ELECTRIC CARS Meanwhile, 2020 Democratic hopeful Andrew Yang suggested at a climate change forum on Thursday that the U.S. should try addressing climate change by raising the cost of beef. A Georgetown student claimed reducing demand on the cattle industry was the only realistic way to mitigate the industry's impact on the environment. ""Cattle is very energy-consuming and energy-expensive,"" Yang said, ""and if you project forward on what we would need to do to reduce emissions, you would want to modify Americans' diets over time.""  Justice, a former Democrat, said the ideas coming from the left on climate change are far outside the mainstream. ""This is not a conservative Democrat way either, this is such a way out philosophy that all it's going to do is destroy America and the way of life we have today and that we've celebrated for years and years,"" he said. It is absolutely a crying shame as to what people are doing in preying on the uninformed.""",20/09/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/media/west-virginia-governor-dems-climate-change-rhetoric
Global Climate Strike kicks off with thousands skipping school or work for demonstrations across the world,"The worldwide climate protest partially inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg kicked off Friday in major  and smaller  cities around the globe Friday with hundreds of thousands of students hitting the streets. In Indias capital of New Delhi, a crowd of a few dozen people quickly swelled to several hundred outside the citys historic Lodhi garden, a sprawling park that is home to medieval royal tombs. What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now! they chanted as they walked down the street. We need to reclaim our constitutional right to clean air and water, said Aman Sharma, a 16-year-old protester in New Delhi. GRETA THUNBERG CALLS AOC AN 'ICON,' TELLS CONGRESS URGENT ACTION NEEDED Australia, with more than 300,000 protesters taking to the streets around the country, saw its largest demonstration since the start of the Iraq War in 2003. Even though we ourselves arent sick, the planet which we live on is, and we are protesting and fighting for it, Siobhan Sutton, a 15-year-old student at Perth Modern School in the west coast city of Perth, told the AP. She said she would fail a math exam by attending the protest. ""I have basically been told that because it is not a valid reason to be missing school  it is not a medical reason or anything  I am going to get a zero on the test if I don't actually sit it,"" Sutton said. Thunberg, who has staged weekly demonstrations under the heading Fridays for Future over the past year, has been calling on world leaders to step up their efforts against climate change. She is expected to speak at the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York City on Monday. CLIMATE ACTIVIST GRETA THUNBERG, 16, TELLS HOUSE COMMITTEES: 'UNITE BEHIND THE SCIENCE' AND 'TAKE REAL ACTION Rallies were expected in major cities across Asia, Europe, Africa, and the United States, where organizers say more than 800 events are expected Friday. In Germany, which has seen large-scale climate rallies for over a year, police said 17,000 people had gathered in the southwestern city of Freiburg, one of 500 cities across the country where protests were planned. In the capital Berlin and Germany's financial hub of Frankfurt, some protesters staged brief road blockades to highlight their demands for a drastic reduction in the country's greenhouse gas emissions, to which transport is a major contributor. Photos from Berlin showed three people standing over ice blocks under gallows. Across London, hundreds of schoolchildren descended outside Westminster to make their voices heard. The Metropolitan Police tweeted that it had already arrested two protesters on alleged public order offenses. NYC SAYS 1.1M STUDENTS CAN ATTEND CLIMATE STRIKE PROTEST WITHOUT PUNISHMENT In the Afghan capital Kabul, about 100 young people - with several young women in the front carrying a banner emblazoned with ""Fridays for Future,"" marched in the city. Fardeen Barakzai, one of the organizers and head of the local save-the-climate group called Oxygen said ""we want to do our part. We as the youth of our country know the problem of climate change. We know war can kill a group of people ... the problem in Afghanistan is our leaders are fighting for power but the real power is in nature."" Supporting the demonstrators were mayors from across the world  including Paris, Los Angeles, New York City, Copenhagen, and London  who issued a strongly worded joint statement overnight. Our shared planet is facing a climate emergency. The science is clear that, without urgent action, sea levels will rise further, extreme temperatures will become the norm and climate-related disasters will inflict even greater damage, they said. When your house is on fire, somebody needs to sound the alarm. Young people in our cities, displaying incredible maturity and dignity are doing just that. School children are taking to the streets, drawing attention to the terrifying threat that climate breakdown poses to their future. Rallies were also held in Kenya's capital Nairobi, Johannesburg and the South African capital, Pretoria.  Experts say Africa is the most vulnerable continent to climate change and the least equipped to deal with it. Governments have pleaded for more support from the international community.

Carol Roth: Stop scaring our kids ??the world is NOT about to end and we are NOT all about to die,"Children today should be enjoying their youth. They arguably live in the greatest time ever, with unparalleled access to information, connectivity around the globe, advances in health care and tremendous opportunity. But instead of embracing optimism, the adults in their lives are filling them with fear. In the last few weeks, from town halls on climate change to climate justice marches, I have seen scores of children  some teens, some squarely of elementary school-age  proclaim their anxiety about the world ending. Depending on the source, children are being told that if we dont act right now to solve one particular crisis or another, we will all be dead in anywhere from 18 months to 12 years. Thats not a message of hope and optimism that kids should be embracing. 'RUN FOR AMERICA' CO-FOUNDER BACKS CLIMATE STRIKE: WE ARE DEALING WITH A 'CRISIS' While it is great for children to learn to be responsible global citizens and take care of our planet, theres a positive and responsible way to communicate that. I recall in my own childhood celebrating Earth Day, where we raised money to help plant more trees (something that actually helps the environment, by the way) and learned about recycling, all without having the living daylights scared out of us. Adults can deliver the message of taking care of the planet and have an impact doing so with positive language and outcomes instead of nihilistic ones. While I am not a psychologist (and I dont play one on TV, either), I do believe that for kids, who are developing mentally, having this fear communicated to them during this critical time of their lives is abusive. Worse, it is done by parents, schools, the media and politicians alike. Everyone needs to immediately get a grip. I remember when adults acted like adults instead of fear-mongers. Back in the 80s, when network television ran the nuclear war movie The Day After, there were warnings that it wasnt appropriate for children and our parents wouldnt let us watch it. Now, the adults who are supposed to be shielding kids from unlikely doomsday scenarios are forcing those beliefs upon them and using the kids as political pawns. Its not just the climate change fear. I am not the first one to note that school shooter drills are also an unnecessary form of fear theater that does far more harm than good. While any school shooting is one too many and more needs to be done to ensure school safety, planting the security threat in kids heads with practice drills surely creates needless trauma with no evidence of better outcomes.  Negativity is all around us, from mainstream media to social media. Its not healthy for us to be constantly consuming a negative information diet, particularly when the general outlook for life is so robust. We need more gratitude towards the abundance, opportunities and advancements that surround us. As an adult, if you want to mire yourself in pessimism, thats your choice. But please, leave the kids out of it.

91-year-old among 10 arrested at Extinction Rebellion climate change protests in the United Kingdom,"Ten people have been arrested during an Extinction Rebellion climate change protest in the United Kingdom, with the group aiming for a ""blockade"" of the local port in Dover, England. Climate change activists 'glued' themselves to a section of the roadway on Saturday, which caused a backlog of traffic before one of the groups was dragged away by police, according to the Independent. They hung large banners with the Extinction Rebellion logo on them from the town's famous white cliffs, as well as a local castle. Activists hoped to bring awareness to the United Kingdom's reliance on food imports, the outlet reported. GLOBAL CLIMATE STRIKE KICKS OFF WITH THOUSANDS SKIPPING SCHOOL OR WORK FOR DEMONSTRATIONS ACROSS THE WORLD The Extinction Rebellion says they're an international activist group that uses non-violent methods to encourage leaders to take action on climate change and environmental issues, according to the BBC. So far the group has made plenty of noise from their protests throughout the United Kingdom over the last couple of months. Even so, the protests don't seem to cause much harm, just traffic problems for residents. Kent police told protesters in Dover they could demonstrate in a specific area near the ferry point, and ""the large majority"" remained in the zone, the Independent reported. One of the men arrested for attempting to block roads near the main ferry terminal in Dover was a 91-year-old, who said upon his arrest: ""It's my generation that's caused all this trouble, so here I am."" Five others, also believed to be elderly, were arrested after sitting down and blocking traffic on the A20 road leading into the English town, the outlet reported. One of the activists, Emma Arnold, posted on Twitter that she was issued a ""breach of public order warning"" by the police for walking with her camera, adding that arrests were highly likely. PAIR OF UNDERWEAR BELONGING TO EVA BRAUN SELL AT AUCTION FOR MORE THAN $4,600 A spokesman for the Extinction Rebellion told the Independent the group made sure the blockade didn't ""cause any disruption to vital supplies"" needed for residents, such as medicine. Extinction Rebellion appreciates the blockade will directly affect ordinary people and businesses, but we feel the action is necessary in order to call the government to action,"" the spokesman added. The Port of Dover, the focal point for the blockade, told the Independent it was ""working closely with Kent Police to ensure as minimal disruption as possible."" The force is grateful to everyone who cooperated with efforts to ensure the rights of the protesters, and the wider public, were respected and it is pleasing we havent seen levels of disruption greater than what could be reasonably expected,"" Andy Pritchard, Kent Police's chief superintendent, told the Independent.

Climate change protests snarl DC traffic as bizarre scenes unfold in capital,"Climate activists demonstrating to coincide with the 2019 U.N. Climate Action Summit blocked intersections and snarled morning-commute traffic across Washington, D.C., Monday as they called on officials to take action on global warming. The group, called ""Shut Down D.C.,"" has planned a week of activities to bring attention to climate change and convince national and international leaders to act. Monday's continuation of the ""Global Climate Strike"" follows worldwide climate protests on Friday, including a demonstration in New York City led by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. ""Parents, workers, college students, and everyone who is concerned about the climate crisis will skip work and school and put off their other responsibilities to take action on the climate crisis,"" the organization says on its website. CARL ROTH: STOP SCARING OUR KIDS  THE WORLD IS NOT ABOUT TO END AND WE ARE NOT ALL ABOUT TO DIE But the demonstrations across D.C. Monday morning also angered the city's commuters as the scattered marches caused gridlock and detours. District of Columbia police reported making more than two-dozen arrests as of Monday afternoon. A D.C. blogger posted one photo of a mass of cars halted behind a line of protesters a few blocks northwest of Mount Vernon Square. The same blogger also tweeted a picture of a literal dumpster fire on Massachusetts Ave. At another protest site, police were using a saw to cut protesters out of chains attached to a painted boat. Another group of about 30 protesters blocked an intersection near Union Station, holding up a large mock pipeline that read ""stop pipelines now."" Police stopped traffic about a block in each direction and were moving vehicles around the area demonstrators had occupied. AMERICA 'ISOLATED' AT UN? GENERAL ASSEMBLY BREAKING WITH US ON MOST VOTES, REPORT FINDS The ""Shut Down D.C."" protesters read testimonials from anti-pipeline activists in Oregon before chanting, ""Hey-hey! Ho-ho! LNG has got to go."" LNG is an acronym for liquified natural gas. Protesters also adapted the famous song ""When The Saints Go Marching In"" for their purposes. ""Oh how I'd love to live in that future  when the frackers go to jail,"" they sang. While some passersby seemed to back the ""Shut Down D.C."" demonstrators, others were not so supportive. One woman walking by yelled at the demonstrators that there was a handicapped woman walking down the street because they'd blocked traffic. The protesters responded by saying people were dying because of the climate crisis.  ""You tell that to the woman walking with the cane up the street,"" the woman shot back. At approximately 9:45 a.m., the Twitter account purporting to represent the ""Shut Down D.C."" group claimed they were still blocking traffic at eight locations across the city, including Logan Circle and Dupont Circle.",23/09/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-change-protests-disrupt-d-c-morning-commute
Daniel Turner: The UN's traveling climate change salvation show -- Nothing saves the world like a meeting,"The United Nations and its thousands of ambassadors, staffers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and world community experts are all gathering in New York. And there is nothing the United Nations does better than meet. They are terrible, for example, at peacekeeping. In parts of Africa, the U.N. peacekeepers are the ones raping the refugees. The U.N. has been unwilling or at least unable to stop the practice. The U.N. takes human rights as seriously as they take peacekeeping. The United States withdrew last year from the U.N. Human Rights Council, which then-Ambassador Nikki Haley called a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias. The council, which has as members such bastions of human rights as China, Cuba, and Saudi Arabia, has passed resolutions condemning Israel more than every other nation combined. CAROL ROTH: STOP SCARING OUR KIDS  THE WORLD IS NOT ABOUT TO END AND WE ARE NOT ALL ABOUT TO DIE But what the U.N. does best, meet, it also does often. With annual expenditures hovering around $50 billion, theres plenty of money for some great meetings. And there is no other cause more worthy of international meetings than climate change. Its an existential threat, as the 2020 Democrat candidates have often repeated. And we only have 12 years left to fix it.  Or 11. Maybe 10. Regardless of the science, or lack thereof, one thing is certain: in order to tackle climate change, the U.N. needs a lot of meetings. Less than a year ago, 30,000 people attended a two-week event in Poland focused on climate change. With workshops, breakout sessions, soaring speeches, and weighty panels, the conference had a carbon footprint equivalent of an 8,000-person town for an entire year. One would hope those thousands of people accomplished something significant to justify such emissions. They didnt. So, they met again in April at a U.N. Climate Expo in Korea, but that was after the Nairobi U.N. Climate Assembly, held a month earlier in March which attracted 5,000 people from 179 nations. What the U.N. does best, meet, it also does often. With annual expenditures hovering around $50 billion, theres plenty of money for some great meetings. And there is no other cause more worthy of international meetings than climate change. Those climate change activists sure are racking up the frequent flier miles! After Korea came the June Abu Dhabi U.N. Climate Conference.  There, thousands of concerned jet-setting eco-warriors gathered around the central purpose: to take stock of progress so far. Regardless of the science, or lack thereof, one thing is certain: in order to tackle climate change, the U.N. needs a lot of meetings. They must not have been happy with the results because three weeks later was the next U.N. Climate Conference in Bonn. Put away the hummus and get out the Schnitzel. The stated goal of the Germany conference was, and this is no joke, to set the stage for raising ambition. Not exactly Churchillian. The U.N. calls climate change the greatest threat to human rights, but seeing how their peacekeepers and human rights commissioners act, its not surprising their actions are more like HR meetings and corporate icebreakers. After an entire year of taking stock and having set the stage on multiple continents at magnificent resorts, here we are in New York City. And this time its serious. Maybe this U.N. conference will inspire us to get on the same page or test the waters. Regardless of the jargon, there will be meetings and memos and PowerPoints. And lunches and dinners and banquets. I looked online at the top 10 hotels in the city. Every one of them is booked solid.

Just in case the New York City conference doesnt achieve all of its goals, fret not. The next U.N. Climate Conference is already on the books for December in Santiago, Chile. There, during an entire week, thousands of climate-change activists will do what they do best: meet. And that meeting may even generate a resolution. It certainly will generate more meetings.  The fear-mongering rhetoric on climate change will continue to ramp up during our 2020 presidential election. More politicians will call for bans on meat, on coal, on cars. You will be told to alter your life, give up your property, change your diet. And in the midst of that radical posturing, as you are told of an imminent end of civilization, remember the world leaders, the ones who care the most about the issue, the ones leading the very charge, are unable to jump on a conference call. Next time you are told to put down your cheeseburger by politicians who arrived in your town on a chartered jet, tell them they should leave the campaign trail and go work for the U.N.

Pastors praise Trump for skipping UN panel on 'imaginary' climate crisis for 'real' problem of religious pe...,"President Trump is reportedly skipping a climate change event Monday at the United Nations headquarters to give a historic speech on religious freedom and global persecution against believers. With more than 80 percent of the world's population living in areas where religious freedom is ""highly restricted,"" according to the State Department's International Religious Freedom Report, two pastors tell Fox News Trump's keynote address at an event called the Global Call to Protect Religious Freedom set for Monday is a major step for the faithful.

TODD STARNES: THE LEFT WANTS TO REPLACE GOD WITH SOCIALISM Tony Perkins, heads the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and is the president of the conservative think tank Family Research Council, said this administration has done more to advance religious liberty in the nation's foreign policy than any previous ones, hosting two ministerials to advance religious freedom with world leaders. ""This is the president kind of putting down a marker...advancing religious freedom. This is a step forward with very tangible markers in terms of protecting people of faith, and what president...is going to do is challenge these nations to ensure that, people regardless of their faith, when they publicly assemble to worship God that they don't have to do that in fear of terrorists or tyrants."" Perkins said studies show countries that embrace and protect religious freedom have greater social and economic stability, benefiting America in the long run. Jeffress added that Trump has made this a big part of his platform since the campaign trail. ""He said religious freedom is not granted by government it is gifted to us by God, and the president believes that,"" Jeffress said. ""The Democrats believe the great human right that transcends all others is the right to kill your own babies through abortion and the previous administration supported that for the world. ... This president says no, it's not the murder of babies that is a basic human right, it is religious liberty that is granted by our creator.""  White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told ""Fox &amp; Friends"" it ""wouldn't surprise"" her if Trump makes a surprise visit to the climate change event at the UN.",23/09/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values/trump-un-religious-freedom-persecution-climate-change
GOP Sen. Inhofe giving out 'Climate Hypocrite Awards' for Global Climate Week,"As activists around the world protest for Global Climate Change Week, all timed with the U.N. Climate Action Summit, one GOP senator announced Monday he is giving out ""Climate Hypocrite Awards."" Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who once threw a snowball on the Senate floor in an effort to challenge the climate change theory, said he will give out five awards in total, one each day of the week, with Penn State professor and climate activist Michael Mann being the first honored. ""To kick off Global Climate Week, it seems most fitting to first recognize Michael Mann, the architect of the discredited Hockey Stick graph who tells people to believe the science but was implicated in manipulating data in Climategate and refuses to provide the data to back up his graph,"" Inhofe said on his website. CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS SNARL DC TRAFFIC AS BIZARRE SCENES UNFOLD IN CAPITAL ""Climategate"" refers to a 2009 scandal in which emails between Mann and other scientists were leaked. They seemingly discussed deleting information and hiding data that did not support the conclusion that climate change is a potentially catastrophic issue. Mann's famous hockey stick graph shows the correlation between global temperatures and the amount of carbon dioxide  a greenhouse gas that holds in the earth's heat rather than letting it escape into space  in the atmosphere over time. The graph gets its name from the shape created as both temperatures and carbon dioxide rise sharply around the start of the industrial revolution, when humans began using fossil fuels for electricity, transportation and other purposes. BILL REQUIRING DC PROTESTERS TO PAY FOR POLICE OVERTIME PLANNED BY GOP CONGRESSMAN While Inhofe, the author of a 2012 book titled ""The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future,"" denies human activity is causing potentially catastrophic changes in the earth's climate, the theory has gained wide acceptance, even among some in Inhofe's own party. Firebrand conservative Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., released a ""Green Real Deal"" plan earlier this year in response to progressive Democrats' ""Green New Deal."" ""Global Warming is real, humans contribute, and it has real impacts on how the military will operate, both now and into the future,"" he said in an April release about his plan that leans on the free market to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ""That is why I have introduced the Green Real Deal this Congress."" The 2018 U.N. Climate Change Annual Report predicted a rise in global temperatures by three to five degrees Celcius by 2100 if current trends continue. The report sets a goal of capping the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celcius to prevent more drastic impacts but warns the window to accomplish that goal will close by the year 2030.  Mann has defended his hockey stick graph in the past, citing other academics who, he says, have confirmed his data and conclusions.",24/09/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-sen-inhofe-giving-out-climate-hypocrite-awards-for-global-climate-week
David Webb: 'Climate change is the religion of the Left...prosperous America is Satan',"As climate week at the United Nations kicked off, Fox Nation host David Webb had strong words on the issue, accusing the Left of ""turning climate change into their religion."" DAVID WEBB STOPS VACATION TO RESPOND TO JEMELE HILL'S STATEMENT ""Climate change revision is the reformation of the new global warming cult. It's the religion of the Left,"" he said on his Fox Nation show ""Reality Check."" Webb blamed the Left for ""scaring the younger generations"" in order to spread their ""climate change hysteria,"" and accused them of advocating for the wrong solution. GUTFELD ON CLIMATE CHANGE HYSTERIA PROTESTS ""They're easy to frighten, just tell them their world is ending... but do all these climate strikers know what they're protesting for? Seems the discussion is more often centered around [carbon dioxide] than the environment at large,"" he said. The discussion should be focused on the environment as a whole, including the economic environment explained Webb, who accused the Left of focusing specifically on fossil fuels and ""other clever buzzwords."" ""Our environment is everything around us including and importantly, our economic environment.  We have to be able to afford the things we want to do,"" Webb said. ABBY HUNSTMAN CLASHES WITH JOY BEHAR OVER CLIMATE 'GUILT TRIPPING Webb also threw jabs at the highly contentious Green New Deal.  ""After all it's the big New Green Deal, which isn't the real deal, and America the prosperous is the Satan.  Hey, every religion needs a Satan,"" Webb said. ""What if I told you,"" Webb continued, ""that there is a clean, capitalist, conservative approach to help our environment founded on conservative principals,"" he asked. Later in the episode, Webb sat down with a panel of experts to explore the ""conservative approach"" as they tackled one of the largest issues surrounding American politics today.

Laura Ingraham blasts liberals for using children to promote 'doomsday scenarios',"Laura Ingraham went after liberals Monday for pushing ""climate change hysteria"" and using children to do it. ""The puppet masters, the adults who are pushing a radical anti-carbon agenda that goes way beyond conservationism... they've been even willing to use children, innocent children, to sell their doomsday scenarios all for dramatic effect,"" Ingraham said on ""The Ingraham Angle."" CARL ROTH: STOP SCARING OUR KIDS  THE WORLD IS NOT ABOUT TO END AND WE ARE NOT ALL ABOUT TO DIE World leader after world leader told the United Nations on Monday that they will do more to prevent a warming world from reaching dangerous levels. Before the world leaders made their promises in three-minute speeches, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg in an emotional speech chided the leaders with the repeated phrase, ""How dare you?"" Ingraham argued that adults should be reassuring their children, not using them to push their agenda. ""The adults who brainwash these kids should be brought up on charges of child abuse,"" Ingraham said.  ""We should be reassuring the young people and telling them that the science shows that climate trends that we're experiencing are natural."" The host argued that liberals are looking to use climate change to confiscate wealth and gain power.  ""Liberals want to use this global crisis to perpetuate a massive confiscation of wealth.

UN report on world's oceans is damning: 'We're all in big trouble',"A damning new report from the United Nations says that the world's oceans are undergoing drastic, accelerated change. And the risks associated with these changes to the climate are getting ever greater, threatening hundreds of millions of people and the global economy itself. The report, issued by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), highlights the changes that are happening as a result of increased emissions from greenhouse gases, including: sea levels rising by three feet by 2100; significantly fewer fish in the oceans; stronger hurricanes; and regular flooding in coastal cities such as New York. ""Global warming has already reached 1 [degrees Celsius] above the pre-industrial level, due to past and current greenhouse gas emissions,"" a press release issued in conjunction with the report said. ""There is overwhelming evidence that this is resulting in profound consequences for ecosystems and people. The ocean is warmer, more acidic and less productive. Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing sea level rise, and coastal extreme events are becoming more severe."" PLASTIC POLLUTION IN WORLDS' OCEANS COULD HAVE $2.5 TRILLION IMPACT, STUDY SAYS The report, which was worked on by more than 100 scientists from 36 countries around the world, was approved by the 195 IPCC member governments. Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, said that all parts of the globe, from the highest mountains to the deepest parts of the ocean, are being affected in a faster manner. The open sea, the Arctic, the Antarctic and the high mountains may seem far away to many people, Lee said in the press release. But we depend on them and are influenced by them directly and indirectly in many ways  for weather and climate, for food and water, for energy, trade, transport, recreation and tourism, for health and wellbeing, for culture and identity. Six hundred seventy million people live in high mountain regions, 680 million people are in low-lying coastal zones, 4 million live ""permanently"" in the Arctic region and 65 million people live on small island developing states, according to the report. ""The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble and that means we're all in big trouble too,"" one of the report's lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, told the Associated Press. ""The changes are accelerating."" The press release notes that ""without major investments in adaptation,"" rising flood risks are likely, some of which could cause ""some island nations"" to become uninhabitable ""due to climate-related ocean and cryosphere change."" NEW YORK CITY COULD SEE 'ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME' FLOODS EVERY YEAR 5 YEARS  The changes, which previous reports have said could shrink ""virtually all"" economies around the globe by 2100, will affect people, plants, food, societies, infrastructure, in addition to the global economy. The oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. The seas warm more slowly than the air but trap the heat longer with bigger side effects  and the report links these waters with Earth's snow and ice, called the cryosphere, because their futures are interconnected. ""The world's oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,"" said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in the release. The IPCC report adds to a previous report from the U.N. that some coastal cities and those in the Arctic region will have to adopt. The previous report, published on June 25 from the United Nations Human Rights Council, warned that a potential ""climate apartheid"" could fracture the global population, splitting the planet between the wealthy and the rest of the world who will be ""left to suffer."" CLIMATE CHANGE WILL SHRINK 'VIRTUALLY ALL' ECONOMIES AROUND THE GLOBE BY 2100, STUDY WARNS The report also notes that some of the changes to the Earth's climate from human-induced events can no longer be stopped, such as some rise in sea levels. The report found that seas are now rising at 3.66 millimeters per year, up from a previous estimate of 3 millimeters. Global sea-levels have risen 3.2 inches since 1993, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Other findings from the report include: MELTING PERMAFROST IN ARCTIC WILL HAVE $70 TRILLION IMPACT, NEW STUDY SAYS The report is conservative in some of its projections, including the levels of ice lost in Greenland and Antarctica, NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who was not part of the study, told the AP. ""We're not done revising our sea level rise projections and we won't be for a while,"" Willis said, adding that a rise in sea levels of twice the IPCC projections is possible. Despite the bleak nature of the report and it stating that some changes to the Earth's climate can longer be stopped, all hope is not lost. It calls on governments around the world to act and take swift action in an effort to mitigate some of the devastating effects. If we reduce emissions sharply, consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable, Lee said in the release. We increase our ability to build resilience and there will be more benefits for sustainable development. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions will limit impacts on ocean ecosystems that provide us with food, support our health and shape our cultures, Hans-Otto Portner, co-chair of IPCC Working Group II, concurred. Reducing other pressures such as pollution will further help marine life deal with changes in their environment while enabling a more resilient ocean.

Leonardo DiCaprio slams climate change deniers for living in an 'alternate reality',"Actor Leonardo DiCaprio -- who has taken heat for his preference for fuel-guzzling, private plane travel -- took harsh shots himself at climate change deniers in a speech supporting the young people who staged a worldwide climate protest in September. Thousands of people gathered in New York Citys Central Park Saturday for the 2019 Global Citizen Festival. There, they called on government and businesses to take action on key issues like climate change. The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actor gave a speech at the event in which he praised the recent Global Climate Strike and lambasted those who dont believe in climate change. LEONARDO DICAPRIO-BACKED FUND PLEDGES $5M IN AID FOR AMAZON WILDFIRES HYPOCRITICAL STARS TAKE PRIVATE JETS TO GOOGLE CLIMATE SUMMIT Last Friday, young people led the world in strike. Millions of individuals did more than simply walk out of their schools and places of employment. They took a stand. They set an example of true leadership that our planet so desperately needs. These young people have said clearly, definitively and without fear, that the time for inaction is over,"" said DiCaprio (via The Hollywood Reporter). ""Yet, surprisingly, some have reacted to this movement with insulting tweets and negative talking points  individuals that seem to care more about profit and their own self-interests than about your own future. But we know that the climate youth movement is more important and crucial than at any time in human history."" The outlet notes that DiCaprio concluded his speech by further chastising climate change deniers for living in an alternate reality. BRAD PITT TEASES LEONARDO DICAPRIO ABOUT INFAMOUS TITANIC DOOR SCENE PRINCE HARRY TOOK PRIVATE JET TO GOOGLE CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT There is no more time for denial, he said. DiCaprio spends a good portion of his off-screen time raising awareness on climate change. He even started the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, which is dedicated to building climate resiliency and protecting the planet's wildlife. However, his activism was questioned in recent years due to his travel habits. The actor was previously accused of racking up a hefty carbon footprint by traveling the world on private jets. Most recently, his attendance at a Google climate change conference in Sicily along with Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom and other A-list stars, was slammed as ""hypocritical,"" as 114 private jets dropped off their multimillionaires at the $20 million soiree. DiCaprio since announced a commitment to fly commercial more.

"Massive iceberg breaks off Antarctica, but it's not related to climate change","A gigantic iceberg broke off Antarctica recently, but scientists say the incident is part of a normal cycle and not related to climate change. The iceberg dubbed D28 reportedly broke away from the Amery ice shelf sometime between Sept. 24 and 25, based on observations from European and U.S. satellites. It contains 315 billion tons of ice, reports AFP, and this type of incident is simply part of the normal ice shelf cycle.

"Aggressive climate change protests hit major cities in Europe, Australia, more than 300 arrested","A group of extreme climate change activists around the globe has brought parts of London, France, Germany, and Australia to a standstill as they aggressively push politicians to cut carbon emissions. In London alone, the actions of the Extinction Rebellion group led to 319 arrests and prompted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to call the group ""uncooperative crusties."" ""I am afraid that the security people didn't want me to come along tonight before they said the road was full of uncooperative crusties,"" Reuters quoted Johnson as saying during an event Monday night. Crusties is a British slang term for eco-protesters. ""They said there was some risk I would be egged,"" he added. BREXIT DEAL IS 'ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE,' JOHNSON SAYS, IF EU STANDS BY TRADE DEMAND  Protesters said they didn't think Johnson's name-calling helped the tense situation. ""We're just ordinary people trying to express our deep disappointment with how slow the process of getting climate change action to occur is taking place, with the government not really listening, not really taking it forward on the scale it needs to be taken,"" Diane Jones told Reuters. Climate protesters in Australia and New Zealand also blocked roads, entered banks and energy companies on Monday. In Sydney, police were seen dragging elderly people and men in suits through the crowds as massive groups blocked roads in and out of the city. In all, police in Australia arrested about 30 people. In Britain, the aim of the group is to force the country to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2025. Currently, Britain's target is 2050.

"Ancient Mayans caused their own 'climate change,' shocking study says","A surprising new study suggests that ancient Mayans may have inadvertently caused their own demise by radically altering the climate. The research looks at newly found evidence in Belize that shows the Mayans responded to increases in population and environmental pressures by creating canals and wetlands. They also had regular ""burn events"" while farming their lands, which may have caused a rise in carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. We now are beginning to understand the full human imprint of the Anthropocene in tropical forests, said the study's lead author, Tim Beach, in a statement. These large and complex wetland networks may have changed climate long before industrialization, and these may be the answer to the long-standing question of how a great rainforest civilization fed itself. ANCIENT MAYAN CITY BURNED IN 'ACT OF TOTAL WAR,' SCIENTISTS SAY The Birds of Paradise wetland was ""five times larger than previously discovered,"" according to the release. Researchers also found another, even larger, wetland field complex in Belize. These perennial wetlands were very attractive during the severe Maya droughts, but the Maya also had to be careful with water quality to maintain productivity and human health, the study's co-author, Sheryl Luzzadder-Beach, added. The newly discovered evidence, based on aerial scans, is thought to have occurred between 1,800 and 1,000 years ago. Before recorded history, the largest increase in methane around the globe is thought to have occurred between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, coinciding with the increase in the Maya wetlands, as well as those seen in South America and China. Even these small changes may have warmed the planet, which provides a sobering perspective for the order of magnitude greater changes over the last century that are accelerating into the future, Beach added. The research has been published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. MYSTERIOUS LOST MAYA CITIES DISCOVERED IN GUATEMALAN JUNGLE The wetlands discovery is the latest in a series of fascinating Maya discoveries across central America. Last year an ancient mask depicting a 7th-century Maya king was discovered in southern Mexico. Separately in 2018, archaeologists used technology to reveal lost cities and thousands of ancient structures deep in the Guatemalan jungle, confirming that the Maya civilization was much larger than previously thought. From its heart in what is now Guatemala, the Maya empire reached the peak of its power in the sixth century A.D., according to History.com, although most of the civilizations cities were abandoned around 900 A.D.

One man in the U.K., reportedly affiliated with environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion, was removed from the top of a British Airways plane in an alleged bid to protest the planets climate emergency in a stunt that one police officer described as a reckless, stupid and dangerous. On Thursday, Paralympic medalist James Brown climbed atop a British Airways flight preparing for takeoff at London City Airport, The Independent reported and filmed the feat for social media.

Scientists want to make a 3D map of the entire world before climate change ruins it,"Earth is changing faster than anyone can comprehend. Every day, more forests burn, more glaciers melt and more evidence of the world's ancient cultures slips away. Change of some kind is, of course, inevitable  but it is happening more quickly and more severely because of the effects of human-caused climate change. And that has some scientists worried: The quicker Earth changes,the less time there is to learn from its past and understand its mysteries. Recently, two researchers proposed a way to preserve a record of our planet in its present state: use lasers to create a high-resolution, 3D map of the entire world. It's now the mission of a new nonprofit project called The Earth Archive, which is spearheaded by archaeologist Chris Fisher and geographer Steve Leisz, both of Colorado State University. ""The climate crisis threatens to destroy our cultural and ecological patrimony within decades,"" Fisher said earlier this year in a TEDx talk. ""How can we document everything before it's too late?"" Related: Hidden Maya Civilization Revealed Beneath Guatemala's Jungle Canopy The answer, Fisher said, is light detection and ranging, or lidar  a method of remote scanning that uses aircraft to shower a landscape with a dense net of laser beams. From this bombardment of light, researchers can create high-resolution, 3D maps of a given area and then digitally edit out foliage and other features that might be concealing hard-to-spot secrets near Earth's surface. The technique has become more prominent in archaeological surveys in the past decade, helping researchers uncover lost cities in heavily forested parts of Africa and South America, buried roads in ancient Rome and previously undiscovered cityscapes in Cambodia. In 2007, Fisher was part of a team that used lidar to uncover traces of a lost metropolis in the Honduran rainforest. These scans, Fisher said in his TEDx talk, revealed more details about the city's ruins in 10 minutes than he and his colleagues could have found in 10 years of research on the ground. The experience convinced Fisher that scientists need to ""scan, scan, scan"" to capture the world's most vulnerable places before they disappear. The Earth Archive's efforts would focus on scanning the planet's entire land area, which encompasses about 29% of the planet's surface, beginning with the most threatened regions, such as the Amazon rainforest and coastal regions at risk of being washed away by rising sea levels. The project would likely take decades, Fisher said, but the resulting snapshot of Earth would be ""the ultimate gift to future generations."" Doing this, of course, will require lots of funding; the project needs about $10 million just to scan most of the Amazon within the next three years, Fisher told The Guardian. That price tag has some other researchers worried about The Earth Archive's tenability. Mat Disney, a professor in the University College London Department of Geography, told The Guardian that such a project would inevitably draw funding away from other research projects. Even with proper funding, he added, getting permission to fly a research aircraft over restricted airspaces would prove to be a logistical hurdle. ""Who is going to give them permission to fly over Brazil? The Brazilian government aren't,"" Disney said, referring to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaros ongoing efforts to undermine science and open parts of the protected rainforest to commercial interests.

Extinction Rebellion protesters sought to paralyze parts of London on Friday, building a pyramid blocking off one of the citys busiest shopping streets. Protests blocked off the junction of Oxford and Regent Streets and erected bamboo poles into a pyramid shape with a tree branch hanging from the middle of it, Sky News reported.

Johnson returned from an EU summit in Brussels overnight for a busy day of meetings and phone calls as he attempted to persuade lawmakers to ratify the divorce deal at a rare Saturday sitting of Parliament. He was to brief his Cabinet on Friday afternoon, ahead of what's expected to be a knife-edge vote. Johnson's Conservative Party holds only 288 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons, so he will have to rely on support from other parties and independent lawmakers to get over the line.

Trump can begin steps to pull US out of Paris climate deal,"WASHINGTON (AP)  For more than two years President Donald Trump has talked about pulling the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement . Starting Monday he finally can do something about it. Even then, though, the withdrawal process takes a year and wouldn't become official until at least the day after the 2020 presidential election. In the Paris agreement, nearly 200 countries set their own national targets for reducing or controlling pollution of heat-trapping gases. It was negotiated in 2015 with lots of prodding by the United States and China and went into effect Nov. 4, 2016. The terms of the deal say no country can withdraw in the first three years. So Monday is the first time the U.S. could actually start the withdrawal process, which begins with a letter to the United Nations. And it doesn't become official for a year after that, which leads to the day after the election. If someone other than Trump wins in 2020, the next president could get back in the deal in just 30 days and plan to cut carbon pollution, said Andrew Light, a former Obama State Department climate negotiator now at the nonprofit World Resources Institute. Light and other experts say the withdrawal by the United States, the second biggest climate polluter and world's largest economy, will hurt efforts to fight global warming. ""Global objectives can't be met unless everybody does their part and the U.S. has to play the game,"" said Appalachian State University environmental sciences professor Gregg Marland, who is part of a global effort to track carbon dioxide emissions. ""We're the second biggest player. What happens to the game if we take our ball and go home?"" Someone else, probably the biggest polluter China, will take over leadership in the global fight, said MIT economist Jake Jacoby, who co-founded the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. The penalty for the U.S. ""is not in economic loss. The penalty is in shame, in discrediting U.S. leadership,"" Jacoby said. Asked what the U.S. plans next, State Department spokesman James Dewey on Friday emailed only this: ""The U.S. position with respect to the Paris Agreement has not changed. The United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement."" The agreement set goals of preventing another 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) to 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) of warming from current levels. Even the pledges made in 2015 weren't enough to prevent those levels of warming. The deal calls for nations to come up with more ambitious pollution cuts every five years, starting in November 2020 in at a meeting in Scotland. Because of the expected withdrawal, the U.S. role in 2020 negotiations will be reduced, Light said. Climate change, caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, has already warmed the world by 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) since the late 1800s, caused massive melting of ice globally, triggered weather extremes and changed ocean chemistry. And scientists say, depending on how much carbon dioxide is emitted, it will only get worse by the end of the century with temperatures jumping by several degrees and oceans rising by close to three feet (1 meter). Trump has been promising to pull out of the Paris deal since 2017, often mischaracterizing the terms of the agreement, which are voluntary. In October, he called it a massive wealth transfer from America to other nations and said it was one-sided That's not the case, experts said. For example, the U.S. goal  set by Barack Obama's administration  had been to reduce carbon dioxide emission in 2025 by 26% to 28% compared to 2005 levels. This translates to about 15% compared to 1990 levels. The European Union's goal was to cut carbon pollution in 2030 by 40% compared to 1990 levels, which is greater than America's pledge, said Stanford University's Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that track carbon emissions worldwide. The United Kingdom has already exceeded that goal, he said. ""The U.S. agreement is not a tax on the American people. There is no massive wealth transfer,"" said Climate Advisers CEO Nigel Purvis, who was a lead State Department climate negotiator in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. ""In fact, the agreement obligates no country to make any financial payments."" Formally getting out of the Paris agreement is bad, but at this point after years of rhetoric is more symbolic than anything, said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb. She said she is more worried about other Trump carbon pollution actions, such as fighting California's tougher emissions and mileage standards and rollbacks of coal fired power plant regulations. The U.S. was not on track to reach its Paris pledge, according to the federal Energy Information Administration's latest projections. The EIA projects that in 2025 emissions will be at 4959 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, 17% below 2005 levels, about 500 million tons short of the goal. Emissions in 2018 were nearly 2% higher than in 2016, the agency's latest energy outlook says. That spike likely was from extreme weather and economic growth, Marland and Jacoby said.",04/11/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/science/trump-can-begin-steps-to-pull-us-out-of-paris-climate-deal
United States begins process of withdrawing from Paris climate deal,"The United States submitted a formal notification that it will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday, a move that has been widely expected since President Trump announced his intention to do so in 2017. The climate agreement, which went into force Nov. 4, 2016, committed countries that signed the measure to take certain voluntary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement was not legally enforceable and countries set their own emissions targets. The accord banned countries from announcing their intent to withdraw in its first three years, meaning Monday was the first day the U.S. was allowed to submit its intent to leave the agreement since it went into force in 2016. ""President Trump made the decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement because of the unfair economic burden imposed on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers by U.S. pledges made under the Agreement,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""The United States has reduced all types of emissions, even as we grow our economy and ensure our citizens access to affordable energy."" LEONARDO DICAPRIO PRAISES GRETA THUNBERG AS 'A LEADER OF OUR TIME' Trump has previously said that the Paris climate agreement harms the U.S. economy and would hurt American jobs if left to stand. ""Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates,"" Trump said in the Rose Garden in 2017 when he announced plans to remove the U.S. from the accord. ""This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs  not what we need  believe me, this is not what we need  including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.  They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little."" Some opponents of the agreement have noted that countries such as Russia and China were not affected as significantly by the accord as the United States and pointed out the unencouraging results of the Kyoto Protocol, raising questions about whether the Paris agreement would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at all. GRETA THUNBERG TURNS DOWN ENVIRONMENTAL PRIZE, SAYS 'CLIMATE MOVEMENT DOES NOT NEED ANY MORE AWARDS' ""Half of the countries that were legally bound to the Kyoto Protocol treaty failed to adhere to their pledges, and the host country of Japan even increased their carbon emissions,"" Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said as the Paris climate agreement was being debated in 2016. ""Now we find ourselves celebrating an agreement where the worlds largest carbon emitter, China, is permitted to increase their emissions until 2025 and to continue bringing a coal-fired power plant online every 10 days. We even turn a blind eye to the fact that China lied about its carbon emissions when it first came to the table with its pledge last year."" Others, however, see America backing out of the international pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions as an abdication of global leadership and denial of basic climate science. ""By withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement to double-down on a coal &amp; fossil fuel energy agenda, Trump has engaged in a unilateral disarmament in the economic arms race that is the transition to clean energy,"" said Michael Mann, a climate scientist and professor at Penn State University. ""The challenge of averting dangerous and irreversible climate change and massive coastal inundation, devastating floods and droughts, is that much more an uphill climb with Trump's pullout from the Paris agreement.""  In his statement Monday, however, Pompeo maintained that the United States was on the right track both economically and environmentally. ""Our results speak for themselves,"" he wrote. ""U.S. emissions of criteria air pollutants that impact human health and the environment declined by 74 percent between 1970 and 2018. U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions dropped 13 percent from 2005-2017, even as our economy grew over 19 percent.""",04/11/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/united-states-begins-process-of-withdrawing-from-paris-climate-agreement
"Jane Fonda jabs Biden, says we only have '11 years to avoid catastrophe' on climate change","""View"" co-host Joy Behar and actress Jane Fonda had some dire warnings about climate change during Tuesday's show. ""Scientists are kind of nerdy and neutral, but even the scientists are saying, 'we're not going to be able to turn it around.' We have 11 years to avoid catastrophe,"" Fonda said, urging people to take to the streets in protest. Behar warned that because of President Trump rolling back Obama-era regulations, ""we're all going to be Flint, Mich., one of these days."" ""This guy is a convict on this topic,"" she said of Trump. Behar complained that the media didn't cover the issue of climate change enough, saying ""all we talk about is this impeachment issue."" She added that she watches ""CNN all day long"" and doesn't hear about the issue. ABBY HUNTSMAN CHALLNEGES JANE FONDA ON 'FANTASTIC' GREEN NEW DEAL: 'NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN' Fonda's appearance came after she was arrested multiple times during demonstrations surrounding climate change, saying the protests were meant to keep the issue on ""people's minds."" Fonda claimed that humans have ""never"" faced a dilemma like the threat posed by climate change. ""We are the last generation who can make the difference between life and death of the planet and whether the planet is habitable,"" Fonda said. ""That's right,"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg responded. Fonda added that if the U.S. had started addressing climate change ""30 years ago when the science was known ... it could have been an incremental, moderate transition off of fossil fuel."" DOOMSDAYS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN: THINK TANK COMPILES DECADES' WORTH OF DIRE CLIMATE PREDICTIONS The fossil fuel industry, Fonda added, created a situation where ""moderation"" wasn't an option in addressing climate change. Her comments came as 2020 presidential candidates proposed multitrillion-dollar climate change plans that endorsed the ""Green New Deal,"" an ambitious, emissions-reduction plan that has been criticized as unrealistic. Fonda, on Tuesday, praised the ""Green New Deal"" as ""fantastic"" and a path to avoiding catastrophe.  ""The 'Green New Deal' lays out a framework for how to move forward to a wonderful future,"" she said. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who endorsed the ""Green New Deal's"" framework, apparently wasn't progressive enough on climate change for Fonda. When Behar asked whether she supported Biden on the issue, Fonda refused to ""name names."" ""It should tell you something when I say it's too late for moderation,"" she said.",05/11/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jane-fonda-view-joe-biden-catastrophe-climate-change
The Arctic's most stable sea ice is vanishing alarmingly fast,"After climate change melts the Arctic Ocean's year-round ice cover, only the region's oldest, thickest ice will remain ... or will it? A new study offers a dire warning that even this ice is at risk. Known as the ""Last Ice Area,"" this icy zone extends more than 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) from Greenland's northern coast to the western part of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The enduring ice here is at least 5 years old  older than in neighboring regions  and measures about 13 feet (4 meters) thick. However, this older, more robust sea ice is not as stable as once thought, and it's vanishing much faster than expected. In fact, the Last Ice Area is disappearing about twice as rapidly as the Arctic's younger, thinner sea ice, researchers reported in a new study. Related: Images of Melt: See Earth's Vanishing Ice Much of the ice in the western Arctic is ""first-year ice""  ice that is no more than 1 year old, said lead study author Kent Moore, a physics professor with the University of Toronto Mississauga. ""The ice in the central Arctic is between 2 and 3 years old, and then the really old ice is in this Last Ice Area,"" Moore told Live Science. Sea ice cover in the Arctic grows and shrinks with the seasons, but recent years have seen less and less widespread ice, during both winter and summer months. In 2019, Arctic sea ice reached its maximum on March 13, spanning around 6 million square miles (15 million square kilometers). That extent is actually lower than most of the 40 previous years, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Arctic sea ice cover for 2019 reached its lowest on Sept 18. At 1.6 million square miles (4 million square km), this coverage tied with 2007 and 2016 as the second lowest since the 1970s, NASA reported. The prognosis for Arctic ice in a warming world is grim. Climate models predict that most of the ice outside of the Last Ice Area could vanish for good within the next few decades, leaving the Last Ice Area as the sole refuge for marine life that depends on ice, such as seals, polar bears and algae, Moore said. ""By the year 2060, the Arctic will be what people define as being ice-free, which is an area of perennial ice less than 1 million square kilometers [386,102 square miles]. And much of that ice will be in the Last Ice Area,"" he explained. Dynamic ice This ice was long thought to be fairly stationary, accumulating without much loss and locked in a location where it was undisturbed by wind and ocean currents. For the first time, scientists looked at the Last Ice Area using a model that reproduced the local ice cycle, incorporating satellite and atmospheric data from 1979 to 2018. The study authors found that the region was far more dynamic than previously suspected, and huge amounts of ice were being carried away into the ocean. ""What we found is from year to year, the ice thickness can change by about 1 meter [3 feet],"" Moore said. On average, ice thickness is about 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 m), but in some years it was less than 10 feet (3 m) and in other years it was greater than 16 feet (5 m). And when the ice becomes thinner  which is happening more frequently  it's easier for winds to carry it away, the scientists reported in the study. Related: 8 Ways Global Warming Is Changing the World They also learned that this area was thinning at an accelerated rate when compared with the rest of the Arctic. Since the late 1970s, two locations have seen their ice thickness drop by about 5 feet (2 m), the researchers wrote. ""We still don't know exactly why, but it's probably because the ice is now more mobile, and so it's able to leave this area more easily than it was in the past,"" Moore said. Climate change is heating things up in the Arctic at a rate that is unmatched anywhere else in the world. In June, the average temperature in the Arctic was warmer than the usual average by nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 degrees Celsius). Because climate models until now have likely underestimated ice loss from the Last Ice Area, it's possible that the Arctic will reach an ice-free state even more quickly than predicted, the study authors warned. And if Earth continues to warm, even the Last Ice Area won't stay frozen for much longer, Moore said. ""Eventually we'll lose ice in this region as well, if we don't get our use of carbon under control in the next few years,"" he said. ""We're going to pass a point where we won't be able to sustain these ecosystems, if the ice loss persists through the latter half of this century."" The findings were published online Oct. 15 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

"Venice suffers worst flooding in 50 years, mayor blames climate change","Venice is in a state of emergency as the Italian city deals with the aftermath of one of the worst floods in its history. Late on Tuesday (Nov. 12), high tides from the surrounding lagoon surged onto the more than 100 islands that make up Venice, flooding 85% of the city and damaging artwork and many historic sites, Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted. Photos and videos posted on social media show the intense flood turning alleyways into rushing rivers, stranding large water taxis in public plazas, and drenching some of the city's most iconic historic sites  including St. Mark's Basilica, completed in 1092. According to the local tide monitoring center, water levels from the flood peaked at 6.1 feet (1.87 meters) last night  the highest floodwaters in more than 50 years, and the second highest ever recorded in Venice. (The tide reached 6.3 feet, or 1.94 m, in November 1966.) Venice is susceptible to some flooding  or ""aqua alta,"" as it's regionally known  every year when high tides mix with heavy rain and strong winds. However, Brugnaro noted, yesterday's intense surge was exceptional, and almost certainly linked to the increasingly powerful storms fueled by global warming. ""These are the effects of climate change,"" Brugnaro tweeted. ""The costs will be high."" Of the 10 highest tides in Venice since record-keeping began in 1923, five have occurred in the last 20 years, including the current flood and one in 2018, BBC meteorologist Nikki Berry reported. Both events were tied to strong storm surges blowing northeastward across the Adriatic Sea (Venice is located on the northern seashore), thanks in part to changing patterns in the jet stream. These jet-stream patterns are likely to continue, leading to more frequent and intense storms, as climate change escalates, Berry wrote. That puts Venice  which is already sinking at a rate of a few millimeters per year  at risk of more annual damage like this. To mitigate this damage, the Italian government has been developing a series of barriers and floodgates known as the Mose Project since the 1980s. The project, which was first tested in 2013, has cost billions of euros and may finally be ready for implementation in 2021, the BBC reported. Two people have been reported dead from flood-related accidents since Tuesday. A man living on Pellestrina, one of the many islands that make up the Venetian lagoon, died of electrocution while attempting to start a water pump in his home. Another man was reported dead in his home in an unrelated incident. St. Mark's Basilica, the iconic cathedral sitting in Venice's central piazza, was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years (four of those floods occurred in the past 20 years, The Guardian reported). According to Brugnaro, the landmark suffered ""grave damage"" to its structural columns and the crypt was completely flooded. Water damage appears rampant through the city's many shops, hotels and landmarks. More ""very high"" tides and flooding are expected throughout the week, Venice's weather office said.

"Harvard-Yale climate change protest at football game sees 42 charged, officials say","A climate change protest at halftime of Harvard and Yales football game Saturday led to dozens of charges after the demonstration delayed the game. Officials said 42 people were charged with disorderly conduct due to the protest, during which students and alumni from both schools occupied midfield of the Yale Bowl during halftime. Some held signs demanding that Ivy League schools divest from the fossil fuel industry. Others had signs that raised issues about Puerto Rican debt and the treatment of the Uighurs of China. CLIMATE PROTESTERS DELAY HARVARD-YALE FOOTBALL GAME AFTER STAGING SIT-IN ON FIELD Most of the demonstrators walked off after about an hour but those who remained were charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and issued a court summons, Yale University said in a statement. Actor Sam Waterson was among those arrested. Yale officials said in a statement given to reporters in the press box at the game that the school stands firmly for the fight to free expression. It is regrettable that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual tradition when thousands gather from around the world to enjoy and celebrate the storied traditions of both football programs and universities, the statement said. COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF HAS 'DOUBLE STANDARD' WHEN HIT COMES TO GROUP OF 5 TEAMS, AAC COMMISH SAYS Rachel Sadoff, a junior at Harvard, told the Associated Press about 150 students planned to participate and about 100 more who were in the stands joined in. She said organizers considered the protest a success. Our goal was to spread the word, Sadoff said. If more people speak up, our colleges will have to listen. Sidney Carlson-White, a Yale student and Fossil Free Yale spokesperson, told The Washington Post the protest was thrilling. This is an absolutely thrilling experience, and were very excited about the support that it garnered from all over, Carlson-White said. GEORGIA STUDENT-PHOTOGRAPHER HURT IN SCARY COLLISION WITH PLAYER SHARES PHOTO SHE TOOK BEFORE TACKLE Chuck Crummie, 68, who attended the game with his son expressed his displeasure with the protest.

Harvard student blasts climate change protesters for delaying Harvard-Yale football game with 'empty activism',"More than 150 climate change protesters stormed the field at the Harvard-Yale football game Saturday, causing a 40-minute delay. The protesters, two dozen of whom were arrested, demanded that both Ivy League schools stop funding fossil fuel companies  an act Christopher Colby, a Harvard student and Campus Reform correspondent, blasted as ""empty activism"" and par for the course on a liberal campus. CLIMATE PROTESTERS DELAY HARVARD-YALE FOOTBALL GAME AFTER STAGING SIT-IN ON FIELD ""These protesters decided that their version of empty activism for this weekend was going to go sit in the middle of the field, during the game, right in the middle of it, wasting everybody's time,"" Colby told ""Fox &amp; Friends"" Monday. ""I have to say most people were pretty nonplussed. The protest was pretty poorly planned."" However, Caleb Schwartz, a Harvard student and spokesman for the group Divest Harvard, told ESPN the protest was a result of months of coordination. ""This is a very deliberate choice of targeting this specific [game] to get our action out there,"" Schwartz told ESPN's Paul Kix. Colby argued that protesters' demands would hurt the students who need financial aid the most, including many of protesters themselves, ""because they wouldn't have funding to go to school anymore."" ""Most of my friends were just irked, very annoyed that they got their time taken away from them, but our biggest takeaway, for the most part, was just that this was another empty political activist thing liberals tend to do on big days,"" Colby said. ""It's really quite annoying. I don't think the protest accomplished much."" BOSTON UNIVERSITY STUDENT SAYS BEN SHAPIRO PROTESTERS SHOWED 'INTOLERANCE' ON CAMPUS Harvard lost 50-43 in double-overtime, but Colby said the ""Divest protest didn't help"" the historically long game. Yale referred to the protest as ""regrettable"" in a statement, saying the Ivy League ""stands firmly for the right to free expression"" but took issue with how the protesters went about it, adding, ""we do not allow disruption of university events."" The protest received support from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who tweeted ""Activism disrupts the present to change the future,"" but many online mocked the protest saying it could only happen at an Ivy League game. The incident was just the latest in a series of climate demonstrations that erupted in the fall. Protesters held sit-ins in the offices of both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, demanding more aggressive action on climate change. Actress Jane Fonda has participated in several protests, including one on Friday that resulted in multiple arrests.  Climate change has gained more attention as 2020 Democrats candidates shone a spotlight on the issue and President Trump filed paperwork to officially withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.

""I'll make big investments in American research, American industry, and American workers."" The ad came as other leading 2020 candidates narrowed their focus on climate change for Iowa, which relies on agriculture and has been beset by severe floods in recent years. Both Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reportedly honed in on the issue. Climate change has become a prominent issue in Democratic debates, with CNN hosting a town hall devoted solely to asking what candidates would do about the issue. BIDEN RETAKES LEAD IN NEW POLL AS WARREN'S NUMBERS PLUMMET, BUTTIGIEG GAINS GROUND In the ad, Warren touted her plans for addressing climate change and promised to ""create more than a million good jobs here at home."" ""I'm Elizabeth Warren. I approved this message and I'm not afraid to fight to get this done,"" she said, concluding the ad. In June, Warren proposed a series of ideas with a nod to the goals of the Green New Deal advanced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

Her ad was released on the same day that the United Nations urged dramatic action to reduce emissions and meet the temperature reduction goal set in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.  Trump provoked progressive condemnation when he announced that he would abandon that deal -- a decision he made in consideration of the impact on the U.S. economy.

UN report: World already far behind progress needed to reach Paris climate goals,"The United Nations offered what it called ""bleak"" findings Tuesday as it warned that the world was headed toward global ""extinction"" and would need to increase its efforts ""fivefold"" if nations wanted to reach the temperature reduction goal outlined in the Paris climate agreement. According to the report, global temperatures are set to rise by 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century -- a significantly higher target than Paris' 1.5 degrees. In order to bridge the gap, the U.N. called for a 7.6 percent per year reduction in emissions between 2020 and 2030. ""Failure to heed these warnings and take drastic action to reverse emissions means we will continue to witness deadly and catastrophic heatwaves, storms and pollution,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned in a press release. The U.N. warned that the expected temperature increase would translate into ""mass extinctions. Large parts of the planet would be uninhabitable."" CLIMATE ACTIVISTS TURN UP THE HEAT ON ELECTED DEMS, CRITICIZE INACTION The report came as the debate around climate change began to intensify and the United States officially filed paperwork to remove itself from the 2015 Paris agreement. Progressives, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have called for sweeping reforms, arguing that the cost of inaction outweighs the cost of transforming the economy. Conservatives, meanwhile, have warned about economic consequences and pointed to failed, historical climate predictions as reasons for avoiding drastic change. While cost estimates for climate plans have varied considerably, the U.N. called for the U.S. to spend between $1.6 trillion and $3.8 trillion annually on energy investments for the next 30 years. That would mean spending as much as $114 trillion by 2050. The report proposed action on ""rapid decarbonization of the energy system,"" expanding renewable energy, and avoiding future emissions. ""Any transition at this scale is likely to be extremely challenging and will meet a number of economic, political and technical barriers and challenges,"" the report acknowledges. WORLD'S THICKEST MOUNTAIN GLACIER IS MELTING, NEW NASA IMAGES REVEAL The report will likely fall on deaf ears in the White House, which has already indicated it's not willing to risk the economic costs of reform. Democrats in Congress have already pushed bills geared toward reducing emissions but D.C. gridlock has made passage unlikely. In the U.S., the Green New Deal, which aims to achieve Paris' temperature reduction goal, has become a model for leading progressive politicians to pursue in order to address climate change. The right-leaning Heritage Foundation tried using a government model for predicting the economic cost of reaching Ocasio-Cortez's emissions goal through carbon taxes. It crashed and showed that just a 58 percent reduction would, by 2040, cost the economy $15 trillion in lost gross domestic product and an average of 1.1 million jobs per year. The average family of four would also see a total income loss of $165,000, or nearly $8,000 each year.  The U.N., like U.S. progressives, argued the economic benefits of energy transformation would be enormous. ""Analysis by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate estimates that ambitious climate action could generate $26 trillion in economic benefits between now and 2030 and create 65 million jobs by 2030, while avoiding 700,000 premature deaths from air pollution,"" the report claimed.",26/11/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/science/un-report-paris-behind-climate-goals
"Climate protesters block stores, disrupt Black Friday shopping","Protesters around the world disrupted Black Friday shopping in order to draw attention to climate change days before the United Nations met to discuss the issue in Madrid. The retail holiday saw protests in a long list of countries -- including France, Germany, the United States -- with some activists entering stores and others holding mock funerals. Near Paris, climate demonstrators blocked a shopping mall and gathered in from of Amazons headquarters to protest over-production they say is killing the planet. To many activists, Black Friday is the epitome of this shift, a purely commercial event designed to boost U.S. retailers ahead of the Christmas holidays, the symbol of capitalism run amok. ""We are living in a system of endless consumerism,"" the group Extinction Rebellion NYC tweeted on Friday. ""Earth cannot sustain that, especially as we accelerate towards climate and ecological catastrophe."" HARVARD-YALE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTEST AT FOOTBALL GAME SEES 42 CHARGED, OFFICIALS SAY The group posted photos and videos purportedly showing activists protesting the holiday. Protesters also reportedly shut down streets in Vancouver, Canada for a mock funeral procession. The Sunrise Movement, a group that's helped promote the Green New Deal, swarmed the large Water Tower Place shopping mall in Chicago. CLIMATE ACTIVISTS TURN UP THE HEAT ON ELECTED DEMS, CRITICIZE INACTION In Washington, D.C., actress Jane Fonda led yet another protest as part of a series called ""Fire Drill Fridays."" In a post retweeted by Fonda, the group cliamed that ""38 people were arrested demanding food justice."" Activists also reportedly planned to hold a ""Black Friday Funeral for the Future"" on Capitol Hill in order to ""eulogize and mourn all that has been lost and all that is threatened by the climate crisis. Climate change protests seemed to intensify in the fall with thousands skipping school during September's climate strike. Activist Greta Thunberg also appeared at a United Nations meeting where she vehemently denounced politicians for inaction on climate change. And last week, nearly 260 groups sent a letter requesting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Ill., pursue policies like the Green New Deal instead of ""incremental or isolated policy tweaks."" HARVARD STUDENT BLASTS CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS FOR DELAYING HARVARD-YALE FOOTBALL GAME WITH 'EMPTY ACTIVISM' According to The Washington Post, the group Extinction Rebellion held a hunger strike in an attempt to force the speaker into a video-recorded meeting. When they realized she was planning to leave D.C., the protesters attempted to storm past her office's entrance and into a broader room where her chief of staff sat. Also last week, climate protesters delayed a Harvard-Yale football game when they occupied the field and demanded the Ivy League schools divest from the fossil fuel industry. The disruptions will likely continue as the United Nations meets to discuss the issue in Madrid on Monday. The United Nations offered what it called ""bleak"" findings Tuesday as it warned that the world was headed toward global ""extinction"" and would need to increase its efforts ""fivefold"" if nations wanted to reach the temperature reduction goal outlined in the Paris climate agreement. AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS HIT MAJOR CITIES IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, MORE THAN 300 ARRESTED The United States recently filed paperwork to officially remove itself from the multilateral agreement. Conservatives, meanwhile, have warned about economic consequences of large-scale reform and pointed to failed, historical climate predictions as reasons for avoiding drastic change. According to AP, Quang Paasch of the activist group Fridays for Future said governments attending next weeks annual climate conference should keep in mind the goals of the 2015 Paris accord, which set a target of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). We need to keep taking to the streets, we need to defend Paris.  In Berlin, about two dozen environmental activists jumped into the chilly waters of the Spree river in front of parliament to protest a government-backed package of measures they say wont be enough to reduce the countrys greenhouse gas emissions. The package was blocked Friday by Germanys upper house, which represents the countrys 16 states. Later, tens of thousands of students rallied in front of the Brandenburg Gate.

"Massive animals in Australia died from humans and climate change, study says","Nearly 42,000 years ago, massive animals such as 6-foot-tall birds, 23-foot long lizards and wombat-like creatures the size of a Buick could be seen roaming the countryside. But a new study has found that these megafaunas became extinct because of human intervention and climate change. The researchers, led by Dr. Frederik Saltre of Flinders University, used a variety of techniques to find human migration patterns in Australia. We developed a complex mathematical technique to solve the problems of averaging timelines over landscapes, he told Fox News. Our approach extends the information provided by radiocarbon-dated fossils from the extinct species themselves, and archaeological evidence from early Aboriginal people, [and] this way we can create unbiased maps of both the timings of megafauna extinctions and human arrival across the landscape. BEES ARE ABLE TO 'SURF' WHEN THEY'RE STUCK IN WATER, STUDY SAYS Based on these new maps, the team of researchers was able to estimate the regions where humans and megafauna coexisted (for example, New South Wales and north of South Australia), and where they did not (south of Victoria, Tasmania, etc.). We then used sophisticated spatial computer models to analyze what conditions  changing temperature, precipitation, freshwater availability, proportion of desert, plant coverage, and the arrival of people  best explained the timing of megafauna extinctions across the landscape, Saltre added. With most of Australia being arid, freshwater was a high priority for megafauna and humans, with its availability being one of the main reasons for peoples migration patterns. Humans and megafauna would inevitably interact at watering holes, leaving the giant animals vulnerable to hunting, further dwindling their numbers. In other areas where humans werent around to hunt the creatures or use up their resources, the megafauna eventually succumbed to the increasingly dry climate, which killed off the vegetation. According to Saltre, unlike today, these ancient humans did not have an impact on the big dry-out. In regions like Tasmania and south of South Australia and Victoria, humans never coexisted with megafauna because they migrated across these areas after the megafauna had already gone extinct, he explained. This rules humans out as the likely driver of megafauna extinction in those regions only, but a closer look at climate change during this extinction event in these areas showed that megafauna species might have suffered from a lack of food availability in the form of plants  most of the species that went extinct were plant-eaters. NILE MILLIONS OF YEARS OLDER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, STUDY SAYS So why was the role of humans in the demise of the Australian megafauna so heavily debated over the years? According to Saltre, up until now, the main ways researchers looked into the causes of megafauna extinction were to build timelines of major events: when the species went extinct; when people arrived; and when the climate changed. However, because there are so few fossilized animal specimens in Australia due to the continents harsh conditions, reliable data is scarce. Some studies have been restricted to making conclusions at the scale of single paleontological sites, or of specific archaeological sites, while other studies have taken the opposite approach by including evidence from across the entire continent. Unfortunately, this lumping of the available evidence across many different sites ignores the fact that different conditions might be causing extinctions in different combinations depending on where you are in the landscape, Saltre said. He continued: This is like either having too few pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to be able to see the big picture (single sites), or being able to see the big picture, but only a fuzzy, pixelated version of it (landscape averaging). Our new approach takes the best of both worlds, because we have now access to all the pieces of the puzzle to unveil the big picture at a good resolution. The study can be found in Nature Communications. ",06/12/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/science/massive-animals-australia-died-humans-climate-change
"Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Benji Backer: How to depolarize the climate change debate","For too long, the climate change debate in Washington, D.C, has circled around who denies what and when the world may end. On Twitter and other social media, the debate has turned eating a hamburger or vegetable into a partisan argument. Climate change has become a polarizing, partisan topic. It shouldnt be. On one hand, Republicans have done a poor job explaining how our free-market clean energy solutions are climate solutions. On the other hand, the Democratic Party has seemingly aimed to out-radicalize itself every day with increasingly alarmist and unrealistic climate change proposals that stand no chance of becoming law. The Green New Deal, or most ideas from Democratic presidential primary candidates, only turn away necessary voices and push aside potential feasible policies. While science doesnt say we only have 12 years to save our climate, its undeniable that humans impact our naturally ever-changing environment. JIM BRESLO: CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS PURSUE WRONG POLICIES TO REDUCE FIRES  THEY SHOULD DO THIS So whats a realistic policy? It wont come from one single piece of legislation, but from many free-market solutions that unleash American ingenuity and leadership. Its these solutions that create jobs, clean up the environment for future generations, and build consensus around the common ground to care for the world around us. Take, for example, Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT). Its a clean building product that proves innovation is how we can combat climate change, grow the economy, and raise our standard of living. It emits fewer emissions to manufacture than other tall building products and acts as a carbon-capture product. Its estimated that the use of CLT and other mass timber for the construction of tall buildings could reduce emissions by up to 20 percent. It will also stimulate economic growth in Americas rural, timber-dependent communities. Congresswoman Rodgers has also prioritized hydropower as a source of clean energy for her district, promoted carbon-neutral biomass, and helped mitigate catastrophic forest fires that contribute to climate change. She has also led on streamlining relicensing processes to spur the development of clean energy resources and passed bipartisan legislation to encourage the use of small conduit hydropower projects to diversify our clean energy portfolio. Last Congress, she introduced a bill that focused on modernizing hydropower  which powers 70 percent of Washington state  and it passed in the House with strong bipartisan support. On the grassroots side, the American Conservation Coalition has built a presence on 180 college campuses nationwide, helped form the Republican Partys first bicameral environmentally-focused caucus, and brought countless conservative students to Capitol Hill advocating for important climate and energy reforms. In September, we testified with Greta Thunberg before Congress on the importance of pragmatic climate change solutions. Were changing the narrative that conservatives dont care about the environment by building a strong base on these issues. The climate is changing. Humans and global industrial activity are contributing. Thankfully, there are realistic free-market solutions that will lead us in the right direction. For too long, this debate has centered on politicians pointing fingers to the other side. For Americans looking for solutions, its an old and boring story  and we agree. Its time for something new and bold leadership on ideas that work. Climate change should no longer be partisan  or generational. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The climate is changing. Humans and global industrial activity are contributing. Thankfully, there are realistic free-market solutions that will lead us in the right direction. Solutions like CLT and hydropower are already here, and there are more innovations to come that will ensure America leads on clean energy, creating jobs, keeping energy prices affordable, and reducing carbon emissions.  Why not promote what raises our standard of living today and helps us leave our home better off than we found it? With solutions and results that benefit everyone, thats a no-brainer. Its also far more productive than the time wasted on partisan talking points, especially when technology and innovation are already making a difference. This is a global problem, and it requires both parties leading on a global solution. America led the world in the development of coal, oil and gas, and now we can lead the world in clean energy technology.

Bloomberg calls for closing all coal-fired power plants to combat climate change,"Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is calling for a 50 percent reduction in carbon emissions over the next 10 years to battle climate change. To achieve that goal, the former New York City mayor and multi-billionaire business and media mogul on Friday unveiled a plan that would shutter all 251 remaining coal plants across the country by 2030 and replace them all with clean energy. He would also phase out gas-fired power plants. BLOOMBERG'S MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR MEDIA BLITZ ISN'T PAYING OFF IMMEDIATELY WITH VOTERS At a speech in Alexandria, Va., Bloomberg warned that ""we have to start working as hard as we can building a 100 percent clean energy economy because the alternative is just too bad for all of us."" Standing at a podium with an END COAL 2030 campaign banner, he highlighted his goals  ensuring 80 percent clean electricity by the end of his second term in the White House, and moving the country toward 100 percent clean energy by 2045 or 2050. Among the first steps Bloomberg says hell take if hes elected president would be ending all subsidies for fossil fuels, implementing stringent carbon and health pollutant standards for new gas plants, and putting a halt to construction of a new generation of fossil-fuel power plants. Bloomberg also pledges to prioritize communities that have suffered most from coal pollution or have been left behind in the transition to clean energy. In announcing his plan, Bloomberg is taking aim at President Trump, criticizing the GOP incumbent for a lack of commitment to tackling climate change. The president refuses to lead on climate change, so the rest of us must. Ive been all-in on this fight for more than a decade - and having helped close more than half the nation's dirty coal plants, having cut New York City's carbon footprint by 14 percent, having led a coalition of cities, states, and businesses committed to the Paris Agreement, I know that we can win, Bloomberg said. Weve proven that you can transition to clean energy and strengthen the economy at the same time. As president, I'll accelerate our transition to a 100 percent clean energy economy, he said. BLOOMBERG'S DOCTOR SAYS CANDIDATE'S IN 'OUTSTANDING HEALTH' Trump vowed to save the coal industry as he campaigned for president in the 2016 election. The presidents had mixed success in the White House in following through on his pledge. But openly targeting the industry remains politically risky in certain swing states, including Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Bloomberg also said he would ""quadruple our investment in research and development across multiple federal agencies to work with the private sector to unlock more private capital for clean energy investment and work on sustainable development. And we also have to end the war on science that the Trump Administration is waging."" Asked by Fox News about the price tag for his proposals, Bloomberg said: ""I dont know how you could possibly estimate the cost of something that is going to stretch out to 2050. No economist or mathematician is good enough to do those calculations."" Bloombergs poured millions of his own money to fund the effort to fight climate change. The candidate, whos made the issue a central pillar of his presidential campaign, spoke in person at the beginning of this week at a United Nations global climate conference in Spain, while the official U.S. delegation kept a lower profile at the gathering. On Wednesday, Bloomberg teamed up with former Gov. Jerry Brown in California as part of the efforts of America's Pledge, a coalition of governors, mayors, leaders in the business world, and others focusing on meeting global climate goals. Climate change has been one of the leading issues in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. It was a top issue for Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, who dropped his White House bid earlier this autumn. And it's a top issue for current candidate Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and organizer.",13/12/2019,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bloomberg-calls-for-closing-all-coal-and-gas-fired-power-plants-to-combat-climate-change
Polar bears birthing could be disrupted by warming climate,"Newborn polar bears are able to survive the bone-chilling Arctic winter -- where temperatures can fall to negative 30 degrees Celsius or lower -- by seeking warmth in their mothers' dens. However, new research claims that if current trends continue, cubs along Alaska's northern coast might perish outside instead. The study, presented at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union this month, suggests that mother polar bears may no longer be able to locate the deep snowbanks they need to dig dens by the end of this century. They need that habitat to give birth, Megan Liu, a research intern who presented the findings, told Inside Science. Their analysis indicates that if we don't restrict our emissions, very soon, within the century, there's going to be an extended amount of time when there's no available denning habitat for the polar bears. Their work focuses on the Beaufort Sea coast, where declines in sea ice are hitting bears hard -- as previous research has shown. NASA'S HUBBLE SPOTS STUNNING 'PINWHEELING' GALAXY MASSIVE ASTEROID WILL ZOOM PAST EARTH JUST AFTER CHRISTMAS Although scientists have been aware of the impact climate change has on polar bears for years, the majority of the studies have focused on losing their sea ice hunting grounds, Steven Amstrup, who oversaw polar bear research for the U.S. Geological Survey for three decades, explained to Inside Science. Some areas of the Arctic are warming at a slower rate than others, but Armstrup, who was not involved with the study, said the trend could impact areas besides the northern coast of Alaska. Ultimately every place is going to be warmer, Amstrup told Inside Science. If we don't halt global warming, ultimately all polar bear habitat will be impacted.

"Daniel Turner: If climate change is an existential threat, as Democrats claim, then THIS is our only option","Of the multiple challenges facing our nation, only one has been called ""an existential crisis,"" repeatedly and unanimously, by all the leading Democratic presidential candidates.    Not terrorism, threats from a nuclear Iran, or the ongoing quagmire in Afghanistan.    Not a raging opioid epidemic that claims 70,000 American lives every year.   DANIEL TURNER: REJOICE IN AMERICA'S ENERGY BOOM  AND DON'T LET DEMOCRATS TAKE IT AWAY IN 2020 No, the crisis that threatens our very existence, the life of mankind, is climate change.    ""This is our World War II,"" opined New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. ""I think it will be harder to tackle,"" said Mayor Pete Buttegeig, comparing the climate issue to the mobilization of millions of American boys across Europe and the Pacific.    CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER ""Existential threat"" is a grave phrase and, at least for the sake of this article, I will take these Democrats at their word that this is a deeply held belief and not merely campaign jargon.    The only way to face an existential threat is to kill it before it kills you. Otherwise, it is not a threat. And certainly not ""existential.""  During World War II, America did not face the existential threat of Hitler by fighting Nazis at home. We did not face down the existential threat of the Cold War with speeches. When Muslim extremists brought existential violence to our nation on 9/11, we took the fight to them.   No. In every existential threat we have faced, we brought war, and millions of men and women have served, some paying the ultimate price. Enacting the radical ""Green New Deal,"" which all the Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed, is not enough as the threat is global.  That was the purpose of the Paris Climate Accord: bind us all to the same resolution and conscript us to the duty of eradication.     What country is leading the global existential threat? China.   China is the worlds leading polluter of air and ocean. It is the worlds leader in CO2 emissions and has no intention of decreasing them.    Democratic candidates speak of oil, gas and coal the way Churchill spoke of fascism. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have vowed ""on my first day"" to ban fracking, fossil fuel development on federal land, and offshore drilling. War with China, then, is an absolutely essential component of addressing the climate crisis if, indeed, it is existential. We cannot stand by and their actions contribute to the death of all humanity.    No one wants war. No young men wanted to storm the beaches of Normandy, but they did it because the crisis was existential. So, if not a military war with China, surely the presidential candidates would support at minimum a trade war. China producing less means they would pollute less and that is essential in combating climate change. Yet, the Democrats running for president oppose the tariffs currently crippling Chinas economy.    ""The world is going to end in 12 years if we dont address climate change,"" AOC said earlier this year.  That, too, is a serious claim. Whats a serious response?      Sanders supports population control and using taxpayer dollars for abortions in ""poor"" countries. If people feed the climate change virus, the reasoning goes, then we need fewer people in the world.   But people are not really the problem, other candidates suggest, consumers are. So, we must cut back on consumption, and therefore we see proposals for limiting the amount of meat people consume, banning cars, air travel and of course, plastic straws. Eliminate consumer goods and we fight climate change.    Democratic candidates advocate for much more. They speak of oil, gas and coal the way Churchill spoke of fascism. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have vowed ""on my first day"" to ban fracking, fossil fuel development on federal land, and offshore drilling.  ""Middle-class Joe"" Biden from Pennsylvania, which employs hundreds of thousands of energy workers, has declared, ""There is no place in my administration for fossil fuels"".   Lets hope a Commander in Chief Biden wouldnt extend this sophomoric affirmation to the military and have our Navys ships powered by sails.   The real mission of the Democratic candidates, and most environmental leftists, is this: punish Americans. Even though climate change is a global problem, and China is the leading cause, we will eliminate freedoms, reduce market choices, curtail prosperity, and most egregiously, destroy jobs. Americans must suffer because China pollutes.     Americans have a choice: take these candidates at their word or consider it all political blathering. If the latter, these candidates can be ignored.  But if the former, we must prepare for war. After all, climate change is an existential threat.    Isnt it?

Liberty Vittert: End climate change zealotry ???ancor prevents progress on the real issues,"The Royal Statistical Society announced the Statistic of the Decade as 8.4 million. The estimated accumulated deforestation of the Amazon rainforest over the past decade is equivalent to around 8.4 million soccer fields (about 10.3 million football fields). That is the size of Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey and Massachusetts. We  Im a member of the judging panel  also decided to have a highly commended statistic of the decade of 19 percent. The global death rate from air pollution fell by 19 percent over the past decade (and by over 42 percent since 1990). While whether we are doing enough to curb pollution remains a fiercely contested topic, we decided that it was important to shine a light on the fact that there are certainly positive developments. While many may think that air quality is getting worse, the number of deaths caused by air pollution has actually fallen. LEE EDWARDS: 4 MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS OF COLD WAR  AND WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT TODAY And I think these two statistics chosen by the Royal Statistical Society actually highlight the crux of the issue with environmental concerns, pollution and climate change as a whole. The deforestation of the Amazon is a very serious issue. Any short-term financial gain is absolutely blown out of the water by the long-term financial and environmental loss. But the environment and climate change are complicated issues and by only focusing on the impending doom (of which there is certainly truth), we tend to ignore, and in fact, brush off the positive developments. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The level of religious fervor surrounding the environment, and specifically climate change, has made scientific discourse almost impossible. I wrote an article last summer simply asking for the calls of death in 12 years and hottest month ever to be halted in exchange for a less sensationalized view of the climate crisis (of which I firmly believe there is one). I was ridiculed by many of my scientific peers, my credentials were called into question, and I was actually called disgusting by a statistician I used to work with.  And Im small fries! Freeman Dyson, one of the most famous and well-respected physicists of his generation (with 21 honorary degrees from universities like Georgetown, Princeton and Oxford), was ostracized by his former community for simply questioning some of the climate change forecasts.  Are Dysons assertions correct? No idea, but I think he deserves to be listened to. And Dyson isnt the only one. By dogmatically ignoring any positive changes, and sensationalizing the negative ones, I dont see how we can realistically move forward in addressing the actual issues that are and will be occurring due to climate change. I mean, come on, I recently read an article in the Atlantic saying that climate change deniers are the equivalent of racists.  If we have any hope of stopping the very real and significant climate issues we face, we have to remove the political element, reduce the religious fervor, and come together over the issues instead of participating in the dismissal culture (on both sides). The deforestation of the Amazons effect on the environment is the international statistic of the decade for a reason: it has terrible consequences. But, I believe the Royal Statistical Society was also correct to highlight the 19 percent drop in the death rate from air pollution.

Top 5 most outrageous 2020 doomsday predictions that didn't pan out,"Will the world end in 12 years? Maybe 30? If history is any guide, it will not. Many similar predictions have been made in the past, but they came and went without tragedy. Here are the five worst predictions made about 2020 that failed to pan out. 1. The U.S. may warm 6 degrees F from 1990 to 2020 In 1990, The Washington Post reported in a front page story: ""Carbon dioxide is the gas most responsible for predictions that Earth will warm on average by about 3 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2020."" The outlet further warned: ""The United States, because it occupies a large continent in higher latitudes, could warm by as much as 6 degrees Fahrenheit."" 2019 IN REVIEW: THE TOP 5 CRAZIEST WEATHER MOMENTS Thirty years later, 2020 has finally arrived. The Earth has warmed approximately 1 degree Fahrenheit according to NASA. The United States also warmed roughly 1 degree. Elliott Negin, a spokesman for the Union of Concerned Scientists, declined to comment. The latest UN IPCC report, AR5, however, addresses the issue of whether their models were accurate. (The UN predictions differed from the 1990 Washington Post ones, which did not cite its source.) The latest UN report shows that current temperatures are just within the UNs old predictions made in 1990, but acknowledges that actual temperatures came in on the lower end of expectations. The UN report partly credits a 1991 volcanic eruption in the Philippines for the lower-than-expected warming, and says the new models account for volcanoes. The UN now predicts a rise of about 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit from today to the year 2100. 2. Oil will effectively run out by 2020 CNN ran a headline in 2003 titled ""World oil and gas 'running out'"". The New York Times reported in 1989 that ""untapped pools of domestic oil are finite and dwindling,"" and that ""William Stevens, the president of Exxon U.S.A., said ... by the year 2020 there would not be enough domestic oil left 'to keep me interested.'"" But doomsayers underestimated American ingenuity, and the opposite happened. Both U.S. oil output and U.S. proven oil reserves are dramatically higher now than they were in 1989, thanks to technology allowing deeper oil to be discovered and extracted. New technology in natural gas (""fracking"") also allowed the U.S. to become an energy independent net oil exporter for the first time in 75 years in 2018. Reached by phone, Phillip Shabecoff, the former New York Times reporter who covered the disappearing oil in 1989, said that the Exxon CEOs 2020 prediction was off. Im not Nostradamus, he said, adding, its what the Exxon CEO said. He obviously did not anticipate the new fracking and gas technology. At the time the Permean Basin was being drained dry, so he had every reason to believe we were running out of oil, Shabecoff said. Marian Tupy, who tracks metrics like oil production at HumanProgress.org, told Fox News that people routinely underestimate humanity. People only think about how can we solve things with current technology. They underestimate human ingenuity, he said. Shabecoff said that unfortunately, human ingenuity is often undermined by political ideology and greed, so we have not been able to bring human ingenuity to bear on urgent questions like climate change. 3) By 2020, no glaciers will be left on Mt. Kilimanjaro ""It's now estimated that by the year 2020, there will be no glaciers of Mt. Kilimanjaro,"" Christian Lambrechts, an officer at the U.N. Environment Program, told CNN in 2003. The Associated Press also reported in 2007 that in 2001, [glaciologist Lonnie] Thompson predicted the snows of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania would disappear within the next 20 years. But today, Kilimanjaro's glaciers are still there, according to a 2019 paper in the Journal Ecology and Evolution that includes photos and a new timetable: ""most of glaciers on Kilimanjaro ... will most likely disappear within 25 years."" Lonnie Thompson defended his prediction and said it was a bit different from how the AP summarized it. My prediction was that there would be no glaciers, and that is true, he told Fox News by phone. What we have now are ice bodies. The definition of a glacier is ice in motion. To be ice in motion, you have to have an accumulation zone. Theres been no recent accumulation. There are no glaciers on Kilimanjaro, he said. Asked about the study calling the current snow on the mountain glaciers, he said: Sometimes people get caught up in semantics. The fact is all the glaciers in the tropics are disappearing. 4. A billion people will starve due to missing the tech revolution In 2000, Discover Magazine published a largely spot-on list of predictions about 2020.                                                 But it missed big when predicting a ""grisly reality"" of tech-caused inequality: ""For [virtual reality pioneer Jaron] Lanier, the most heartbreaking scenario is festering in the third world, where, he believes, the current generation ... will be lost in the next techno-revolution ... You're going to have to somehow live while you watch a billion people starve...'"" But from 2000 to 2020, global extreme poverty fell by about a billion people, according to the World Bank, as technology connected the world and allowed people in developing nations to access capital, production know-how, and aid from developed countries.  Lanier told Fox News that his prediction was really more about how poverty would be more in your face due to technology and said that the developing world could still collapse by, say, 2030. It is true that poverty has fallen... but the developing world is headed towards a reckoning. I still worry about Lagos [Nigeria] in 2030. Look at the population projections. Where will the water come from?... he said. Ill stand by what I said for now, but I still hope to be proven wrong, he added. 5. By 2020, ""millions will die"" from climate change Reuters newswire ran this headline in 1997: ""'Millions will die' unless climate policies change."" The report said 8 million people would die by 2020, citing a prediction in the Lancet medical journal. The mass death prediction was clearly way off. None of these predictions came true, and aren't even close to coming true, said Roy Spencer, a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's amazing that the public can continue to believe apocalyptic predictions despite a 95 percent decline in weather-related deaths in the last 100 years. Some modern studies claim to find mass deaths; the Daily Beast covered a shock report that Climate Change Kills 400,000 a Year, but Human Progress' Marian Tupy said such estimates are grossly inflated. They say climate change causes everything. Some people try to pin the war on Syria on climate change, and then say when all those people die, that's because of climate change. They have a secondary agenda, Tupy said. The five predictions highlighted here join a host of similar failed predictions for 2010 and 2015 that Fox News tracked. Tupy said that an overly negative view of humanity may be one cause of the bad predictions. Humans are not a curse upon the planet, but are actually a benefit, because we are problem-solvers. We are creators, not destroyers, on average. When people ask you when was the best time to be alive  the answer is, tomorrow, he added.

CNN pushes climate change in report on park removing signs saying glaciers would disappear by 2020,"CNN published a report on Wednesday about Glacier National Park removing signs that warned the glaciers would be gone by 2020, but strangely continued to push man-made climate change despite the park's dire prediction being wrong. A spokesperson for the Glacier National Park told CNN that the over decade-old signs were placed after the US Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that the existing glaciers at the Montana park would be depleted by 2020 due to climate change projections. The USGS, however, told the park in 2017 that it was no longer expecting that the glaciers would disappear by the new decade ""due to changes in the forecast model"" but weren't removed until now because ""tight maintenance budgets"" prevented the removal of the signs. The spokesperson told CNN that the signs would be revised and will instead state, ""When they will completely disappear depends on how and when we act. One thing is consistent: the glaciers in the park are shrinking."" CNN SETTLES NICK SANDMANN DEFAMATION LAWSUIT IN COVINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL CONTROVERSY But as conservative site NewsBusters pointed out, the incorrect forecast didn't stop CNN from ""hyping"" climate change in its report. ""Humans are responsible, scientist says,"" CNN wrote in a large font in the middle of its report. The report goes on to cite a 2017 study from USGS and Portland State University that concluded that ""some of the ice formations in Montana had lost 85% of their size and the average shrinkage was 39%."" The study's lead scientist warned that ""in several decades they will be mostly gone"" and that they will ""certainly be gone"" by the end of the century.  CNN then points to several other glacier studies from around the world, all showing shrinkage in recent years. ""This is propaganda, not news,"" NewsBusters research analyst Joseph Vazquez reacted. ""If youre CNN, youd just be looking to push one side of the story (the climate alarmist side that is), even when your own reporting undercuts your preferred position.""",09/01/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-climate-change-glacier-national-park
Colorado climate change protesters arrested for demonstration at State Capitol,"At least 38 people were arrested and forced out of the Colorado State Capitol on Thursday for urging climate change action during the annual State of the State address. Numerous protesters, many affiliated with the Extinction Rebellion and Sunrise movements, were seen being dragged out of the building in handcuffs. They were taken into custody on charges of trespassing, disrupting a lawful assembly and obstruction of a peace officer, according to the Denver Police Department. COLORADO DINER CHARGES CUSTOMER FOR 'STUPID QUESTION,' RECEIPT SHOWS Just minutes before Colorado Gov. Jared Polis arrived at the House of Representatives in Denver, some protesters in the upper chamber put up signs and were heard chanting anti-fracking slogans. A large banner reading ""NO MORE SACRIFICE ZONES"" was draped over the railing while a protester was heard shouting ""Ban fracking now!"" ""I'm here to exercise my First Amendment rights in the face of a climate emergency,"" another protester told police before he was lifted from his chair and dragged him out of the upstairs area of the chamber by both arms. WARREN'S CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN: NO NEW HOMES OR BUILDINGS UNLESS THEY'RE CARBON-NEUTRAL In his address, Polis said his administration has made great progress on climate change, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions and creating of a new office to aid workers impacted by the shift of clean energy, according to Westworld. The protesters felt the governor needed to do more to shift away from fossil fuels, the outlet reported. Hours after the demonstrators were arrested, Colorado Sen. Julie Gonzales went on Facebook to share her thoughts on the issue. ""To the protesters: I appreciate your sense of urgency for climate action,"" she said. ""I hope you continue to participate in the 'inside' game of politics (attending and testifying at committee hearings, working to pass legislation, and voting, assuming you are able to do so), and in so doing abide by the rules of the game.""  A GoFundMe page was set up following the protesters' arrests to assist them with legal support and bail money. It raised about $8,000 in a period of 12 hours.",10/01/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/us/colorado-climate-change-protesters-arrested
"Climate change or poor policy? As Australia?? wildfires see some relief, blame game ascends","The sky finally cracked open atop much of the fire grounds in NSW, Australia this week  the welcome deluge slashing the number of burning fires to below 100 for the first time in more than a month. But the challenge is far from over as the finger-pointing game ignites. Much of the international attention  from Hollywood to political leaders alike  have focused on the fires as being the perils of climate change, and the nations ineffective policies in combating the globally pressing issue. Russell Crowe has avowed that the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change-based"" and Cate Blanchett stressed that when one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster, so were in it together."" Meanwhile, scores of others, from Metallica and Pink to Elton John and Chris Hemsworth, have dug deep into their pockets and donated to those endeavoring to combat the infernos. NICOLE KIDMAN REVEALS HER HOME WAS ALMOST WIPED OUT BY AUSTRALIAN WILDFIRES: 'IT'S BEEN UNDER THREAT' Yet authorities say it was a perfect storm of disturbing factors. There are many reasons for the fires starting, Paul Baxter, Commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW and President and Board Chair of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council (AFAC), told Fox News. Some have been natural  lightning  and some have been caused by human, both maliciousness and carelessness. Baxter also pointed to Australias habitat as being ripe for such a disaster. The widespread nature of bushland in Australia, the readiness of plant materials to ignite and propagate fire spread so easily and the fact that fire is a very well-known and historical factor of the Australian landscape, being a necessary factor of forest health and growth, he said. AUSTRALIA WILDFIRE AREAS MAY SEE THUNDERSTORMS, HEAVY RAIN AS SMOKE IMPACTS AUSTRALIAN OPEN NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) has stated that the largest conflagrations were enkindled by dry lightning, essentially lightning storms without rain. And some victims and analysts have bemoaned calls to address climate changes as secondary to fixing what they consider to be a broken system. Climate change has brought bountiful rains throughout most of the past two decades, which have suppressed wildfires and allowed for more vegetation growth. That is a good thing, said James Taylor, Director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center for Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute. However, Australian government policies that discourage or prohibit prescribed burns and other proactive land management have meant that when we finally have a dry year, there is more fuel for the fires, less management of the vegetation that fuels the fires, and a greater chance of wildfires burning out of control. Baxter asserted that it was clear to him that climate has an impact on the current situation. Regardless of the reasons for climate change, we all know from the facts that the climate is changing, he said. We have longer, hotter, and drier fire seasons. The winters are shorter, meaning that the hazard reduction or 'prescribed burning is much shorter, and we have less days to get the required burning done. NEWS CORP ANNOUNCES MAJOR DONATION FOR AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRE RELIEF Prescribed or hazard reduction burning refers to deliberate, monitored fires conducted during off-seasons, aimed at clearing out flammable materials from precarious terrain. It is regulated and administered by agencies at a state level, such as park authorities or environmental bodies. Eucalyptus trees, an Australian bushland staple, are also known to be especially flammable. The likes of Collen Jackson, a 46-year-old farmer in the town of Benembra, see environmentalists as problematic catalysts in obstructing hazard reduction. The traditional owners of this land have used circle burn techniques for thousands of years to control the build-up of hazardous material  leaf matter, bark, fallen dead wood, low bushy trees. These circle burns allowed animals to escape the fire and, at the same time, cleaned up the forest floor to remove fuel for a wildfire, she said. This type of burning has been refused by the government due to environmentalist pressure. From Jacksons lens, this has allowed almost 30 years of fuel buildup on the forest floor and thus has made these fires uncontrollable by increasing the heat of the fires one thousandfold. Its like any fire, the less wood you add to it, the less it burns. Lightning strikes would still have ignited a fire due to dryness, but if there was no fuel on the forest floor, then the fires would not have been so ferocious, she continued. Others lamented hefty fines for creating unauthorized firebreaks or conducting hazard reduction without going through the permit process. All considered, climate change is suppressing Australian wildfires, but poor government policies, ironically supported by climate and environmental activists, are making the present wildfires worse, Taylor conjectured. Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce claimed on national television this year that green caveats hindered his team reduction burns, in essence leading to the fire crisis. However, the Australian Greens party has subsequently come out to refute such claims, stressing in a statement that they support hazard reduction burns and back burning when guided by the best scientific, ecological and emergency service expertise. The Coalition has spent six years in office ignoring the main cause of these unprecedented bushfires  severe climate change, said the statement. The major cause of climate change that has led to these bushfires and extremely dry conditions around the country is the mining, burning and exporting of coal, oil, and gas. Australia is the worlds fourth-largest producer of coal, which remains its most valuable export. Coal is the single biggest driver of climate change, contributing to nearly half of carbon emissions worldwide. Australia is currently the worlds largest coal exporter, which is troubling, particularly as we see governments across the world phasing out coal and financial institutions also starting to back away from financing coal, said Julie Anne Miranda-Brobeck, communications manager for Global Witness, an NGO that endeavors to exposes natural resource corruption and human rights abuses worldwide. Coal is simply not economically viable. INSIDE THE SHADOWY, UNSPOKEN WORLD OF PRISON RAPE Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison has pledged to address issues around hazard reduction for national parks, dealing with land clearing laws, zoning laws and planning laws around peoples properties and where they can be built. He has also underscored that there were many contributing factors to the mammoth blazes, including the ongoing drought and fuel loads. The federal government has requested that the parliaments environment and energy committee initiate an investigation pertaining to land and vegetation management. Morrison has furthermore denied accusations that he has failed to acknowledge climate change during his tenure in office. But he also has remained steadfast in protecting the coal industry and the hundreds of thousands of families who rely on it to make ends meet. For five months, Australia has been swathed in apocalyptic scenes of seemingly eternal fires ravishing its heartland, its animals, home, and lives. So far, the blazes have killed 28 people, destroyed 2,600 homes and scorched an area of more than 25.5 million acres, roughly the size of South Korea. The cost of the damage is expected to exceed $3 billion. ROBERT IRWIN 'ABSOLUTELY HEARTBROKEN' OVER DEVASTATING AUSTRALIA WILDFIRES Arson, too, has played its part. Police in New South Wales this week announced that, since the beginning of November, two dozen people have been charged with intentionally lighting fires, while 53 others have been accused of failing to comply with total fire ban regulations. A further 47 people have had legal action taken against them for dumping a burning cigarette or match on arid land. In Queensland, law enforcement has apprehended some 101 people for igniting blazes  69 teenagers and 32 adults  and in Victoria, some 43 have reportedly been charged. Scientists insist that climate change has acerbated already ripe conditions for calamitous fires, while critics have contended that such devastation is nothing new to the Australian landscape. In 2009, the infamously-named Black Fires took the lives of 173 people, and more than 2000 homes were destroyed. In 1974, some 290 million acres of land were decimated by flames across Australias interior. The fire season of 1966 brought with it 62 lives lost at 7000 rendered homeless as over 4000 buildings burned, and dating back to the 1800s documentation from a single fire season highlights that 640,000 acres burned, 12 people died, and thousands of dwellings charred to the ground. This is not Australias hottest year. Nor is it Australias driest year.  Bushfires are a common occurrence there, going back a long time, argued Steve Milloy, publisher of JunkScience.com. The 1939 bushfires, for example, were much worse.  The most important reason for the bushfires is poor land management practices.  We know that because the Aborigines have cut their fires by 50 percent because of controlled burns, as even the New York Times has reported. GET THE FOX NEWS APP But for those most impacted by the combustion  some described shooting their animals, their faces awash with tears  skepticism remains that it will never really be over. The fires are still burning and will be for months. I am sitting right in the middle of the impact zone. I know my farm will be burned, I just dont know when, Jackson said. The government wont be here, and they told us that three weeks ago  we are on our own. Yet if they had spent a small amount and control-burned their land, which borders mine, the fire would not have fuel to rush at me so fast. Unfortunately, our government is controlled by the majority of voters in the city who know nothing of country life.",17/01/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/world/australia-wildfire-climate-change-poor-policy-blame-game

The 53-year-old actor declared that billionaires were getting nervous, while the corporate media were confused about Sanders campaign. And, it seems like every conceivable power structure on earth is trying to kill or derail our movement, but were still here, he said. He then decried a form of capitalism he dubbed predatory capitalism, which takes our lives... our labor, our spirt, our air and water, even our earth. He continued, Bernie respects us enough to tell the truth, the hard truth: We have a 10-to-12-year window to radically transform our energy systems, or climate change, predatory capitalism, and endless war economies will rob us of the right to any future at all.

"1,200-year-old Viking climate change prediction engraved in stone","A startling message on a 1,200-year-old granite slab created by the Vikings appears to predict climate change, experts say. The research, published in Futharc: International Journal of Runic Studies, looks at the message that was written after Viking warrior Varin's son died in battle in the 9th century, foreseeing a new ""climate crisis,"" similar to the weather conditions that happened nearly 300 years prior. ""This study proposes instead that the inscription deals with an anxiety triggered by a sons death and the fear of a new climate crisis similar to the catastrophic one after 536 [AD],"" researchers, led by Per Holmberg, wrote in the study's abstract. VIKINGS LEFT GREENLAND BECAUSE THEY OVER-HUNTED WALRUSES, RESEARCH CLAIMS Holmberg and his researchers decoded the message that spoke of Theodoric the Great, who reigned during the Dark Ages. The nearly 8-foot stone was written in ""nine enigmatic questions,"" according to the abstract, five of which pertain to the sun. The other four ask issues related to the Norse god, Odin. ""A central finding is that there are relevant parallels to the inscription in early Scandinavian poetry, especially in the Eddic poem Vafrunismal,"" the abstract added. Viking leaders were believed to have outsized influence on crop control, giving Varin's warning outsized importance during the time period. According to The Sun, prior to the death of his son, a solar eclipse occurred, a solar storm turned the sky red and an exceptionally cold winter happened, leading to Varin eventually hiding the warnings in the stone. 536 A.D. is widely regarded as ""the worst year to be alive,"" as the planet's population was ravaged by disease and famine and a mysterious fog that covered a significant portion of the globe for 18 months. In an interview with Science Magazine in 2018, Harvard professor Michael McCormick said he thinks the planet did not recover from the events until 640 A.D. MYSTERIOUS DOUBLE VIKING BOAT BURIAL DISCOVERED Several Viking-era discoveries have surprised archaeologists in recent years. In October 2019, archaeologists excavating a site at Vinjeroa in central Norway uncovered the boat grave of a woman who died in the second half of the 9th century. Shell-shaped gilded bronze brooches and a crucifix-shaped brooch fashioned from an Irish harness fitting were found in the grave, along with a pearl necklace, two pairs of scissors, part of a spindle and a cows skull, according to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). A grave containing the skeleton of a Viking warrior, long thought to be male, was recently confirmed as female in Sweden in February 2019. In 2018, a Viking Thors hammer was discovered in Iceland and archaeologists in Norway used ground-penetrating radar technology to reveal an extremely rare Viking longship. Also in 2018, an 8-year-old girl discovered a 1,500-year-old sword in a Swedish lake and an incredible trove of silver treasure linked to the era of a famous Viking king was discovered on an island in the Baltic Sea. Hundreds of 1,000-year-old silver coins, rings, pearls, and bracelets were found on the German island of Ruegen.

GOP looks to counter Green New Deal with three-pronged climate change plan: report,"Republicans looking to counter the Green New Deal are planning a climate change proposal of their own, taking a multi-pronged approach to improving the environment. The effort, according to Axios, is being spearheaded by House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., alongside Reps. Garret Graves, R-La., and Bruce Westerman R-Ark. McCarthy held a caucus event on climate change Thursday, and appears to be taking action that counters critics who believe the GOP is not concerned with environmental issues. AOC DOUBTS TRUMP WILL TAKE ON FOSSIL FUEL FIRMS: 'I THINK HE'S IN THEIR POCKET' ""If you look at this conference today, we just had a whole event talking about the environment, not because someone is driving us but because we care about it,"" he told Axios. The proposed policies reportedly focus on three particular efforts. The first is the capturing of carbon dioxide emissions. Part of this includes what is being called the Trillion Trees Act, whereby legislation would look to increase the number of trees in the U.S., with the goal of using them for ""sequestering"" carbon. The congressmen are also looking to expand tax credits for companies that capture and store carbon dioxide. The plan does not include emissions targets that are favored by Democrats. Graves claimed that setting ""arbitrary targets"" would be ""a mistake."" The second part of the plan is the promotion of clean energy technology by doubling investment in clean air research and lowering taxes for companies that export clean air tech. Nuclear power and natural gas are also featured in the plan.  The third area of focus is conservation, especially when it comes to plastic. This includes cleaning up pollution from plastic, urging government labs to develop improved recycling methods, and directing foreign aid to nations whose rivers suffer the most from plastic pollution. The Green New Deal, pushed by lawmakers including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., takes a more far-reaching approach, with Sanders calling for a ""wholesale transformation of our society"" in which transportation and the economy are overhauled.",21/01/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-looks-to-counter-green-new-deal-with-climate-change-proposals

Im looking for a primary, caucus [vote], Biden told Fallon, who said he's supporting Steyer in the caucuses next week. Fallon then asked for a picture, to which Biden said no. The exchange went viral online after video from journalist Zaid Jilani surfaced, and it soon brought criticism from Steyer, who said it was no way to treat an Iowan.

"Prince Harry, Leonardo DiCaprio and other celebrities who are hypocritical on climate change","The annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which wrapped up last week, gathered business leaders and political elites to discuss, among other things, the impact of climate change and what could possibly be done about it. The three-day event saw appearances from high-profile climate activists, including 17-year-old Greta Thunberg, who gave a speech in which she scolded world leaders from not doing enough to tackle the problem. After the speech, Thunberg was photographed with the U.K.s Prince Charles, a longtime climate activist who launched an initiative to encourage rapid decarbonization. Yet his travel habits appear to be at odds with his purported goal of reducing carbon emissions. According to the British tabloid the Daily Express, the 71-year-old chartered multiple private flights this month for business, yet half of them had no passengers on board. The trips reportedly covered nearly 8,000 miles and emitted 75 tons of carbon. But Charles is not the only one with ostensibly hypocritical practices on climate change. Here are four other climate activist celebrities who have not practiced what they preach: Thom Yorke Thom Yorke, the frontman behind the English rock band Radiohead, is known for his involvement in environmental causes. But his job, which involves touring by plane, seems to fly in the face of saving the planet. In an interview with BBC in September 2019, the 51-year-old musician appeared to concede as such. ""The thing I've always struggled somewhat with is that if I'm campaigning on climate change, I'm someone who has to fly for my work, so, boom, I'm a hypocrite,"" he said. ""I totally agree I'm a hypocrite, but I'm trying to do something about it, and yes, you're right, I'm a hypocrite."" Leonardo DiCaprio  Leonardo DiCaprio is a well-known champion of the environment, having founded an organization dedicated to raising awareness of climate change. But the 45-year-old actor has also repeatedly drawn criticism for his use of a private jet to attend events. Following an appearance at Global Citizen in New York in 2019, DiCaprio was widely mocked for his use of yachts and private planes. ""I would love to hear what he is saying but his enormous carbon footprint is blocking the speakers,"" wrote one Twitter user in response to a Hollywood Reporter article. Another user posted a picture of DiCaprio lounging on a yacht and wrote: ""The sacrifices he makes for his beliefs!"" Prince Harry and Meghan Markle The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been slammed for their extensive use of private jets, despite their professed commitments to fighting global climate change. The couple sparked outrage last summer after outlets reported that they had flown four private jets in just 11 days. It was later revealed that Elton John had paid for one of their flights to reserve their safety and privacy. Amid negative publicity, Harry conceded that ""no one is perfect"" but ""we all have a responsibility for our own individual impact."" ""I spend 99 percent of my life traveling the world by commercial [flights],"" the 34-year-old said during a speech in Amsterdam while promoting a new travel sustainability initiative.

"Climate change could destroy half of Earth's animal and plant species in the next 50 years, disturbing stud...","A disturbing new study suggests that climate change could wipe out half of the planets animal and plant species by 2070. The research notes that if temperatures rise 0.5 degrees Celsius around the globe, approximately half of the world's species would become locally extinct. If temperatures were to rise 2.9 degrees Celsius, 95 percent of the species would become locally extinct. ""In a way, it's a 'choose your own adventure,'"" one of the study's authors, John Wiens, said in a statement. ""If we stick to the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, we may lose fewer than two out of every 10 plant and animal species on Earth by 2070. But if humans cause larger temperature increases, we could lose more than a third or even half of all animal and plant species, based on our results."" DOOMSDAY CLOCK MOVES TO 100 SECONDS TO MIDNIGHT -- CLOSEST POINT TO NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION SINCE COLD WAR The decade that just ended was by far the hottest ever measured on Earth, capped off by the second-warmest year on record, 2019, according to data from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The decade had eight of the 10 hottest years on record. The only other years in the top 10 were 2005 and 1998. Wiens and the other researchers looked at data from 538 species in 581 different parts of the globe. The focus was on ""plant and animal species that were surveyed at the same sites over time, at least 10 years apart,"" the statement said, adding that 44 percent of the 538 species had already gone extinct at one or more of the sites. ""Surprisingly, extinctions occurred at sites with smaller changes in mean annual temperatures but larger increases in hottest yearly temperatures,"" the study's authors wrote. ""By analyzing the change in 19 climatic variables at each site, we could determine which variables drive local extinctions and how much change a population can tolerate without going extinct,"" study co-author Cristian Roman-Palacios added. ""We also estimated how quickly populations can move to try and escape rising temperatures,"" Roman-Palacios continued. ""When we put all of these pieces of information together for each species, we can come up with detailed estimates of global extinction rates for hundreds of plant and animal species."" Other studies have previously focused on the species migrating to cooler habitats to avoid the negative impact from a warming climate. However, Wiens and Roman-Palacios said that most of these species will not be able to move fast enough to avoid extinction. EARTH'S OCEANS HAVE WARMED BY RATE OF MORE THAN 3B ATOMIC BOMBS OVER PAST 70 YEARS, SHOCKING STUDY SAYS They added that species that lived in tropical regions were two to four times more likely to go extinct than those in temperate parts of the world. ""This is a big problem because the majority of plant and animal species occur in the tropics,"" Roman-Palacios said. The research was published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In early November, the Trump administration began its formal withdrawal from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, which was agreed to in 2015 under the Obama administration. As part of the agreement, nearly 200 nations, including China, would provide their own goals to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that lead to climate change.

Jeff Bezos donates $10B to fight climate change,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced on Monday that he will commit a whopping $10 billion to fight climate change as part of a new initiative. The money, which will be doled out in grants via a new fund known as the Bezos Earth Fund, is one of the largest individual donations made so far to fight the effects of climate change. The fund will start issuing the grants this summer, Bezos said in the Instagram post announcing the news. JEFF BEZOS SPLURGES, SPENDING $255M ON LA PROPERTIES The Amazon CEO, whose net worth is over $120 billion, said that ""climate change is the biggest threat"" to Earth and the money he's donating will ""fund scientists, activists, [non-government organizations]  any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world."" ""We can save Earth,"" Bezos continued. ""Its going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals. Im committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer. Earth is the one thing we all have in common  lets protect it, together."" Bezos has made other philanthropic moves in the past, including the announcement of a network of free preschools in low-income communities in 2018, according to the New York Times. In 2017, he tweeted that he was looking for philanthropy ideas to assist people in the short run.   Separately on Monday, a new study was published that said extreme weather events caused by climate change could result in an economic recession ""the likes of which we've never seen before."" Similar studies have also been published in recent months that have tied in extreme weather and climate-related events to negatively impacting the economy. A study circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research in August suggested that ""virtually all"" nations will be negatively affected by climate change by 2100 if they do not abide by the 2015 Paris Agreement. In June, the United Nations Human Rights Council published a report that warned of a potential ""climate apartheid,"" splitting the planet between the wealthy and the rest of the world who will be ""left to suffer."" A separate study published in April 2019 warned of the startling economic dangers that pollution from plastic in the oceans could cause  perhaps as much as $2.5 trillion. Skeptics have largely dismissed fears over mans impact on global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time. They also claim the dangers of a warming planet are being wildly exaggerated and question the impact that fossil fuels have had on climate change.

Climate change and pollution could eliminate nearly all coral reefs by end of century,"Coral reefs around the world are dying and scientists are looking at a variety of ways to save these endangered structures, including growing them in labs and trying to make them pollution-resistant. However, newly presented research says climate change and pollution could eliminate nearly all coral reef habitats on the planet by the end of the century. The research said that warming, acidic oceans and rising temperatures could wipe out ""nearly all existing coral reef habitats by 2100,"" adding that efforts to restore the reefs ""will likely meet serious challenges."" By 2100, its looking quite grim, said University of Hawaii Manoa biogeographer Renee Setter in a statement. Setter presented her findings at the annual San Diego-based Ocean Sciences Meeting. DYING CORAL REEFS COULD BE SAVED BY PLAYING SOUNDS OF HEALTHY CORAL REEFS FROM SPEAKERS In August, the government agency that manages Australia's Great Barrier Reef downgraded its outlook for the corals' condition from ""poor"" to ""very poor"" due to warming oceans. Florida scientists have enacted a 10-year, $100 million program in an effort to stop coral reef deaths in the Florida Keys. Setter, along with the other researchers, noted that while the efforts being made so far to clean up plastic pollution in the oceans--which could have a $2.5 trillion impact on the global economy--and cleaning the beaches are positive steps, much of the impact comes from emissions. Trying to clean up the beaches is great and trying to combat pollution is fantastic. We need to continue those efforts, Setter added. But at the end of the day, fighting climate change is really what we need to be advocating for in order to protect corals and avoid compounded stressors. LAB-GROWN CORAL COULD SAVE ENDANGERED REEFS To come up with the findings, Setter and the other researchers simulated ocean environment conditions, including sea surface temperature, wave energy and acidity of the water, among other inputs. They found that where coral reefs are located at the present, the conditions for ""suitable habitats"" would not exist by 2045, with the situation getting dire extended out to 2100. Honestly, most sites are out, Setter said. There are a few viable sites looking out to 2100, including ""small portions"" of Baja California and the Red Sea. However, these locations are not considered ""ideal,"" because of how close they are to rivers. Skeptics have largely dismissed fears over mans impact on global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time. They also claim the dangers of a warming planet are being wildly exaggerated and question the impact that fossil fuels have had on climate change.

Oregon walkout redux: State GOP leaves to prevent climate bill from advancing,"Republican Senators in Oregon walked out of the State Capitol on Monday to prevent a vote on a bill aimed at stemming climate change, a similar action taken by GOP lawmakers last year that was followed by threats of having the state police forcibly returning them. The walkout prompted Democratic Gov. Kate Brown to accuse the Republican lawmakers of being against the Democratic process. Democrats maintain a majority in both chambers of the state Legislative Assembly. If they dont like a bill, then they need to show up and change it or show up and vote no. They should make their voices heard rather than shut down state government, she said at a news conference. Large trucks supporting the GOP lawmakers drove around the state Capitol in Salem blowing their horns. The bill is intended to lower greenhouse gas emissions, a major contributor to climate change. It calls for the state to reduce emissions to at least 45 percent below 1990 emissions levels by 2035 and by least 80 percent by 2050. The bill would force big greenhouse gas emitters to obtain credits for each metric ton of carbon dioxide they emit. Opponents say fossil fuel companies will wind up offloading increased costs to customers. A proposal by Republicans to put the matter before voters in November failed Monday before it was sent to the Senate for a floor vote. Just give them the right to vote, Republican state Sen. Fred Girod said.  After the rejection, only 19 senators -- all Democrats -- remained on the floor, one shy of the minimum to proceed. Monday's walkout was a repeat of last year when state GOP lawmakers refused to participate to implement a cap-and-trade program. Senate President Peter Courtney said he wouldn't involved the authorities this time.",24/02/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oregon-walkout-redux-state-gop-leaves-to-prevent-climate-bill-from-advancing
Greta Thunberg says climate change critics are ??esperate??after using sexually graphic image of her,"Teen activist Greta Thunberg said Saturday that climate change critics are getting desperate after a cartoon depicting her being sexually assaulted was printed on bumper stickers in Canada. The image on the stickers, which circulated last week, depicts a naked woman from the back and a pair of hands pulling on her braids while engaged in an apparent sexual act. The name Greta is printed across the womans lower back. The logo for X-Site Energy Services, a Canadian oil and gas services company, is printed on the bottom. CLIMATE ACTIVIST GRETA THUNBERG GETTING HER OWN BBC DOCUMENTARY SERIES They are starting to get more and more desperate..., tweeted the 17-year-old Thunberg. This shows that were winning. X-Site General Manager Doug Sparrow told Canada's City News that he has received hundreds of complaints about the image, but claimed the company was not involved in making the sticker. Its not from X-Site or any employee; someone has done this, Sparrow said. Thats all I know. GRETA THUNBERG'S MOM DESCRIBES TEEN ACTIVIST'S STRUGGLES WITH AUTISM, EATING DISORDER IN NEW BOOK Police in Red Deer, Alberta, the town where X-Site is based, opened an investigation into the sticker, which they initially called distasteful. Investigators ultimately determined the sticker did not constitute a criminal offense since it did not meet the elements for child pornography or depict a non-consensual act that would be considered a direct threat to the person, police said in a news release. Michelle Narang, an Alberta resident, called out the sticker on social media last week. She told HuffPost Canada that a friend in the oil industry sent her the image, which had been circulating at job sites. The image has since been condemned by many on social media, including Leela Sharon Aheer, Alberta's minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women. The graphic ... is completely deplorable, unacceptable and degrading, Aheer tweeted. This is not what our province stands for. Whoever is responsible should be ashamed and apologize immediately. I stand with Albertans against this horrendous image. Thunberg, who has become a symbol for action against climate change, led a peaceful march on Friday through the southwestern British city of Bristol, where thousands of young people joined the Swedish activist.

"Half of world?? beaches will disappear by 2100 because of climate change, experts say","Almost half of the world's sandy beaches could be gone by 2100 if climate change continues as is, according to a new study published on Monday. The research, published in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change, forecasts that coastlines, which are densely populated, could see further erosion. The scientists used satellite imagery to track how beaches have changed over the past 30 years. ""A substantial proportion of the worlds sandy coastline is already eroding, a situation that could be exacerbated by climate change,"" researchers wrote in the study's abstract. ""Here, we show that ambient trends in shoreline dynamics, combined with coastal recession driven by sea level rise, could result in the near extinction of almost half of the worlds sandy beaches by the end of the century."" CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLLUTION COULD ELIMINATE NEARLY ALL CORAL REEFS BY END OF CENTURY Speaking with The Associated Press, the study's lead author, Michalis Vousdoukas, said that half of these beaches ""will experience erosion that is more than 100 meters. It's likely that they will be lost. Beaches are valuable for recreation, tourism and wildlife, while also providing a natural barrier that protects coastal communities from waves and storms. A study published in February suggested that extreme weather events caused by climate change could result in an economic recession ""the likes of which we've never seen before."" Many coastal areas, including beaches, are already heavily affected by human activity such as seashore construction and inland dams, which reduce the amount of silt flowing into oceans that's crucial for beach recovery. ""A substantial proportion of the threatened sandy shorelines are in densely populated areas, underlining the need for the design and implementation of effective adaptive measures,"" the authors wrote in the study's abstract. Some places will be affected significantly worse than others. The study's authors estimate that Gambia and Guinea-Bissau in West Africa could lose more than 60 percent of their beaches. Australia could be the worst hit in terms of total beach coastline lost, at more than 7,500 miles. The U.S., Canada, Mexico, China, Iran, Argentina and Chile are also at risk of losing thousands of miles of coastline, the study added. PLASTIC POLLUTION IN WORLDS' OCEANS COULD HAVE $2.5 TRILLION IMPACT, STUDY SAYS Multiple scenarios were taken into account by Vousdoukas and the other researchers, including one where there is a 2.4 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures and another one that rises twice that amount. A separate study published in February suggested that if global temperatures were to rise 0.5 degrees Celsius over the next 50 years, approximately half of the world's species would become locally extinct. If temperatures were to rise 2.9 degrees Celsius, 95 percent of the species would become locally extinct. The landmark Paris Climate Agreement, which was agreed to in 2015 under the Obama administration, was not taken into account, Vousdoukas told the AP, because it is considered unlikely to be achieved. In early November, the Trump administration began its formal withdrawal from the agreement. As part of the Paris Climate Agreement, which nearly 200 nations signed, including China, the long-term goal is to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Despite the dire outcome of the study, not all hope is lost. The study's authors said that even a ""moderate"" reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could prevent 40 percent of the potential shoreline retreat. Skeptics have largely dismissed fears over mans impact on global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time. They also claim the dangers of a warming planet are being wildly exaggerated and question the impact that fossil fuels have had on climate change.

Ice loss in Antarctica and Greenland increased sixfold in the last 30 years,"Antarctica and Greenland are losing ice six times faster than in the 1990s, a pair of studies in the journal Nature show. According to the international team of climatologists behind the research, the unprecedented rate of melt has already contributed 0.7 inches (1.78 centimeters) to global sea level rise in the last three decades, putting the planet on track for the worst-case climate warming scenario laid out in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) latest report. The dreaded scenario, which predicts a total sea level rise of 23.6 inches (60 cm) by the year 2100, would put hundreds of millions of people living in coastal communities at risk of losing their homes  or their lives  to flooding. ""Every centimeter of sea level rise leads to coastal flooding and coastal erosion, disrupting people's lives around the planet,"" study author Andrew Shepherd, a professor of Earth Observation at the University of Leeds in England, said in a statement. ""If Antarctica and Greenland continue to track the worst-case climate warming scenario, they will cause an extra 6.7 inches (17 cm) of sea level rise by the end of the century."" ""This would mean 400 million people are at risk of annual coastal flooding by 2100,"" Shepherd added. For the new studies, a team of 89 scientists assessed ice loss data from 11 satellites that have been monitoring Antarctica and Greenland since the early 1990s. The data created a detailed picture of how much mass each region's glaciers have lost over the last 30 years, and showed how quickly the remaining ice is flowing into the sea. The team found that Greenland and Antarctica have lost a combined 7 trillion tons of ice (6.4 trillion metric tons) from 1992 to 2017. Almost all of the lost ice in Antarctica and about half of the lost ice in Greenland is due to warming ocean waters melting the edges of glaciers, causing each region's ice sheets to flow more quickly toward the sea. The rest of Greenland's ice loss is due to warming air temperatures, which melt the ice sheets at their surfaces, the researchers said. The rate of ice loss in each ice sheet also increased substantially over that period, rising from a combined 89 billion tons (81 billion metric tons) per year in the 1990s to 523 billion tons (475 billion metric tons) per year in the 2010s. This sixfold increase in the rate of ice loss means that the melting polar ice sheets are responsible for a third of all sea level rise, the researchers said. (Thermal expansion, which causes water to take up more space as it warms, is responsible for much of the remaining sea level rise.) The accelerated ice loss puts the planet well on the way toward the IPCC's worst-case scenario.

AOC ally pans ??idiculous??Pelosi claim on climate change measure in coronavirus bill,"A Green New Deal co-author panned Speaker Nancy Pelosi for including ""tiny"" airline emissions standards in the House's coronavirus response package, arguing now is not the time for token environmental provisions when Americans' livelihoods are hanging in the balance. Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called Pelosi's idea ""ridiculous"" to include carbon emission language in legislation designed to keep Americans from losing their incomes, homes and businesses during the pandemic. ""I helped write the #GreenNewDeal and I think this is ridiculous,"" tweeted Chakrabarti, who helped author the Green New Deal while working with Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey's office. ""The tiny little emissions standard increase doesnt even do anything meaningful to stave off climate change and gives the @GOP leverage to get rid of real help for working people. Solve the problem at hand."" Chakrabarti was reacting to a TV interview where Pelosi defended the airline carbon emission language in the House bill. TRUMP ON HOUSE DEMS' CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL: 'NO WAY IM SIGNING THAT DEAL' WITH 'GREEN NEW DEAL STUFF ""There is a whole concern in our country that if we're giving tens of billions of dollars to the airlines, that we could at least have a shared value about what happens to the environment,"" Pelosi said. The House stimulus bill, which hasn't passed, includes aid to the flagging airline industry but requires the airlines to fully offset their carbon emissions starting in 2025. The House Democrats'  legislation also calls for airlines to reduce their carbon emissions by 25 percent by 2035 and 50 percent by 2050. Republicans panned the House bill as being bogged down with unrelated goodies, including climate change provisions. President Trump and Republicans ripped the legislation as an effort to try to pass the ""Green New Deal,""  while Americans are struggling to keep their homes, businesses and health. However, the Green New Deal isn't in the House legislation. The Green New Deal aims to move away from old environmental regulations, such as airline emission and carbon cap and trade deals. The blueprint of the Green New Deal is a manufacturing initiative to build up a massive new clean energy infrastructure by ramping up production of solar panels, wind farms, batteries, new power grids, electric cars, charging stations and more. Green New Deal activists took issue with the coronavirus stimulus bill being stymied by minor environmental provisions they deem as laughable. Chakrabarti encouraged lawmakers to pass simple legislation immediately  -- without environmental mandates -- that ensures Americans have money coming in. ""Imagine if Pelosi had passed a simple, 5-page bill that just did the obvious stuff everyone knows [could] hold the economy together,"" the AOC ally tweeted. ""Payroll covered, debts pause[d], direct cash to people, 0% interest loans for business. Then dare the Senate to oppose it. Wed have a bill last week."" WHITE HOUSE, SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON HISTORIC $2T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL; PELOSI OFFERS TEPID ENDORSEMENT During a conference call with House Democrats Tuesday afternoon, at least one Blue Dog Democrat said Pelosi's House bill ""set people off"" and angered struggling constituents in moderate districts who think Democrats were trying to seek partisan wins like the ""Green New Deal,"" according to a person familiar with the call. Pelosi quashed the claim and said the Green New Deal isn't part of the House bill, just the airline emissions standards. Her message to the Democrats was: I do not support the Green New Deal. There is no Green New Deal in our bill, the source said. The airline emission hubbub is likely moot at this point. The Senate reached a bipartisan deal for its $2 trillion stimulus bill that is not expected to have airline emission regulations. If the legislation passes the Senate, it will head to the House and to Trump. It would be the largest stimulus package passed in U.S. history, yet lawmakers already acknowledged at least one other round of aid is likely needed to help American families reeling from the shutdown of the economy because of the coronavirus.",25/03/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-ally-pans-ridiculous-pelosi-claim-on-climate-change-measure-in-coronavirus-bill
Heartland Institute accuses 'climate alarmists' of exploiting COVID-19 pandemic to advance agenda,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The conservative Heartland Institute released a report on Tuesday in which it criticized leading politicians, activists, and media outlets for using the coronavirus to push their environmental agenda. ""Not surprisingly coronavirus alarm has pushed most other issues and concerns out of the news  much to the dismay of climate alarmists,"" said Steve Milloy of the Heartland Institute. ""But the alarmists arent taking displacement by coronavirus lying down. In fact, many climate alarmists are trying to use coronavirus as a means of advancing their agenda. They are trying to surf it."" The report, published on ClimateRealism.com and Heartland.org, comes amid complaints that Democrats have been trying to shoehorn some of their agenda, like emissions reductions, into legislation designed to relieve the virus' economic burden. Titled ""Never Waste a Crisis,"" it focuses on tweets, which range from asserting the coronavirus had a ""silver lining"" to others in which people attribute clearing skies or water to the lack of economic activity resulting from the virus' spread. PELOSI DEFENDS CORONAVIRUS 'WISH LIST' ON CNN, SAYS CLIMATE MEASURE BRINGS 'SHARED VALUE' Prominent figures also suggested Trump treated the coronavirus like he did climate change, that the pandemic was an opportunity to pursue ""sustainable"" growth, and that the pandemic was revealing the weaknesses of the world's economy. In one example, Sky News' Ed Conway suggested that the coronavirus was ""the ultimate weapon"" against climate change. ""Dont take this the wrong way but if you were a young, hardline environmentalist looking for the ultimate weapon against climate change, you could hardly design anything better than coronavirus,"" he said in an op-ed posted by the Times. The paper argued that Conway was highlighting the virus' ""silver lining."" According to CBS Los Angeles, clearing canals and emissions reductions were part of the ""silver lining"" of the pandemic as well. Greenhouse gas emissions are in the spotlight amid the coronavirus pandemic. In early March, satellite images from NASA and the European Space Agency spotted an enormous decline in airborne pollutants, specifically nitrogen dioxide (NO2), in large areas of China. In the U.K., a recent report by solar power specialists The Eco Experts estimates that the countrys CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions are set to drop by 28.22 million tonnes over the 12-week period following the implementation of social distancing measures on March 19. NASA also tweeted on Monday that California saw decreased nitrogen dioxide concentration. HOW CORONAVIRUS IS IMPACTING POLLUTION ACROSS THE GLOBE Oxford professor Peter Frankopan wrote in the Times that the ""world's lungs are already breathing more easily thanks to the collapse of industrial production."" Frankopan's piece was titled: ""Pandemics are terrifying but they can make the world better."" The report also included statements from politicians like former President Barack Obama, who said the ""consequences"" of denying coronavirus warnings underscored the need to stop denying climate change. DOOMSDAYS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN: THINK TANK COMPILES DECADES' WORTH OF DIRE CLIMATE PREDICTIONS ""With #Coronavirus dominating the headlines, we can't forget about another major global threat: Climate change,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted in March. He included an appeal to pass the ""Restore Mother Nature Bond Act,"" which entails $3 billion in spending on environmental projects. A DJ from Cuomo's home state said he'd be OK with using the coronavirus as a ""front"" to force humans to abstain from impacting the environment. Other examples seemed more restrained. ""A friendly reminder: The coronavirus is not a good thing. We should not cheer its effects on reducing pollution,"" writer Eric Holthaus tweeted. ""The whole point of climate action is to save lives. If anything, this pandemic is proving we can (and will) rapidly eliminate fossil fuels.""

"Biden lands major green endorsement, pledges to expand climate change plan","A leading environmental advocacy group is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden for president, saying that Novembers presidential election is our last, best chance to address the climate crisis. The political wing of the League of Conservation Voters stressed on Monday as it backed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee that the nation cannot afford the cost of inaction or another four years of a Trump presidency. NEW POLL INDICATES BIDEN TOPPING TRUMP IN GENERAL ELECTION Donald Trump is the most anti-environmental president in history, period, argued Tiernan Sittenfeld, League of Conservation Voters Action Fund senior vice president. Voters are demanding action and we are confident that, as president, Biden will immediately put our country on track for a 100 percent clean energy economy with policies centered in justice and equity that restore Americas global climate leadership. The group  which works to elect pro-environmental candidates  shelled out a record $60 million to support pro-environmental candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. CLIMATE DRIVEN 'MEGADROUGHT' EMERGING IN WESTERN U.S.: STUDY Biden, in a statement, emphasized that climate change is an existential threat, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity facing our country and our world. For me, this is personal: I live in a state that's dealing firsthand with the impacts of climate change and impacts of pollution on kids and families. I'm going to fight for my grandkids, for the families rocked by super storms and environmental injustice, and the upside  those good-paying jobs that will power a green economy, the former vice president added. Climate change was one of the leading issues in the Democratic presidential primaries, particularly among younger and more progressive voters who supported Sen.

And making some news, Biden said hes working on expanding his proposal in the coming months. ""To achieve this aim, I have asked my campaign to commence a process to meaningfully engage with more voices from the climate movement  including environmental justice leaders and worker organizations, and collaborate on additional policies in areas ranging from environmental justice to new, concrete goals we can achieve within a decade, to more investments in a clean energy economy, Biden explained.

Inslee endorses Biden after climate change conversations,"One of the Democratic Partys top crusaders for environmental action is now backing former Vice President Joe Bidens White House bid. Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee's endorsement of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee came during a guest appearance on the latest episode of Bidens series of Heres the Deal podcasts. And Inslees support was announced on the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, which is celebrated each year to demonstrate support for environmental protection. BIDEN LANDS A MAJOR GREEN ENDORSEMENT Inslee  a rival for the 2020 Democratic nomination who centered his campaign in combating climate change before ending his bid in August  had tangled with Biden over climate change at a presidential primary debate in Detroit in late July. But in the podcast, he emphasized that the former vice presidents campaign offers ""a chance for survival of life as we know it. The faster we get in harness together, the likelier it is we will remove a man who has dedicated himself to deceit and rejection of science, Inslee added as he took a shot at President Trump. The governors endorsement comes as his aides are working with the Biden campaign to discuss the environmental agenda. Those conversations were first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by Fox News. Inslee told the Times that he was convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the issue of climate change will be a major driving force of a Biden administration. You're going to have a concrete plan for action within the next 10 years to develop a clean energy plan, so we just don't plan to 2050. I know that you have efforts to really do things in the next 10 years and I'm very excited about this, Inslee told Biden during the podcast. INSLEE: TRUMP 'FORMENTING DOMESTIC REBELLION' Inslees national profile has been elevated the past two months, as Washington was the first state to deal with an outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. This past weekend he grabbed the spotlight again as he argued that the president is urging insubordination and illegal activity by supporting demonstrators protesting stay-at-home orders in multiple states. To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law, I cant remember any time in my time in America where we have seen such a thing, the governor said in an appearance on ABCs This Week. And in the podcast, Inslee said to Biden, I know that you have a willingness to follow science and really help us get us out of the COVID-19 crisis. You're going to bring a reasoned approach to that, rather than just ignoring doctors. You're going to follow their advice. You're going to be honest with us, which we don't have right now in the White House.

As COVID-19 has forced people across the country to go into lockdown in order to help curtail the spread of the virus and relieve some of the pressure on Americas healthcare system, the acclaimed actor and his son penned an op-ed for NBC News in which they look at the silver lining that this unprecedented societal change is highlighting. As everyone continues to adjust to a changed world, we have been sharing a few questions, the op-ed reads. What has the scourge of COVID-19 revealed to us? Will any of these hard-won lessons help us as we turn to face the potential calamity of climate change that looms on the horizon? CORONAVIRUS PREVENTION TIPS FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS They go on to criticize President Donald Trump and his failed leadership during the onset of the pandemic, joining the chorus of celebrities who have previously bashed his initial response to the virus as slow. Some lessons have been bitter. Here in the U.S., we have seen the cost of failed leadership. As the pandemic began its global march, President Donald Trump failed to act quickly and decisively, likely increasing its toll and worsening our pain and suffering, the duo wrote. As he has done with climate change, Trump failed early on to embrace or even understand sound scientific consensus about what must be done to protect this nation and its people. The op-ed goes on to note that while they feel the federal government has failed the United States, its frontline workers, including medical staff, grocery store workers and warehouse staff, have stepped up. He also thanked the millions of Americans who have willingly sheltered in place to protect their families and communities. Thats when they turned their attention to climate change, noting the various pleasant surprises that a decrease in things like transportation are having on the environment. VISITING THE DOCTOR DURING CORONAVIRUS: SHOULD YOU RESCHEDULE YOUR APPOINTMENT? There have also been some pleasant surprises. As many of the world's transportation and industrial sectors have reduced operations, there has been a remarkable decline in global levels of carbon dioxide emissions, the article reads. Of course, the cost in life and livelihood negates any celebration. Nonetheless, there is no denying that we have gotten a very real glimpse of the potential for global environmental repair. They add: COVID-19 has shown us the power of sound science, true leadership and early action. We must honor this knowledge if we want to avoid what is coming. The father-and-son team ended their lengthy op-ed with a call to action for the American people to both demand and take action in the fight for climate change by learning from the ongoing pandemic. As COVID-19 began its lethal march across our nation, most Americans embraced scientific consensus and understood that collective grassroots action could protect us from the worst-case scenarios, they conclude. This actionable wisdom should be at the core of our fight against climate change. If we come together to do what we can, we can and will blunt the curve of climate change and create a better world for the many generations to come.  As of Friday morning, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 3,271,961 people across 185 countries and territories, resulting in over 233,704 deaths. In the U.S., all 50 states plus the District of Columbia have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, tallying over 1,070,032 illnesses and at least 63,019 deaths.",01/05/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/robert-redford-pleasant-surprises-coronavirus-pandemic-climate-change
Michael Moore says coronavirus is a warning before Earth gets 'revenge' over climate change,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. Michael Moore called the coronavirus pandemic a gentle warning from the planet before it takes its revenge on humanity over climate change. On Tuesday, Moore, 66, released a new episode of his Rumble podcast in which he discussed the planetary emergency Earth finds itself in and how the current COVID-19 situation is just a taste of what he believes is to come. I believe that we are in a planetary emergency. A planetary emergency, my friends. And Im not talking about the coronavirus, he began Tuesdays episode. Viruses are a part of nature. This is their planet, too, they are a form of life and, like another species I know well, they are killers. This current pandemic is simply mother nature giving us a gentle warning. I know youre thinking, Mike, uh, gentle? Theres over 3 million around the world infected by this virus and a quarter-million people are dead. You call that gentle? Yes, I do. I do, but I do not diminish how God awful serious this is, how tragic it is for people that have been sick who've lost loved ones. WORKING FROM HOME DURING CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK? TIPS ON HOW TO STAY PRODUCTIVE He further asked his listeners to treat the pandemic as a warning from the planet about climate change. I really want all of you to please take this moment, take this virus as Earths slap on our collective face, he explained. Treat it as if nature is trying to tell our species to back off, slow down and change your ways. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU GET OVER THE CORONAVIRUS? The filmmaker and climate activist further warned people of the dangers facing the planet in the coming years, noting that we can no longer use solar panels and windmills to solve the problem. You do understand that this planet can remove all of us in the snap of its fingers?"" he asked. ""I know what youre thinking, Thank God the planet doesnt have any fingers. But nonetheless, if you think COVID-19 has been a bummer, then trust me, you literally cant imagine just how awful earths revenge against us is going to be for trying to choke it to f---ing death. We are in a serious, multilevel planetary emergency.  The filmmaker has climate change on the mind due to the fact that he is currently promoting his next project, Planet of the Humans, a movie about the dangers of mankinds impact on the planet and the impending doomsday that he and the experts he speaks with believe is inevitable. The movie, which is available for free on YouTube, deals heavily with the mainstream environmentalist movement and how it failed to spark any real, substantive change.",06/05/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/michael-moore-coronavirus-warning-earth-revenge-climate-change
"Climate change is influencing where tropical cyclones happen most frequently, study says","Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. While the global average number of tropical cyclones has not increased in the last four decades, a new study says climate change has been influencing where exactly those deadly storms rage. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-led research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science found that between 1980 and 2018, there was an uptick in the number of storms in the North Atlantic and Central Pacific ocean basins. We show for the first time that this observed geographic pattern cannot be explained only by natural variability, Hiroyuki Murakami, the study's lead author and climate researcher at NOAAs Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, said in a news release on Wednesday. HURRICANE FORECASTS WILL SEE SOME CHANGES FOR 2020: HERE'S WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT According to NOAA, a tropical cyclone is defined as a rotating, ""organized system of clouds and thunderstorms"" that originates over tropical or subtropical waters, and has a closed low-level circulation. Depending on where the storms are, they are either hurricanes, cyclones, tropical storms, typhoons, or tropical depressions. According to the new study, the increase of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic and Central Pacific basins between 1980 and 2018 came with a corresponding decline in storms in the western Pacific and in the South Indian Ocean. A map released by NOAA shows where the changes are, with reds, oranges, yellows showing areas with the greatest increase compared to those in blue and green, where fewer storms were recorded. According to NOAA, Murakami used climate models to determine that greenhouse gases, manmade aerosols including particulate pollution, and volcanic eruptions were all influencing where tropical cyclones were hitting as part of the study. ""Greenhouse gases are warming the upper atmosphere and the ocean,"" the agency states. ""This combines to create a more stable atmosphere with less chance that convection of air currents will help spawn and build up tropical cyclones."" WHAT WAS THE WORST HURRICANE TO HIT THE US? HERE ARE THE DEADLIEST STORMS EVER A decline in particulate pollution and other aerosols that help create clouds and reflect sunlight, due to pollution control measures, may actually increase the warming of the ocean by allowing more sunlight to be absorbed by the seas, according to Murakami. WHAT WAS THE WORST HURRICANE TO HIT THE US? HERE ARE THE COSTLIEST STORMS One of the reasons for the active tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic over the last 40 years is diminishing manmade aerosols, Murakami said. In the period of the study, volcanic eruptions also were found to have temporarily altered the location where tropical cyclones were forming. CLICK HERE FOR MORE WEATHER COVERAGE FROM FOX NEWS  The major volcanic eruptions in El Chichon in Mexico in 1982 and Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 caused the atmosphere of the northern hemisphere to cool and resulted in less heat in the oceans, which shifted tropical cyclone activity southward for a few years, according to the study. Since 2000 ocean warming resumed, which the study said led to increased tropical cyclone activity in the Northern Hemisphere. What about in the future? A continued increase in greenhouse gases could lead to an overall decrease in tropical cyclones worldwide by the end of the century,  according to the new study. Tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic, for instance, are projected to decrease by 2100 due to the calming effect of greenhouse gases. The annual average of 86 tropical cyclones is projected to decrease to about 69 worldwide by the end of the 21st century. ""Declines are projected in most regions except in the Central Pacific, including Hawaii, where tropical cyclones activity is expected to increase,"" according to NOAA. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP But while there may be fewer storms, many of the cyclones that form are expected to be ""significantly more severe"" due to rising sea surface temperatures that fuel the intensity and destructiveness of such storms. We hope this research provides information to help decision-makers understand the forces driving tropical cyclone patterns and make plans accordingly to protect lives and infrastructure, Murakami said. While the NOAA Climate Prediction Center will provide its initial seasonal outlook for the Atlantic basin in May, researchers at Colorado State University are predicting an above-average hurricane season this year, citing the likely absence of El Nino as a primary factor. The 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, and will include the names: Arthur, Bertha, Cristobal, Dolly, Edouard, Fay, Gonzalo, Hanna, Isaias, Josephine, Kyle, Laura, Marco, Nana, Omar, Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy, Vicky, and Wilfred.",07/05/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/us/climate-change-tropical-cyclone-hurricane-typhoon-tropical-storm-noaa-study-weather-atlantic-pacific-indian-ocean
Iceland uses coronavirus stimulus money to fight climate change,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Last week, the Icelandic government rolled out several new environmental policies and proposals addressing climate change as part of the country's second COVID-19 economic stimulus package. The plans included new funding for projects tackling climate change and a bid to ban certain single-use products. In addition to the award of approximately $3.7 million to these projects, Icelandic Minister for the Environment Gumundur Ingi Gubrandsson also introduced a bill to ban unnecessary waste."" The government's investment will be used to increase carbon sequestration, accelerate switches to sustainable energy sources, and fund further climate research with the aim of meeting the terms of the United Nations' Paris Climate Agreement. ICELAND FOREST RANGERS ENCOURAGING CITIZENS TO HUG TREES DURING QUARANTINE Around $1.3 million will be put to work aiming to naturally store carbon dioxide long-term in order to reduce levels of greenhouse gases in the earths atmosphere, according to The Reykjavik Grapevine. A recent report in the newsletter Melting Glaciers revealed that glaciers in Iceland have been rapidly retreating for 25 years due to increasingly warming temperatures. That said, skeptics have largely dismissed fears over mans impact on global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time. They've also claimed the dangers of a warming planet are being wildly exaggerated and question the impact that fossil fuels have had on climate change. The grants in Iceland's coronavirus relief include money for land reclamation projects, land quality recovery and creating new birch forests. Last year, the first-ever study to determine how many trees the Earth could support showed that an area the size of the U.S. could be restored as forests with the potential of erasing nearly 100 years of carbon emissions. Published in Science, ""The global tree restoration potential report found that there is enough suitable land to increase the worlds forest cover by one-third without affecting existing cities or agriculture. However, the amount of suitable land area diminishes as global temperatures rise. Even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the area available for forest restoration could be reduced by one-fifth by 2050 because it would be too warm for some tropical forests. Reforestation has long been a part of the Nordic country's interest. When the Vikings first arrived in Iceland in the ninth century, the land was covered in 25 to 40 percent forest. Within a few centuries, almost all of the islands trees were slashed and burned to make room for farming. This rapid deforestation has resulted in massive soil erosion that puts the 364,000-person island at risk for desertification. The Icelandic Forest Service has since taken up the helm of bringing back the woodlands to the molten surface, and Iceland's trees are slowly sprouting once again. Icelandic Forest Service Director rostur Eysteinsson told National Geographic in a short documentary that he is optimistic in their pursuit. ""To see the forests growing to see that we're actually doing some good is a very rewarding thing. A very satisfying thing,"" he said. ""Knowing which trees to plant is actually harder than you'd think. We plant about three million seedlings per year in Iceland. Most people have simply, until now, you use what you have. Here in Iceland, it's the native birch. [You] plant them and you expect that they grow. And then, the climate changes,"" Eysteinsson continued. ""The winters have become milder. Many of the trees that we planted in the 1950s -- especially Siberian Larchs -- are literally dying after several decades of being reasonably good. [They're] sitting there dead in the landscape and it's difficult to find the money to do something else with the land. [It] becomes a problem,"" he said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP ""Our aim is to produce the seed that we need here in Iceland that it will eventually all be of genetically well-adapted material,"" he added. In 2019, forestation activity took a leap with close to four million new trees planted -- a million more than the year before. The country aims to reach carbon neutrality before the year 2040.",09/05/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/science/iceland-coronavirus-stimulus-climate-change-reforestation
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to serve on Biden campaign climate change panel,"Green New Deal proponent Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will reportedly serve on a climate change panel for former Vice President Joe Bidens campaign. She made the decision with members of the Climate Justice community - and she will be fully accountable to them and the larger advocacy community during this process, Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for Ocasio-Cortez, told Reuters Tuesday. She believes the movement will only be successful if we continue to apply pressure both inside and outside the system, Hitt added. AOC TELLS DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS TO GRADUALLY 'LAYER' AMERICANS WITH IDEAS LIKE THEY'RE IN 'SCHOOL' Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the freshman Squad, was one of Sen. Bernie Sanders most vocal surrogates before he dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden last month. She will advise Bidens team on climate policy as a Sanders representative, according to Reuters. The panel is part of an effort by Bidens campaign to win over Sanders supporters and others to the partys left still wary of his candidacy, The Washington Post reported. Biden and Sanders have agreed to work together on six joint policy committees, which includes the climate change panel, according to The Post. Weve set up joint committees together to deal with how we would deal with everything from the [coronavirus] all the way down to education, the criminal justice system, the new Green Deal, etc., Biden told KLAS-TV in Las Vegas Tuesday. We have, you know, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. She is on one of the panels. Ocasio-Cortez has not formally endorsed Biden but has said she plans to vote for him, according to the Post. Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face, according to his campaign website. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.

"Climate change will turn Antarctica's coast green, algae seen from space, study says","Experts from the University of Cambridge suggest that climate change will turn the coast of Antarctica green, resulting in blooms of algae so thick and strong they could be seen from space. The research, published in the scientific journal Nature Communications, notes that even though the algae are microscopic in size, they will be plentiful enough to create ""green snow,"" a condition that is ""likely to spread as global temperatures increase."" ""This is a significant advance in our understanding of land-based life on Antarctica, and how it might change in the coming years as the climate warms,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Matt Davey, in a statement. ""Snow algae are a key component of the continent's ability to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis."" 'POTENTIALLY FATAL COMBINATIONS' OF HEAT AND HUMIDITY ARE SHOWING UP 'DECADES' BEFORE THEY WERE EXPECTED The researchers created a map of the algae comprised of satellite data and on-the-ground observations to come up with their findings. The blooms of the ""green snow"" algae are usually found on the coastline of the continent, especially near the islands on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. They bloom when the temperature is warmer than normal, between November and February, the austral summer. They're also influenced by marine birds and mammals, whose natural fertilizer acts as an accelerant. We identified 1679 separate blooms of green algae on the snow surface, which together covered an area of 1.9 kilometers squared, equating to a carbon sink of around 479 tonnes per year,"" Davey added. Nearly two-thirds of the blooms were on the small, low-lying islands, the researchers noted, but they expect it to spread greatly as temperatures rise. DISTURBING STUDY SAYS ARCTIC OCEAN COULD HAVE ICE-FREE SUMMERS IN 30 YEARS ""As Antarctica warms, we predict the overall mass of snow algae will increase, as the spread to higher ground will significantly outweigh the loss of small island patches of algae,"" said Dr. Andrew Gray, the study's lead author.

"Hurricanes growing stronger, more intense; climate change may be a factor, federal study says","Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Hurricanes have grown stronger in almost every region of the world over the past four decades and climate change may be a factor, according to a federal study. The study, published Monday and conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), analyzed 40 years of enhanced infrared satellite imagery of tropical cyclones. Our results show that these storms have become stronger on global and regional levels, which is consistent with expectations of how hurricanes respond to a warming world, James Kossin, a NOAA researcher and lead author of the study, said in a news release. Its a good step forward and increases our confidence that global warming has made hurricanes stronger, but our results dont tell us precisely how much of the trends are caused by human activities and how much may be just natural variability. CLIMATE CHANGE IS INFLUENCING WHERE TROPICAL CYCLONES HAPPEN MOST FREQUENTLY, STUDY SAYS The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), found a significant increase in tropical cyclone intensity from 1979 to 2017. According to NOAA, a tropical cyclone is defined as a rotating, ""organized system of clouds and thunderstorms"" that originates over tropical or subtropical waters, and has a closed low-level circulation. Depending on where the storms are, they are either hurricanes, cyclones, tropical storms, typhoons, or tropical depressions. The study found that the maximum sustained winds of tropical cyclones have gotten stronger over time. Data examined by researchers pointed to the increased probability of tropical cyclones becoming major hurricanes, ones that are categories 3, 4, or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale. Storms of that magnitude have sustained winds of 111 mph or greater. The analysis of satellite images over the 40-year period found that planetary warming has increased the likelihood of a hurricane developing into a Category 3 or higher by about 8 percent a decade over the period of the study. Through modeling and our understanding of atmospheric physics, the study agrees with what we would expect to see in a warming climate like ours, Kossin said in news release. HURRICANE FORECASTS WILL SEE SOME CHANGES FOR 2020: HERE'S WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT The 2019 Atlantic hurricane season was the fourth consecutive above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, with 18 named storms. In 2019, the three major hurricanes were Dorian, Humberto and Lorenzo. Dorian and Lorenzo both had the distinction of strengthening into Category 5 hurricanes. Dorian is tied with three other hurricanes  the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane, 1988s Hurricane Gilbert, and 2005s Hurricane Wilma  as the second strongest hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin in terms of wind, with maximum speeds clocking in at 185 mph. Hurricane Michael, which devastated a swath of the Florida Panhandle in 2018, underwent a period of rapid intensification to packing winds of 157-mph as a Category 5 storm. Just 36 hours before hitting Florida's coast, Michael was making its way through the Gulf of Mexico as a 90 mph Category 1 storm. Kossin's latest study built on previous work from 2013, which identified trends in tropical cyclone intensity over a 28-year period spanning from 1982 to 2009 This time around, Kossin noted that the initial dataset was ""less conclusive and required more hurricane case studies to demonstrate statistically significant results."" WHAT WAS THE WORST HURRICANE TO HIT THE US? HERE ARE THE DEADLIEST STORMS EVER Researchers extended the study to include global hurricane data from 1979-2017, in addition to identifying differences in data caused by advances in technology over time, including better imagery from satellites. The main hurdle we have for finding trends is that the data are collected using the best technology at the time, Kossin said. Every year the data are a bit different than last year, each new satellite has new tools and captures data in different ways, so in the end we have a patchwork quilt of all the satellite data that have been woven together. CLICK HERE FOR MORE WEATHER COVERAGE FROM FOX NEWS In 2018, a separate study authored by Kossin found that hurricanes are moving more slowly across land due to changes in Earths climate, resulting in greater flood risks as storms hover over cities and other areas, often for extended periods of time.

Rep. Greg Walden: Green New Deal would cripple economy ??Republicans have better way to fight climate change,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of every American. More than 118,000 people have died in the U.S. due to the coronavirus and over 45 million Americans have filed for unemployment assistance. Communities have shut down entirely, and while officials are following public health guidelines to safely reopen, getting to a new normal will take time. Shutting down our economy also significantly impacted emissions levels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates U.S. emissions could decline by more than 14 percent this year. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ TO SERVE ON BIDEN CAMPAIGN CLIMATE CHANGE PANEL And as the pandemic ravages health and economies worldwide, the International Energy Agency reports that global energy emissions may decline this year by almost 8 percent  the largest reduction ever and twice as large as the combined total of all previous reductions since the end of World War II. Still, even with the pandemic driving major economic devastation and emissions declines, global emissions barely met the United Nations target of cutting annual emissions by 7.6 percent. And, of course, developed countries like the United States are supposed to cut an even larger share, while the world allows China to continue to increase its emissions without consequence for the next decade. Simply put, even though the arbitrary U.N. climate standards may have been temporarily met in theory, it took pushing the global economy to the brink of collapse and jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions of Americans to do so. Unprecedented pandemics require a robust response, which is why Congress has passed the largest relief package in U.S. history to provide aid to American small business owners, workers, seniors and families. For Republicans in Congress, the answer to addressing climate change and bringing our country back to prosperity is clear: American innovation. Unfortunately, some Democrats say COVID-19 is a dress rehearsal for addressing the catastrophic impacts of climate change. We agree, but it doesnt have to be this way. This financial devastation is a preview of Democrats Green New Deal that is supposed to give us a socialist, emission-free utopia. For Republicans in Congress, the answer to addressing climate change and bringing our country back to prosperity is clear: American innovation. The Democrats have made clear the direction their party is headed. Their presumptive nominee for president, former Vice President Joe Biden, recently said in his climate platform that our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected, but added that, the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. While we agree the U.S. needs to utilize clean energy, lower emissions, update infrastructure, and work with our allies for a cleaner world, we vehemently disagree that shutting down our economy is the way to do it. Its no coincidence that the same communities that have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic are the ones that have suffered most because the economic devastation it has caused. Democrats are creating a false choice between combatting climate change and having a prosperous economy. We can have both, and America can supply the innovative technologies that will reduce global emissions. With millions of Americans already losing their jobs, we must find a better way to leave our world better than we found it. For example, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies promise to reduce emissions, create jobs and provide cleaner energy. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created tax credits for deploying CCUS infrastructure. According to the Department of Energys Office of Fossil Energy, the use of these credits could create 4.3 million to 6.1 million more jobs. Just recently the Internal Revenue Service released guidance to help implement these tax credits, and now American innovators have even more incentive to utilize these technologies. Nuclear innovation also plays a role in not only reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also in our national security, energy independence and economic growth. Nuclear energy continues to be a safe, emissions-free energy source with a small footprint. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The Trump administration recently released a comprehensive nuclear energy strategy to help the United States regain its nuclear energy leadership around the world  to the benefit of clean energy and national security. Unfortunately, Democrats have failed to take meaningful action to promote this vital energy source, even though it is essential for meeting emissions goals and maintaining Americas security. We also must work to overcome the supply chain threats that have been underscored during the COVID-19 pandemic. The only way to maintain our edge in innovation and achieve our goals of a cleaner, healthier and safer world is by securing our energy and manufacturing.  The good news is there are bipartisan bills that could be passed today to implement workable climate policies that will ensure a robust and prosperous economy. As an Eagle Scout, I learned to leave a campsite better than I found it, and those words have stuck with me as a member of Congress. We have learned during these unprecedented times that the American people are resilient. We need policies that can bring relief and results  and shutting down our economy long-term cannot be one of them. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

"James Baker, George Shultz, Ted Halstead: Carbon fee needed to combat climate change","As our nation responds to the economic devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, a well-designed climate policy can strengthen Americas recovery and improve its strategic position in the world. Our bipartisan carbon-dividend solution  backed by a broad coalition of supporters  is ideally suited for this moment. It will be tough enough to reverse todays economic crisis and alleviate the misery many Americans are experiencing without adding expensive or ill-conceived climate policies. An effective policy must enhance  not hamper  a domestic economy currently being savaged by the pandemic. It should also promote the competitiveness of American firms, compel China and India to do their fair share, and position the United States to win the clean energy race. Our solution to this critical challenge is a revenue-neutral national carbon fee that cuts U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2035 and returns all the revenues raised directly to all Americans. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP LABELS TRUMP AS DIRTIEST OF ALL TIME Long preferred by economists and business leaders, a well-designed and gradually rising carbon fee is the most cost-effective climate solution. But rather than allow Congress to spend revenues from such a fee on projects that it chooses, the money would be returned to American families in the form of a quarterly dividend. A carbon fee that neither grows the government nor drains the economy is not a tax in the truest form. Our carbon dividend proposal would benefit those most devastated by the growing economic recession. To cushion the initial economic blow of the pandemic, Republicans and Democrats quickly agreed to send direct cash payments to low- and middle-income families. But such payments can be financed by debt for only so long.  Our plan would keep direct payments to all American families flowing for the long term, and in a manner that is fully funded. Most families, and especially the most vulnerable, would benefit financially under this climate solution. To further stimulate the economy, our plan calls for lessening the current regulatory regime that will stunt the ability of American industry to respond to the current crisis. An escalating carbon fee that reduces emissions at the required scale and speed enables us to safely and responsibly replace regulations that would no longer be necessary. Such a COVID-era climate policy will thus provide the predictability companies need to make the kind of long-term investments that will be a critical aspect of an economic rebound. Unshackled by these regulations, American ingenuity will return our country to its prior position as the worlds leading energy innovator. The United States now ranks a distant fourth behind China, Germany and Japan in the production, export and installation of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. Just as dominance in the information technology revolution underpinned Americas economic dynamism and job growth over the past two decades, dominating the clean tech revolution will be similarly consequential in the future. Falling behind in the clean energy race imperils not only our economic strength but also our broader national interest. No less important, our climate policy promotes the competitiveness of U.S. firms and the re-shoring of manufacturing jobs.  Although American industries produce less carbon per unit than many of their competitors in other countries, current U.S. policy fails to leverage this advantage. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Effectively, we subsidize less carbon-efficient manufacturing in China and elsewhere, and invite carbon dumping by nations with more lax environmental standards. In a world of lower oil prices, reversing this situation will become even more important in protecting and enhancing the competitiveness of our companies. The best way to level the playing field and monetize Americas carbon advantage is to impose carbon tariffs on imports from countries without a similar climate program, all as part of a comprehensive U.S. climate strategy. Such a policy could help the United States reclaim its historic position at the head of the global table, thereby advancing our economic and geopolitical interests at the same time. Convincing other leading emitters such as China and India to effectively reduce their carbon emissions is a difficult chore. The proposed tariffs, however, would compel China and India to either follow suit or face economic penalties.  In addition to hastening economic recovery, our plan provides a commonsense way forward that addresses Americas toughest challenge  the political dysfunction ripping our country apart. Sadly, during this time of national calamity  when domestic cohesion is critically important  the partisan gap seems to be growing even wider. The plan we propose is not a political panacea. But it is the only approach supported by Democrats, Republicans, environmentalists and industrialists who rarely agree on anything today. It is the perfect pro-growth COVID-era climate solution.

House Dems turn to 'environmental justice' with massive climate change blueprint,"House Democrats on Tuesday released a 547-page blueprint on how to combat climate change, in which they called for environmental justice to be put at the heart of environmental and climate change policy in the coming years. Environmental justice must be at the center of federal climate and environmental policy, the massive outline, presented by the Democrats on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, says. AL GORE, UN SECRETARY GENERAL, OTHERS NOW DEMANDING 'GREAT RESET' OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM  In a glossary of the multitude of terms used in the sprawling document, Democrats define environmental justice as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, culture, national origin or income, with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies to ensure that each person enjoys (1) the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards; and (2) equal access to any federal agency action on environmental justice issues in order to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn, work, and recreate. The plan marks an attempt to outline the partys strategy on climate change and distinguish it somewhat from the Green New Deal (GND) -- an expansive far-left, multitrillion-dollar proposal championed by Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The plan is somewhat less ambitious than the GND, calling for a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, while the Green New Deal calls for the elimination of emissions by 2030. Similarly to the Green New Deal, it calls for regulations on everything from infrastructure to updated building codes to increase energy efficiency. The new plan would also mandate that no new car emit greenhouse gases from 2035 on, with heavy trucks to follow in 2040. Democrats say it would save more than 60,000 lives and $8 trillion because of benefits related to both health and climate. ""Democrats know the climate crisis is the essential crisis of our time, threatening public health, jobs and the economy, national security and values,'' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said at a press conference. Calls for radical action to combat climate change dominated the Democratic agenda in 2019, but have been swept to the aside amid the coronavirus crisis and recent national debates about race and police brutality in the wake of the death of George Floyd. There is a nod to Floyd in the document, which mentions him on the first page. There are also regular references to the question of race and how it intersects with the issue of climate. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP LABELS TRUMP AS 'DIRTIEST OF ALL TIME'  The document speaks a number of times as well about environmental justice communities which it defines as a community with significant representation of communities of color, low-income communities, or tribal and Indigenous communities, that experiences or is at risk of experiencing higher or more adverse human health or environmental effects. The many aspects of the plan would likely pass in the Democratic-controlled House but would largely be dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate. But its a plan that is setting out what the Democratic agenda would look like should Democrats win the Senate and the White House in November. Republicans dismissed it as a version of the Green New Deal, with the White House accusing Democrats of pushing radical Green New Deal-like policies that would cripple Americas economy and crush the poorest communities across the globe. Republicans on the panel had expressed anger that they had been excluded as Democrats released a partisan report. If I had known then what I know now, why did we go through this whole waste of money by putting a committee together, wasting money on staff, and do a dog and pony show with hearings? Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., told The Washington Examiner. You dont need us to do this. You certainly didn't need to spend taxpayer funds to do it. Conservative groups also strongly opposed the blueprint. Myron Ebell, the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, called it a ""ridiculously wasteful plan."" House Democrats claim there is a climate crisis that demands immediate action, yet their Select Committee on the Climate Crisis has dilly-dallied for over a year to produce a list of shopworn proposals that would benefit special interests at the expense of consumers and taxpayers,"" he said. The plan is similar to that proposed by presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. His campaign praised the plan, which also has the backing of a number of environmental activist groups. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP But the radical Sunrise Movement, which has long championed the Green New Deal, said it didnt go far enough. ""This plan is more ambitious than anything we have seen from Democratic leadership so far, but it still needs to go further to match the full scale of the crisis,'' said Lauren Maunus, the group's legislative manager.

"Dalai Lama marks 85th birthday with new album, message on climate change, coronavirus pandemic","The Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, celebrated his 85th birthday Monday with the release of an album of mantras and teachings. ""Inner World"" begins with the track ""One Of My Favourite Prayers"" and has the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, reciting meditations and sayings with accompanying music. The project came about after one of his students contacted him in 2015 with the idea, Reuters reports. CHINA INTERFERENCE IN SUCCESSION OF NEXT DALAI LAMA SLAMMED BY SEN. RISCH On Tuesday, His Holiness thanked followers and friends around the world who joined him remotely in celebrating his birthday. ""I am touched by your affection,"" he said in a letter. ""I am in good health and look forward to live long to continue being of some service to humanity."" He reflected on the ""oneness of humanity"" today amid the coronavirus and other issues. OUTRAGE AFTER CALIFORNIA BANS SINGING IN CHURCHES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC ""Climate change and the current pandemic, which threaten us all, are challenges that teach us that we must work together, making a concerted effort to reach our common goal of a more caring and more peaceful world,"" the Dalai Lama concluded. The celebration of another year comes as Buddhists around the world worry about China trying to interfere with the succession of the next Dalai Lama. The Chinese foreign ministry declared in 2011 that only the government in Beijing can appoint the next Dalai Lama and no other succession candidate would be given any recognition.  But at the end of last year, senior Buddhist priests, representing all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, unanimously endorsed the Dalai Lama's sole authority to choose his successor at a conference. It is a question of credibility, legitimacy, Lobsang Sangay, president of the Tibetan government-in-exile said at the time. China could appoint one, but the appointee will have zero credibility.

Biden's Dem platform recommendations signal concessions to Sanders-AOC wing on climate change,"A task force set up by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- who was Bidens last remaining rival in the nomination battle -- on Wednesday released a wide-ranging set of recommendations for the partys convention platform. And while the proposals lay out a progressive road map for the former vice president, the document falls short of the ambitious plans pushed by Sanders and other candidates during the Democratic primaries. AOC NAMED CO-CHAIR AS BIDEN AND SANDERS SET UP UNITY TASK FORCE The health care task force spotlights ways to expand coverage by strengthening the Affordable Care Act, which was Bidens position during the primaries, rather than pushing for a single-payer ""Medicare-for-all"" health care system, a signature policy goal for Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts that was notably absent from the document. But the climate change task force -- co-chaired by progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and former Secretary of State John Kerry -- calls for a faster timetable to achieve net-zero carbon emissions than Biden has previously advocated for, instead of the Ocasio-Cortez-championed Green New Deal to overhaul environmental policy, which also was not included in the recommendations. The freshman congresswoman and member of the so-called ""Squad"" tweeted: ""I do believe that the Climate Task Force effort meaningfully &amp; substantively improved Biden's positions."" The panel was appointed by Biden and Sanders after the populist senator from Vermont dropped out of the race and endorsed the former vice president. Its mission -- following a primary season where the sharp policy differences between the more moderate Biden and the populist Sanders and Warren were on display -- was to find common ground in six key areas: climate change, criminal justice reform, the economy, education, health care and immigration. I commend the Task Forces for their service and helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country. And I am deeply grateful to Senator Sanders for working together to unite our party, and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come, Biden said in a statement. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Sanders, in a separate statement, acknowledged that the end result is not what I or my supporters would have written alone. But the senator added that the task forces have created a good policy blueprint that will move this country in a much-needed progressive direction and substantially improve the lives of working families throughout our country."" On criminal justice reform -- which has been in the spotlight the past two months in the wake of national racial unrest following the death of George Floyd -- the proposals included a series of police reforms such as banning chokeholds, ending racial profiling and letting abuse victims pursue civil litigation. The Democrats pledged to overhaul a police system they said has ""overpoliced and underserved Black and Brown communities.""  The platform also commits the Democratic Party to support a bill that would create a commission on reparations for slavery and discrimination. As expected, the Republican National Committee took aim, accusing the task force of copying from Bernies 2020 campaign proposals. The fact Joe Biden has embraced Bernie Sanders radical agenda verbatim is proof that while Bernie may not be the one leading the Democrat Party, Biden is more than happy to be his champion in its lurch to the left, Republican National Committee rapid response director Steve Guest charged. The list of recommendations will go to the Democratic National Conventions (DNC's) platform committee to consider.",08/07/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-dem-platform-recommendations-aoc-sanders-climate-change
Gutfeld knocks Biden over climate change plan: 'Apocalyptic nine-year?vision' is 'not based on any?science',"""The Five"" co-host Greg Gutfeld argued Tuesday that Joe Biden's strategy to combat climate change is not based on established science but rather left-wing ""hysteria"" conjured by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. ""Biden, economically, is kind of terrifying because he's all in on the Green New Deal, including this apocalyptic nine-year vision that is not based on any science but rather AOC-led hysteria,"" The ""Greg Gutfeld Show"" host said. During his remarks in Wilmington, Biden accused President Trump of considering climate change a ""hoax,"" while claiming that ""science tells us we have nine years before the damage is irreversible."" ""We are going to make historic investments, so we will seize the opportunity to meet this moment in history,"" the former vice president said. ""We are going to get to work delivering results right away on day number one."" Later in the segment, Gutfeld mused that while Democrats have long claimed to be protecting America's social ""safety net,"" Republicans and President Trump are now the true holders of that mantle. ""I want people to just think about what the experience of 2020 was,"" he said. ""When we had a Republican-built, Trump-designed economy that was essentially a safety net that was tested, it was actually tested [by the pandemic], and it actually succeeded.  ""Unlike the safety nets created by Democrats, this safety net was tested by a novel catastrophe that we had never experienced in our lives. Nobody has starved, we have made it through ... We are getting it done largely because of this incredible economy that allowed a safety net to occur that gave out these payments to make sure people were OK. This was a Republican-built safety net that blew the doors off of any Democrat safety net of the last 50 years."" On the other hand, Gutfeld went on, Biden and the Democrats have posited an ""apocalyptic vision"" that ""chooses the 'mob' over the individual."" ""Biden is pushing the politics of envy,"" he said, ""and that will get us nowhere in the long run, or even the short term.""",14/07/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/media/greg-gutfeld-biden-climate-change-apocalyptic-vision
Andy Puzder: Biden's climate change policy would cause more economic harm than coronavirus,"If you think the economic shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic was bad, be forewarned: the economic impact of former Vice President Joe Bidens new climate change plan would make the last few months look like prosperity. Bidens original climate change plan was to spend $1.7 trillion over a decade and phase out fossil fuels by 2050. But that plan was unveiled during the primary season, and since then the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has moved further left. Apparently, Bidens earlier plan wasnt extreme enough to please the far-left activists who surround him, so he went back to the drawing board and came up with something even more drastic. DANIEL TURNER: BIDENS HARMFUL RADICAL ENERGY PLAN PANDERS TO AOC AND OTHER FAR-LEFT EXTREMISTS FOR VOTE Released Tuesday, Bidens new plan comes with a whopping $2 trillion price tag in the first four years and moves the deadline for switching to 100 percent carbon-free power up by 15 years to 2035. That switch would entail massive investments in new facilities and painful dislocations and job losses for millions of workers currently employed in every stage of the energy production process, from extracting resources to delivering electricity to consumers. These are just some of the complications with vastly overhauling an industry that Americans depend upon so heavily and that accounts for over $400 billion in annual economic activity. A recent analysis by Wood Mackenzie, a global consultancy group, found that the transition to a 100 percent renewable U.S. power grid would require an investment of up to US$4.5 trillion over the next 10 to 20 years. Given the cost overruns with most government projects, does anyone really believe even $4.5 trillion would be sufficient? Where is that money coming from? At least in theory, from us  through the tax increases Biden would impose upon American workers and businesses if he is elected president. The problem is, there will be far fewer workers and businesses left to pay Bidens higher tax rates once his job- and business-killing climate agenda begins to take effect. Republicans have attacked Biden for wanting to achieve this goal by totally banning fracking  the oil and natural gas extraction process that created the current American energy boom. Such a ban would kill jobs and damage the economies of key election states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. Biden has denied this, stating that he would not ban all fracking, but only wants to end new permits for federal lands and waters. But how can you achieve 100 percent carbon-free energy without eliminating oil and natural gas as an energy source  and, therefore, eliminating fracking? The reality is that you cant. Maybe Bidens position is actually that he wont ban fracking immediately, but will just eliminate it over time. But is that what voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania are hoping to hear? Should Biden be elected president, I suspect his no fracking ban pledge would soon fall into the dust bin of other infamous campaign claims  such as George H.W. Bushs 1988 pledge of no new taxes and Barack Obamas 2008 commitment that he was not in favor of gay marriage."" So, why the subterfuge? Well, this de facto fracking ban allows Biden to tell voters he will not ban fracking (with fact-checker support) while simultaneously letting his far-left supporters know that he plans to eliminate it. For Biden, this is a win-win that is certain to thrill radical climate activists  particularly the Biden campaigns climate policy adviser, Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But it also completely ignores the role fracking plays in the broader economy and in reducing  yes, reducing  carbon dioxide emissions. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, reports that carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. declined 14 percent between 2005 and 2017, mainly because more electricity has been generated from natural gas  a more efficient and less carbon-intensive fuel than either coal or petroleum. The Energy Information Administration also reports that natural gas was the largest source about 38%  of U.S. electricity generation in 2019. That inexpensive and plentiful low-carbon natural gas comes from fracking. Meanwhile, Bidens climate activist allies continue to throw up obstacles to the construction of desperately needed pipelines to deliver oil and natural gas. Pipelines are significantly safer, cleaner and more efficient than transporting oil and natural gas by truck or train. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER But climate activists view the battle over carbon dioxide emissions in quasi-religious terms. This allows them to justify actions that are rationally inconsistent with their objectives and bound to hurt low-income Americans the most, in the form of higher electricity and home-heating costs. Bidens eagerness to accommodate the demands of the far-left makes it all but inevitable that he would shelve all new and ongoing pipeline projects permanently if he ever makes it to the Oval Office. Should even Bidens current concessions prove insufficient for his climate team (as concessions to the far left so often are), expect to see the hapless nominee unveil even more extreme amendments to his new climate plan before the November election.  Dont be surprised by the changes. The zeal of those around Biden to destroy the American economy knows no bounds. Recall that Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortezs former chief of staff, admitted a year ago that the true motivation behind the Green New Deal wasnt a climate thing.  Rather, it was a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing. Thats a good thing to keep in mind come November.

Bill Gates claims pandemic's 'misery' will 'happen regularly' if climate change is not stopped,"Billionaire Bill Gates wants the United States to treat climate change with the ""same sense of urgency"" with which it has responded to COVID-19, arguing that the impacts of the former will be much worse without corrective action. ""If you want to understand the kind of damage that climate change will inflict, look at COVID-19 and spread the pain out over a much longer period of time,"" the Microsoft co-founder wrote on his blog Tuesday. ""The loss of life and economic misery caused by this pandemic are on par with what will happen regularly if we do not eliminate the worlds carbon emissions."" Gates estimated that the death toll from climate change would match that of the pandemic by 2060, and exceed it fivefold by 2100. The economic impact of climate change over the next two decades, he added, could be ""as bad as having a COVID-sized pandemic every ten years."" BILL GATES SAYS CORONAVIRUS VACCINE COULD REQUIRE MULTIPLE DOSES Early in the pandemic, some drew comparisons between the virus and climate change, and credited economic shutdowns with reducing carbon emissions. Gates acknowledged this effect, but said such temporary restrictions aren't nearly enough to address rising emissions. Whats remarkable is not how much emissions will go down because of the pandemic, but how little,"" he said, pointing to a July report estimating the cost of emissions reductions. ""Has closing off major parts of the economy avoided emissions at anything close to $100 per ton?"" Gates asked. ""No. In the United States, according to data from the Rhodium Group, it comes to between $3,200 and $5,400 per ton. In the European Union, its roughly the same amount. In other words, the shutdown is reducing emissions at a cost between 32 and 54 times the $100 per ton that economists consider a reasonable price."" At the end of his blog post, Gates called for drastic change and noted that flying or driving less wasn't going to cut it. ""So just as we need new tests, treatments, and vaccines for the novel coronavirus, we need new tools for fighting climate change: zero-carbon ways to produce electricity, make things, grow food, keep our buildings cool and warm, and move people and goods around the world,"" he said. BILL GATES PARTLY BLAMES FACEBOOK, TWITTER FOR CORONAVIRUS SPREAD ""And we need new seeds and other innovations to help the worlds poorest people  many of whom are smallholder farmers  adapt to a less predictable climate."" Meanwhile, a Duke University professor told lawmakers Wednesday that the U.S. could prevent 4.5 million premature deaths if it worked towards to keep temperature increases below two degrees Celsius. Conservatives have generally argued that climate fears are overblown, citing apocalyptic predictions from prior decades. The cost of implementing large-scale reform, they claim, would be unsustainable and inflict massive losses on the U.S. economy. The Green New Deal (GND), which Gates did not mention, has become the latest touchstone of the environmental movement in the U.S., and been championed by leading Democrats.  The right-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute, which is funded by companies in the energy, automotive and technology sectors, recently found that even a portion of the GND's mandates would cost swing-state households around $75,000 per year.",05/08/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-gates-coronavirus-pandemic-climate-change
Climate study says extended global COVID-19 shutdowns will have 'negligible' impact on temperatures,"A new study claims the coronavirus-related lockdown measures will yield emissions reductions but will have ""negligible"" overall impact on global temperatures if measures continue till the end of 2021 -- raising questions about sweeping environmental regulations with potentially massive economic tradeoffs. The study, published last week in the journal Nature Climate Change, follows presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's vow to rejoin the ambitious Paris Climate Agreement. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, has also pledged support for the Green New Deal, which calls for a series of radical and costy transformations to the U.S. economy. As the pandemic spread in the U.S., media outlets have suggested that the upside of halting economic activity was a lower burden on the environment. In May, The Washington Post claimed ""global emissions plunged an unprecedented 17 percent during the coronavirus pandemic."" While last week's study acknowledged emissions reductions, it also concluded: ""We estimate that the direct effect of the pandemic-driven response will be negligible, with a cooling of around 0.01  0.005 C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies."" This scenario assumes partial lockdown measures continue till the end of 2021 with emissions recovering to a baseline by the end of 2022. It adds that ""with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3 C by 2050."" But according to Myron Ebell, who leads the Center for Energy and Environment at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), even those changes would be futile. EPA ANNOUNCES NEW RULES TO REDUCE METHANE REGULATION, ASSURES SCIENCE WILL BACK CHANGES Since the first global warming treaty was signed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent subsidizing renewable energy,"" Ebell told Fox News on Thursday. ""Yet the only thing that has bent the curve of rising global greenhouse gas emissions has been the current economic collapse. But the drop in emissions caused by the shutdown is just a first step. To achieve the emissions targets agreed to in the Paris climate treaty in 2015 would require similar hits to the global economy every year for the next thirty years. Like the Nature Climate Change study, Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates recently pointed out that despite hemorrhaging huge sums of money, the economic shutdown left the world still needing comprehensive change. Whats remarkable is not how much emissions will go down because of the pandemic, but how little,"" he said. He pushed for quick action, noting that ""[i]t will take decades to develop and deploy all the clean-energy inventions we need."" Under former President Barack Obama, the international community rallied around the Paris Climate Agreement, which aimed to reduce global temperature increases by 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The study's authors argue that goal would still be in reach if the world pursued a ""green stimulus recovery"" from the pandemic. Still, it's unclear if the world can undergo the amount of structural transformation to adequately reduce emissions. In November, the United Nations released a report claiming that the international community had already fallen behind the goals it undertook just a few years prior. It called on the world to increase its efforts ""five-fold"" even as the U.S. -- one of the world's largest emitters -- pulled out of the agreement due to economic concerns. BILL GATES CLAIMS PANDEMIC'S 'MISERY' WILL 'HAPPEN REGULARLY' IF CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT STOPPED The World Resources Institute posits that in order to reach the Paris temperature goal, the world would need to reduce global emissions to zero by 2050 -- something U.S. lawmakers have reached for with their own proposals. For example, the Green New Deal seeks to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Liberals have defended such sweeping proposals as economically beneficial. For example, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has estimated savings as high as $70.4 trillion over 80 years by ""averting climate catastrophe."" But conservative studies indicate the burden of comprehensive transformation is simply too great. The Heritage Foundation attempted to use the Energy Information Administration's National (EIA) Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching net-zero. Not only did the model crash, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the plan. The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58 percent reduction in emissions, achieved through a $300 carbon tax  -- taxes above $300 crashed the EIA's model. Other studies from Ebell's group have attempted to measure the cost for just part of the massive climate proposal, and found swing state households could face around $75,000 within the first year or implementation. Democrats argue their plans would spur economic growth, provide jobs, and assist low-income Americans. GRETA THUNBERG AWARDED $1.15M GULBEKIAN PRIZE FOR HUMANITY, WILL DONATE TO CLIMATE GROUPS For example, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., released a ""Green New Deal for Public Housing."" ""The legislation is expected to create nearly 250,000 good-paying, union jobs per year across the country while reducing carbon emissions on the scale of taking 1.2 million cars off the road over the next ten years,"" a press release claimed. It added: ""Public housing costs would also be reduced by $97 million per year, or 30 percent, and energy costs would be slashed by $613 million, or 70 percent."" As Ebell noted, emissions have been increasing without any major disruptions since the 90s. Back in April, Anthony Watts of the conservative Heartland Institute released an analysis claiming that despite lower emissions, the world's atmospheric levels of CO2 remained the same. Both the Heartland Institue and CEI have been criticized for their ties to the Charles Koch who, with his late brother David, led a company that manufactured petroleum products. Heartland maintains that it never received funding from Koch Industries and that Charles' charitable foundation funded a project on free-market health care solutions, but not climate change.  The United Nations 2019 emissions gap report, which examines shortfalls in reaching its climate goals, expressed optimism in some countries commitments to reduce emissions. It argued that countries could surpass the 1.5 degree Celsius goal if they met their current conditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) -- or commitments they pledged to fulfill under certain conditions surrounding capability and resources. Overall, though, the report said that emissions continued to rise in spite of political attempts to address the issue. It argued that with current baseline or unconditional NDCs, theres a 66 percent chance that warming will be limited to 3.2C by the end of the century.",14/08/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/media/coronavirus-shutdowns-negligible-effect-global-warming-study
"Cooking in quarantine reduces food waste, could help climate change","While large farms and similar food industries have had to trash crops and dairy throughout the pandemic after millions adhered to shelter-in-place orders, many American households have taken an opposite approach to minimize their food waste. CORONAVIRUS FORCES FARMERS TO DESTROY THEIR CROPS A month after the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic, Americans reported they were cooking more often and wasting less food, according to a survey from HUNTER, an integrated marketing and public relations firm. Fifty-four percent engaged in more frequent cooking while 46% engaged in more frequent baking. STUCK AT HOME AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK? THIS PROFESSIONAL CHEF IS HERE TO HELP And Americans are still making meals at home four months after the surveys findings came to light, according to a new report from Reuters. We are using virtually all of our leftovers, where we used to waste food because we would forget to pack it and just pick up fast food on a lunch break, Auburn Hills, Mich. resident Clint Parry told the news outlet. While Parrys decision to use the food available in his home stemmed largely from wanting to save money, Reuters suggests the move could have a positive impact on climate change if it is adopted by the masses.  Before the pandemic, American food waste amounted to about 30% to 40%, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This estimate, based on estimates from USDAs Economic Research Service of 31% food loss at the retail and consumer levels, corresponded to approximately 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food in 2010, the government agency said on its website under a Waste FAQs page.

"Beer could taste different because of climate change, scientist says","For years, an increasing number of scientists have warned about the side effects of climate change like rising oceans and unpredictable changes in weather patterns. But this may be the most serious repercussion of climate change identified to date: Beer may taste different. That's according to the research of Colleen Doherty, an associate professor of molecular and structural biochemistry at N.C. State University. RESEARCHERS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED HANGOVER CURE: STUDY Doherty studies the connections between time and stress in plants, according to the university. In a recent post on the university's website, she explained how changing temperatures will affect hops and other beer ingredients. Growers have cultivated different varieties of hops that produce different chemical compounds in order to provide distinctive flavors in beers. However, factors like climate, soil and weather can affect how plants used in beer taste by altering their internal chemistry, according to Doherty. She compared it to the concept of terroir in wine-making, which can affect grapes and then affect the wine made from those grapes.  One of the most concerning climate change factors is that nights are getting warmer faster than days, Doherty wrote. Research has shown that subtle changes in daytime temperature are amplified at night. That can throw off a plants timing for processes like when it produces chemicals that help it combat bugs, bacteria and other threats. Warmer temperatures at night can also allow those pests to be active for longer, giving them more time to target plants. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER In other words, warmer nights mean that the temperature difference between night and day is shrinking, Doherty wrote. And that can cause an effect in plants similar to jet-lag  they find it harder to set their circadian clock. In consequence, their clock may be less sensitive to changing conditions and can become out of sync with the environment.

New Mexico governor says US faces 2 existential crises: Trump and climate change,"New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appeared in a virtual video Wednesday, the third night of Democratic National Convention, to address how climate change is a priority for presidential candidate Joe Biden. We know time is running out to save our planet, Grisham said. We have the chance this November to end two existential crises, the Trump presidency and the environmental annihilation he represents. Grisham, who was considered a potential running mate to Biden, joined a group of prominent Democratic figures Wednesday night speaking at the convention leading up to Bidens acceptance speech Thursday. DNC SPEAKERS: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM We have the chance this November to attack the climate crisis, invest in green, 21st century jobs and embrace the clean energy revolution our country, our young people are crying out for and the leadership, the rest of the world is waiting, Grisham said. Climate donors have already supplied a reported $15 million from voters who specifically identify with Biden's climate change policies, according to a report by The New York Times this week. Though $15 million only represents about five percent of his campaign donations, climate donors are expected to ramp up their donations during the convention and during the remainder of the presidential race  though some worry it wont be enough to stand up to billion dollar industries like oil. DEMS FACE ENVIRONMENTALIST BACKLASH AFTER DROPPING FOSSIL FUEL DEMAND FROM PLATFORM Democrats deplore Trumps stance on climate change, largely because he has consistently denied its existence, referring to it as a hoax on several occasions. But some democratic voters have voiced their frustration with Biden, who has not openly backed the Green New Deal, put forward by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Environmentalists were also reportedly frustrated after Bidens campaign quietly dropped language regarding fossil fuel subsidies from their platform. ""Vice President Biden's commitment to ending fossil fuel subsidies remains as steadfast as it was when he outlined this position in the bold climate plan he laid out last year, Stef Feldman, Biden's campaign policy director, said on Wednesday. Biden will reportedly seek a worldwide ban on fossil fuel subsidies and an end of U.S. fossil fuel industry subsidies. Biden announced a $2 trillion climate change policy initiative in July that would aim to revive the coronavirus-stricken economy by investing over a four-year period in infrastructure and renewable energy. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP These are the most critical investments we can make for the long-term health and vitality of both the American economy and the physical health and safety of the American people, Biden said in a Delaware speech last month.

"Newsom in DNC speech: 'If you are in denial about climate change, come to California'","California Gov. Gavin Newsom opened the final night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention with a dire warning: ""If you are in denial about climate change, come to California. Newsom, who spoke from a prerecorded message taken on a cellphone as his state battles more than 370 wildfires amid a crippling heatwave and a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic, used his two minutes to argue that action must taken to slow the speed of global climate change. The hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier, Newsom said while standing among a grove of trees. ""If you are in denial about climate change, come to California. Newsom continued: This is an extraordinary moment in our history. Mother nature has now joined this conversation around climate change. A VIEWERS GUIDE TO THE FINAL NIGHT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION An incredulous Newsom slammed President Trump for threatening to defund wildfire suppression efforts because we havent raked enough leaves. You cant make that up, Newsom said. Nor can you make up the fact that were involved in over 90 lawsuits with the Trump administration on clean air, on clean water, on endangered species, on pesticides. Newsom and Trump have had a testy relationship ever since the Democratic governor took office in 2019  with the state acting as a foil to many of the Trump administration deregulation efforts. While the tensions between the two began to thaw during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, both Trump and Newsom have recently renewed their attacks on each other as the outbreak of the deadly virus looks far from being contained. I see again, the forest fires are starting. Theyre starting again in California, Trump said Thursday at a campaign event in Old Forge, Pa. And I said, youve got to clean your floors. Youve got to clean your forests. They have massive fires again in California, he added. Maybe were just going to have to make them pay for it, because they dont listen to us. We say you got to get rid of the leaves, you got to get rid of the debris, you got to get rid of the fallen trees.  Trumps comments echoed those he made after the Camp Fire in November 2018 that destroyed much of the rural Butte County town of Paradise and killed 84 people. Despite Trumps blame on California, the federal government oversees more than half the forestland in California, while state and local agencies control just around three percent. In his brief address, Newsom added: There is so much at stake in this election, none more important than the work Joe Biden did with Barack Obama on the vehicle emissions standards. Newsom said he had to quickly jump out of the car on the way to a fire relief center to express my deep reverence, my admiration to Joe Biden, to Kamala Harris...to their commitment, not just to the environment, but to the commonwealth, to our kids, our kids kids, to our grandkids, to our legacy.",20/08/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-dnc-speech-climate-change
Pelosi says enacting climate change legislation is 'absolutely a priority' if Biden wins,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Thursday committed to making climate change a prominent legislative priority if Joe Biden wins the White House and Democrats return to power. Speaking at a news conference as wildfires raged in the West Coast, the Democratic leader said legislation to combat the ""climate crisis"" will be among the top agenda items. ""It is absolutely a priority,"" Pelosi said. PELOSI WARNS 'NO CHANCE' OF US-UK TRADE DEAL IF BREXIT UNDERMINES GOOD FRIDAY ACCORD She said first Democrats will have to address the coronavirus pandemic as she panned President Trump's and the GOP's response as falling way short. But she said climate change legislation will be ""an early part of the agenda"" if Democrats are in power in 2021. She pointed to her first speakership, which started in 2007 under President George W. Bush, when they enacted new legislation to raise fuel economy standards. ""The climate crisis was my flagship issue,"" Pelosi said of that time. ""President Bush was president [and] together we passed the most significant energy bill in the history of our country  the equivalent of taking millions of cars off the road.""

Tucker blasts Dems for insisting without evidence that climate change causing California wildfires,"Democrats are attempting to browbeat Americans into voting for their party by blaming climate change for the devastating wildfires in California, Tucker Carlson charged Friday. ""How did climate change do that?"" asked the ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" host. ""They didn't tell us, but they just kept saying it. In the hands of Democratic politicians, climate change is like systemic racism in the sky. You can't see it, but rest assured it's everywhere and it's deadly. ""And like systemic racism, it is your fault,"" Carlson added. ""The American middle class did it, they cause climate change. They eat too many hamburgers, they drove too many SUVs, they had too many children. A lot of them wear t-shirts to work and didn't finish college and that causes climate change too. FIGHTING CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WILDFIRES WITH REVOLUTIONARY NEW VR TECHNOLOGY ""And worst of all,"" he went on, ""some of them may vote for Donald Trump in November. And if there's anything that absolutely, definitively causes climate change -- and literally over 100% of scientists agree with this established fact -- it is voting for Donald Trump. You might as well start a tire fire in your yard."" Carlson went on to call out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign for echoing the party line. PELOSI ON WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA, WEST: 'MOTHER EARTH IS ANGRY' ""Yesterday, the people on Biden's staff who understand the Internet tweeted out an image of the wildfires along with this message: 'Climate change is already here and we are witnessing its devastating effects every single day. We have to get President Trump out of the White House' ... so once again, by voting for Donald Trump, you are causing climate change, which causes devastating fires,"" Carlson also dismissed Pelosi's comment that the wildfires are a sign that ""Mother Earth is angry"".  ""When was the last time Nancy Pelosi went outside?"" he asked. ""Could she identify a single tree? No one asked her, of course. All we know is what she said -- 'climate change caused this.' Of course it did that. Because no matter what the natural disaster is -- hurricanes, tornadoes, acne, whatever -- climate change did it. In other words, you did it ... ""Now, keep in mind the person telling you this, Nancy Pelosi, owns at least two sub-zero freezers ... They use a lot of energy,"" Carlson pointed out. ""And like Barack Obama, like Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi constantly flies around the country privately between her multi-million dollar estates. So, if she cared about climate change, of course she wouldn't be doing that. She doesn't and neither do her supporters. Otherwise, they'd be massed outside of her estates in anger.""",11/09/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/media/tucker-democrats-california-wildfires-climate-change-pelosi
Democrats say climate change caused wildfire explosion in the West. Did it?,"California, in the middle of a 20-year drought, is battling more than two dozen wildfires, including three of its five largest ever. Cal Fire, the states fire agency, reported Thursday that firefighters were battling 28 major fires across the state and more than 3.1 million acres have burned this year. The sky on much of the West Coast has been painted an eerie burnt orange, and flames have left entire towns in dust. Democrats lay blame on climate change. Mother earth is angry, she is telling us. Whether shes telling us with hurricanes in the Gulf Coast, fires in the West, whatever it is, the climate crisis is real, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week on MSNBC. If anyone needed any proof of how disastrously and quickly climate change is affecting our globe, look out West, Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters this week. The data is self-evident, the experience that we have in the state of California just underscoring the reality of the ravages of climate change, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. He used the fires to push for a more aggressive climate change goal, calling the states already-ambitious goal of using 100% clean energy by 2045 inadequate. But Republicans blame decades of poor land management. California Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen and Assemblyman James Gallagher countered that the cause of recent devastating wildfires and blackouts is decades of bad policy enacted by Democrats, not climate change. The excuse of climate change cannot be used to deflect from the fundamental failure to address the fuels build-up in our forests that are the cause of these devastating fires, they said in a statement. These same misguided policy decisions have led to rolling blackouts and an energy grid that is falling apart. Others lay blame at those who sparked the fire - arsonists in Oregon or a gender reveal party gone wrong in California. Experts point to poor land management, coupled with a population explosion and  dryer, hotter conditions. Logging practices set the scene for todays fires, according to Greg Giusti, forests and wildland ecology expert with the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources. A lot of it has to do with 20th-century logging practices that converted relatively resistant old-growth forests to something else - forests that have a lot more trees per acre and a lot more understory brush and flammable fuels, Giusti told Fox News in an interview. He said the cause of the spark, typically humans, is really irrelevant. When conditions are right any little spark can start a conflagration. Harmful logging practices after World War II were followed by a population explosion in the Golden State. People like their trees, they like to grow their trees, and they don't like to cut trees, which increases the level of burnable material, Giusti said. And while fires are destructive to human property, much of the plant life cycle depends on a burn. A century-long policy of complete and total fire suppression may be boiling over the surface. Many seeds won't germinate unless exposed to the heat of fire, Giusti said. From a human standpoint we look at fires as destructive. But from a plants perspective, fire is often an act of rejuvenation. Whole plant communities are waiting to be burned. Giusti added that while fires threatening human population need to be quelled, some of the flames ripping through national forest land are doing what they've always done. But climate change has exacerbated blazes' intensity, Giusti added. Fewer foggy days on the California coast and a shorter rainy season have left the ground ideal for flames. While Congress pays much lip service to climate change, it is slow to help maintain public lands, which make up nearly half of Californias space, and are owned mostly by the federal government. Timber harvests have in the past been treated as a money-making operations, but the trees that need to be cleared are not lucrative on the commercial market. President Trump signed the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act in August, but before that, 84 million acres of National Park Service land faced billions in backlogged maintenance and repairs. Giusti also noted that firefighting is a huge jobs program on the West Coast. Cal Fire is arguably the best firefighting force in the world. The men and women there put lives on the line every day, Giusti said. But firefighting in the West is a huge jobs program. California spends a half billion per year fighting fire. He called for a paradigm shift, where resources spent on fighting fires would be reallocated to preventing fires. Its going to be a rough pill for some people to swallow, I appreciate that, he said. But areas will keep being ready to burn again if you just let nature take its course.  But one key oversight hinders fire prevention efforts - private land. Firefighters have the ability to enter private land to fight fires, but not to carry out fire prevention efforts. You need the landowners permission and not everybody gives it. Theres a disconnect there, Giusti said.",12/09/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wildfire-democrats-climate-change
"Harris, Newsom blame climate change for California fires following Trump visit","Sen. Kamala Harris visited the wildfire devastation in her home state Tuesday, where she and California Gov. Gavin Newsom blamed climate change for the fires after Trump visited the state and called for better forest management. This is not a partisan issue, the California senator said of the need for action on climate change amid the blazes. An ideology should not kick in. Its just a fact. We have to do better as a country. We have to understand that California, like so many other parts of the country, has experienced extreme weather conditions, the Democratic vice presidential nominee said, pointing to heat, drought and lightning strikes the state has faced in recent weeks. Harris also paid tribute to firefighters in the state. While their own homes are burning... they are working around the clock without rest. I just heard about how they've been working 90-hour shifts, some of them--to save families, to save property, to slow down the fire and its devastation. CALIFORNIA'S NEWSOM THANKS TRUMP FOR HELP WITH FIRES, SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE CONTRIBUTES TO BLAZES  Newsom praised Harris remarks on climate change. Climate change is real. If you don't believe in science, come to California and observe it with your own eyes. You cannot be in denial about this reality. On Monday, President Trump and Newsom met for a roundtable discussion to discuss the flames engulfing the Golden State and much of the West Coast. Newsom thanked the president for the federal help hed given to California, but acknowledged their differing views on the cause of the wildfires. I want to thank you and acknowledge the work you have done to be immediate in your response, Newsom told Trump during the meeting at the Sacramento McClellan Airport. He added that the help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been profoundly significant. LIVE UPDATES: DEADLY WILDFIRES RAGE ACROSS WESTERN STATES At the urging on Newsom back in late August, Trump approved a disaster declaration for California and ordered federal funding to be directed to the state. The president, meanwhile, has repeatedly blamed the state for poor forest management. Hes called on Newsom to ""clean"" or rake the forest floors of debris while suggesting the state implement controlled burns. The president reiterated on Monday that California needs to do better forest management  a remark that Newsom acknowledged. We have not done justice to our forest management, Newsom said. We acknowledge our role and response. Newsom, however, did note that a large portion of the land in California is federally owned and that he believes climate change has drastically contributed to the intensity of the fires. Wildfires have grown increasingly common. California, for instance, recorded 43 from 1980 to 1999  but 300 from 2000 to 2019. Oregon had no wildfires from 1980 to 1999 but 63 over the past 20 years, according to federal data analyzed by the insurance website QuoteWizard. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP  All five of the costliest fires in U.S. history, measured by insured losses, have occurred in the last three years, all in California, according to the Insurance Information Institute.

Harris asks Barrett if COVID-19 is infectious and if smoking causes cancer to make climate change point,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked Judge Amy Coney Barrett if smoking causes cancer and if coronavirus is infectious, in an effort to reveal the Supreme Court nominees thoughts on global climate change.  After an extended intro where Harris talked about John Lewis, racism and voter discrimination, the Democratic vice presidential nominee asked Barrett if she agreed with Chief Justice John Roberts when he said voter discrimination still exists.  Barrett said there have been certain, specific instances of voter discrimination.  I will not comment on what any justice said in an opinion, whether an opinion is right or wrong, or endorse that proposition, Barrett said, following her stance from the rest of the week where shes refused to divulge opinions on any hot-button court cases.  Do you accept that COVID-19 is infectious? Harris asked. Yes, Barrett replied. Its an obvious fact, yes. LIVE UPDATES: AMY CONEY BARRETT CONFIRMATION HEARING Do you accept that smoking causes cancer? Harris continued. Im not sure where exactly youre going with this but... Sen. Harris yes every package of cigarettes warns that smoking causes cancer, the judge said Do you believe that climate change is happening and is threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink? Harris asked.  Barrett responded: Senator, again, I was wondering where you were going with that, you have asked me a series of questions that are completely uncontroversial like whether COVID-19 is infectious, whether smoking causes cancer and then trying to analogize that to eliciting an opinion from me that is on a very contentious matter of public debate."" I will not do that. I will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially one that is politically controversial because thats inconsistent with the judicial rule as I have explained, she continued. Thank you, Judge Barrett, you've made your point clear that you believe it is a debatable point, Harris said.  Later, Harris said she was disappointed with Barrett's noncommittal answers. ""There were a lot of unanswered questions frankly and that's unfortunate,"" she told reporters as she departed her Capitol Hill office.  Earlier Wednesday, Barrett said she doesnt have firm views on climate change.  Ive read about climate change, Barrett told Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.  BARRETT TELLS DEMOCRATIC SENATOR: 'I HOPE YOU AREN'T SUGGESTING I DON'T HAVE MY OWN MIND' And you have some opinions on climate change that youve thought about? Kennedy asked.  Im certainly not a scientist, Barrett replied. Ive read things about climate change. I would not say that I have firm views on it."" Pressed on the matter by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Barrett said she didnt think her views on climate change were relevant to the job.  ""I don't think that my views on global warming or climate change are relevant to the job I would do as a judge nor do I feel like I have views that are informed enough, and I haven't studied scientific data. I'm not really in a position to offer any kind of informed opinion,"" she said. Blumenthal asked Barrett if she agreed with President Trumps views on climate change. ""I don't know that I have seen the president's expression of his views on climate change, she replied.  After casting doubt on the matter, Trump seemed to come around to the idea that climate change is caused by humans. When asked if he thinks climate change is a hoax in January, Trump said, ""Nothing's a hoax about that. It's a very serious subject. I want clean air; I want clean water. I want the cleanest air with the cleanest water. The environment's very important to me. In his first debate with Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trump was asked whether  greenhouse gas emissions from humans contribute to the planet's warming.

"Climate change is responsible for half of the Great Barrier Reef being lost, study warns","Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been severely damaged over the years, as widespread bleaching caused by rising temperatures and climate change negatively impact the structure. Now, a new study has put a firm figure on just how much of the reef has been lost over the past 25 years. A staggering 50%. The research, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society, looked at coral communities and the size of the colony between 1995 and 2017 and found that nearly all of the coral populations suffered depletions of various amounts. GREAT BARRIER REEF SEES MOST WIDESPREAD BLEACHING EVER RECORDED, SCIENTISTS SAY ""We measured changes in colony sizes because population studies are important for understanding demography and the corals' capacity to breed,"" study lead Andy Dietzel said in a statement.  ""We found the number of small, medium and large corals on the Great Barrier Reef has declined by more than 50% since the 1990s,"" study co-author Terry Hughes added. Two of the worst bleaching events took place recently, in 2016 and 2017, due in part to high temperatures, the researchers added. In April, a separate group of researchers said the reef suffered its most widespread bleaching ever recorded. In August 2019, the government agency that manages Australia's Great Barrier Reef downgraded its outlook for the corals' condition from ""poor"" to ""very poor"" due to warming oceans.  Coral reefs, and in particular, the Great Barrier Reef, are home to a diverse number of species and are considered some of the most vibrant ecosystems anywhere on Earth.  According to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Great Barrier Reef makes up about 10 percent of the world's coral reef ecosystems. It also has more than 1,500 species of fish and over 400 species of hard coral and contributes ""more than $6.4 billion each year to the Australian economy and around 64,000 full-time jobs."" CLIMATE CHANGE AND POLLUTION COULD ELIMINATE NEARLY ALL CORAL REEFS BY END OF CENTURY ""A vibrant coral population has millions of small, baby corals, as well as many large ones  the big mamas who produce most of the larvae,"" Dietzel added. ""Our results show the ability of the Great Barrier Reef to recover  its resilience  is compromised compared to the past, because there are fewer babies, and fewer large breeding adults."" The research shows that the Great Barrier Reef's size is no longer able to protect it from the ravages of warmer ocean temperatures, the experts said. ""We used to think the Great Barrier Reef is protected by its sheer size  but our results show that even the world's largest and relatively well-protected reef system is increasingly compromised and in decline,"" Hughes said. DYING CORAL REEFS COULD BE SAVED BY PLAYING SOUNDS OF HEALTHY CORAL REEFS FROM SPEAKERS Skeptics have largely dismissed fears over mans impact on global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time. They also claim the dangers of a warming planet are being wildly exaggerated and question the impact that fossil fuels have had on climate change.

Kerry vows to treat climate change as 'urgent national security threat',"After four years on the sidelines, John Kerry is getting back into politics to combat climate change. America will soon have a government that treats the climate crisis as the urgent national security threat it is, the former secretary of state and former longtime senator from Massachusetts tweeted on Monday after President-elect Joe Biden announced hell name Kerry as the incoming administrations presidential envoy for climate. BIDEN UNVEILS TOP CABINET AND ADMINISTRATION PICKS Kerry will fight climate change full-time as Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and will sit on the National Security Council, read a statement from Bidens transition team. Biden's move puts a spotlight on his commitment to elevate the issue of climate change in his administration. The president-elect, who emphasized throughout his White House run his commitment to combat climate change, said soon after this months election that the battle to save the climate was among his top five priorities. Kerry, as secretary of state during President Obamas second term, was a key member of the team that hammered out the Paris Climate Accord. President Trump, in his first year in the White House, pledged to pull the U.S. out of the global agreement, and that move was finalized earlier this month. The president reiterated this past weekend during the G20 summit that the accord was designed to kill the American economy rather than protect the environment. Biden, as a candidate and now as president-elect, has pledged to return the U.S. to the accord on day one of his presidency. BIDEN SECRETARY OF STATE PICK BLINKEN CRITICIZED FOR EARLY IRAQ WAR SUPPORT Bidens transition team highlighted that Secretary Kerry elevated environmental challenges as diplomatic priorities, from oceans to hydrofluorocarbons. He was a key architect of the Paris Climate Accord, and signed the historic agreement to reduce carbon emissions with his granddaughter on his lap. Kerry wrote on Twitter that I'm proud to partner with the President-elect, our allies, and the young leaders of the climate movement to take on this crisis as the President's Climate Envoy. Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee who narrowly lost his bid for the White House to Republican President George W. Bush, briefly mulled another presidential run in the 2020 cycle. But he soon became a leading supporter and surrogate for Biden during the Democratic primaries. After Biden became the partys presumptive presidential nominee, the former vice president and his final rival, progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, set up unity task forces on key policy agenda. Kerry co-chaired the climate change task force alongside progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Justice Democrats, a progressive group allied with both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, said in a statement that we are encouraged by Joe Biden making one of his first major appointments John Kerry as Climate Czar as it demonstrates the urgency of taking bold, global action on the climate crisis. But the group added that America also needs a domestically-focused Climate Czar. The Sunrise Movement, a progressive group that advocates for political action to combat climate change, called Kerrys announcement an encouraging sign of President-Elect Bidens commitment to addressing the climate crisis and said they applaud President-elect Biden for making history with this appointment and congratulate Secretary John Kerry. But the group joined with Justice Democrats in adding that the next White House must also include a counterpart reporting directly to the President to lead an Office of Climate Mobilization, who can marshal, convene, and push federal agencies, departments, states &amp; local governments, industry, and civil society to use every tool at their disposal to address the climate crisis.

Hindsight in 2020: Report says dire climate predictions have failed to materialize,"The year 2020 is ending as it began in some ways -- with politicians sounding the alarm over the ""existential threat"" of climate change and its allegedly catastrophic impacts. But, as many have noted, predictions of climate devastation have historically included major flops. In previous decades, media reports and scientists issued warnings about glaciers disappearing in Montana, carbon concentrations intensifying, heavy snowfalls becoming sparse, and global temperature spiking by 2020. But according to the right-leaning JunkScience.com, none of those panned out and, in some cases, the polar opposite turned out to be true. DOOMSDAYS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN: THINK TANK COMPILES DECADES' WORTH OF DIRE CLIMATE PREDICTIONS Perhaps the most glaring of failed predictions involved vanishing snow and ice in the north. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2009 on a government ecologist's prediction that all of Montana's glaciers would be gone in 2020.  The reality? As recently as January, Montana's Glacier National Park was reportedly replacing signs with that very warning. CNN reported: ""In 2017, the park was told by the agency that the complete melting off of the glaciers was no longer expected to take place so quickly due to changes in the forecast model, [park spokeswoman Gina] Kurzmen said. But tight maintenance budgets made it impossible for the park to immediately change the signs."" Other reports relayed predictions that ""Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past"" (The Independent in 2000), ""Snows of Kilimanjaro to Vanish by 2020"" (The Vancouver Sun in 2008), and ""Arctic summers may be ice free by 2020"" (Lancaster Eagle-Gazette in 2013). TOP 5 MOST OUTRAGEOUS 2020 DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS THAT DIDN'T PAN OUT As JunkScience.com's report notes, the Artctic still had plenty of ice in September, and the famous African volcano had defied former Vice President Al Gore's 2006 prediction that ""within a decade, there will be no more snows of Kilimanjaro."" Meanwhile, Florida has maintained a sea level rise of less than 4 inches, despite an earlier prediction it could see an increase of 2 feet by 2020.  In 1987, the Star-Phoenix reported on NASA scientist James Hansen's warning that by the end of the 90s, average global temperature increases would reach between one-half and 1 degree Celsius.  After quoting Hansen predicting unprecedented warmth in the following decades, the paper said: ""If this proves true, by the year 2020 we will experience an average temperature increase of around three degrees, with even greater extremes."" It also noted that ""more conservative scientists believe a change list this will not happen until the middle of the 21st Century."" While the climate for 2050 is unknown, 2020 has already turned out slightly better than Hansen predicted. Data obtained by JunkScience.com showed the global average temperature was higher by 0.44 degrees Celsius. 10 TIMES 'EXPERTS' PREDICTED THE WORLD WOULD END BY NOW The increase in global CO2 concentration (about 23% from 1978 to 2020) also fell short of a prediction that it would double by 2020. ""We learn that if present trends continue, with economics the only limit on the exploitation of fossil fuels, the CO2 concentration will have doubled by 2020,"" said a 1978 article in The Vancouver Sun. Predictions like these are often held up as evidence that alarmist predictions about climate change shouldn't be taken seriously. However, these arguments have encountered pushback from critics who argue that some climate models were accurate, and discrepancies can at least partially be attributed to the types of regulations activists are seeking as a response to warming. It's unclear just how effective those regulations have been. In 2019, the United Nations released a global assessment of environmental rules and noted that poor enforcement hindered their success. Heartland Institute Director Steve Milloy, who also runs JunkScience.com, told Fox News that the push for policy interventions has failed. ""The world has spent trillions on climate without any obvious benefit  to the environment, climate, public health, or economy,"" he said. A study from Yale University, however, argued that environmental regulations have curbed emissions even as the U.S. saw a ""substantial increase in manufacturing output"" from 1990 to 2008. AL GORE CLAIMS HIS CLIMATE-CHANGE PREDICTIONS ABOUT 2016 HAVE NOW COME TRUE At end of last year, researchers from NASA, the University of California, Berkeley, and the Massachussetts Institute of Technology released a study on climate models published between 1970 and 2007. ""We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers,"" the group said.  The study specifically looked at 17 models, finding that 10 closely matched observations. That number jumped to 14 when the researchers accounted for differences between modeled and actual changes in carbon dioxide.   The Heartland Institute has received criticism over its funding, which has included money from ExxonMobil. The right-leaning think tank does not publicly identify its donors but defends itself by claiming that while donors can influence their research agenda, they ""do not surrender control over the peer review process."" It also claims that ""[d]uring 2019, The Heartland Institute raised approximately $4.6 million in support from approximately 2,000 individual, foundation, and corporate supporters. Its 2019 income came from the following sources: Foundations 67%, individuals 27%, corporations 5%. Over the years, no corporate donor has contributed more than 5% of Heartland's total receipts.""",16/12/2020,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hindsight-is-2020-failed-climate-predictions
Cal Thomas: Biden's climate change litmus test,"From the looks of President-elect Joe Biden's selections for cabinet positions and other high offices it seems belief in ""climate change"" has become a litmus test. Biden appears to have raised climate change to the level of a religious doctrine. In naming John Kerry a climate ""czar,"" Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., to head the Dept. of the Interior -- if confirmed Haaland would become the first Native American cabinet secretary in history, a diversity priority for Biden -- and Michael Regan, head of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality, who would be the first Black man to lead EPA (ditto on diversity), Biden has signaled he is all-in on using government to change the climate, which some believe is already improving because of technology and innovation in the private sector. Here is a fundamental question: If Biden thinks government has the power to change the climate (it doesn't), why hasn't government been able to prevent hurricanes and other natural disasters? COVID-19 is being used by politicians -- nearly all of them Democrats -- to erode our liberties. If given the power to dictate what we drive, the type of house we can live in and other freedoms we have long taken for granted, government will not be able to resist adding even more demands in the name of saving the planet. 7 THINGS JOE BIDEN PROMISED TO DO HIS FIRST DAY IN OFFICE At the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, climate change disciples laid out their vision for America's future. By 2030, some forecast: -- The U.S. will not be the world's leading superpower. -- A billion people will be displaced by climate change. -- Polluters will have to pay to emit carbon dioxide. -- There will be a global price on carbon (and) this will help make fossil fuels history. If these initiatives are enacted, it will turn the United States into something other than what we have enjoyed for two centuries. Some comments by the Davos attendees dismissed the notion that a majority of citizens should decide such crucial matters, leaving decisions instead to unaccountable elites. This is the stuff of dictatorship, little different from what communist leaders have done in the past, and in the present in China. BIDEN NOW SAYS IT WILL TAKE 'SIX MONTHS' TO REVERSE TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICIES  President-elect Biden has called climate change a ""crisis."" How many crises can we deal with at one time? I thought COVID-19 was a crisis. How about getting that under control before we start addressing climate, which is changing, but for the better in some places and probably in the U.S. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER According to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organization ""committed to shaping a secure and sustainable energy future for all,"" ""The United States saw the largest decline in energy-related CO2 emissions in 2019 on a country basis - a fall of 140 Mt, or 2.9 percent, to 4.8 Gt. U.S. emissions are now down almost 1 Gt from their peak in the year 2000, the largest absolute decline by any country over that period."" Opinion polls have been all over the place on this issue. Prior to the election, an NPR/PBS News Hour Marist poll found climate change taking over the top spot of concerns for Democrats. The economy remained the number one issue for Republicans with climate change not registering among those polled.  The media will join politicians and some ""experts"" to promote climate change during the Biden administration, including end-of-the-world scenarios with little or no scientific information that contradicts their line. Two years ago, ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd announced he would not have any guests on who doubted climate change. This is censorship and the promotion of a single point of view constitutes indoctrination. Implementing the Biden climate doctrine will cost a fortune and result in an outcome most Americans will not like.

"John Kerry's family still owns private jet as he leads climate fight, FAA records indicate","Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records indicate that the family of U.S. Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry owns a private jet, despite his position on combatting fossil fuels in the new administration. The FAA's registry shows a Gulfstream Aerospace jet owned by Flying Squirrel LLC, the name previously reported for Teresa Heinz-Kerry's private charter jet company. The company's listed address matches that of the Heinz Family Foundation. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. Neither did the Heinz family office.  According to FAA records, the jet's registration certificate was issued in July of 2005 and expires in October of 2023. While it's unclear exactly how much Kerry benefited from his wife's company, private jets have been estimated to emit upward of 40 times as much carbon per passenger as commercial flights. CLIMATE CZAR NOMINEE JOHN KERRY UNDER FIRE FOR PRIVATE JET USE ""We look forward to the anti-carbon lectures from a guy who travels the globe on private jets and luxury yachts,"" read a New York Post editorial last year. During his 2004 presidential run, Kerry's campaign made 60 payments to his wife's charter jet company, totaling $273,171, the New York Post reported. As late as 2013, his executive branch personnel financial disclosure showed Kerry owning ""over $1,000,001"" in assets for ""Flying Squirrel LLC"" through his wife.

Biden signs climate change orders amid concerns over jobs: 'It is time to act',"President Biden on Wednesday signed executive orders on climate change as he vowed to put the issue ""at the center"" of U.S. national security and domestic and foreign policy. At a White House ceremony, Biden said the orders would ""supercharge"" his administrations plan for dealing with climate change. BIDEN CLIMATE CHANGE ORDER TO TELL FEDERAL AGENCIES TO ELIMINATE FOSSIL FUEL SUBSIDIES ""Today is climate day at the White House, which means today is jobs day at the White House,"" Biden said, adding that the focus of the administration is ""American products,"" the ""health of our families, cleaner water and cleaner air."" ""In my view, weve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis and we cant wait any longer. It is time to act,"" Biden said, as he outlined his executive actions. ""Just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis, because there is a climate crisis."" Biden added: ""When I think of climate, I think of jobs."" Biden said that climate change is a case ""where conscience and convenience cross paths, saying ""dealing with the existential threats to the plant and economic growth are one in the same."" The president said the U.S. ""can put millions of Americans to work modernizing our eater systems, transportations, and energy infrastructure."" But Republicans have strongly pushed back at Bidens policies, including his order to ban new oil and gas leasing on federal lands, claiming they are job killers. ""America has become the world leader in energy production and a major exporter of oil and natural gas, strengthening our national security and boosting our economy for hard-working families,"" House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and 30 GOP members of the House Energy Action Team said in a statement Wednesday. ""In less than a week, the Biden Administration has placed these jobs and accomplishments at risk by waging an assault on American energy, as well as the good jobs and low energy costs that go with it."" Bidens order on Wednesday is set to ""empower"" American workers and businesses to ""lead a clean energy revolution"" that aims to achieve a carbon pollution-free sector by 2035, while putting the U.S. on an ""irreversible path to a net-zero economy by 2050."" The order will expand on his move last week to rejoin the Paris climate agreement. His review of ""harmful rollbacks of standards"" that protect air, water and communities is set to direct federal agencies to ""eliminate fossil fuel subsidies as consistent with applicable law and identify new opportunities to spur innovation, commercialization, and deployment of clean energy technologies and infrastructure."" As for jobs, the order, according to the White House, is ""consistent with the goals of the Presidents Build Back Better jobs and economic recovery plan,"" saying that clean energy jobs is a ""central pillar."" The orders direct federal agencies to procure carbon pollution-free electricity, and clean, zero-emission vehicles to create good-paying union jobs and ""stimulate clean energy industries."" The order also ""requires those purchases to be Made in America,"" while ""strictly"" enforcing wage and benefits guidelines. ""These actions reaffirm that agencies should work to ensure that any jobs created with funds to address the climate crisis are good jobs with a choice to join a union,"" the White House said. BIDEN TO BAN NEW PERMITS FOR DRILLING ON FEDERAL LANDS, WATERS FOR ONE YEAR The order also ""catalyzes"" the creation of jobs in construction, manufacturing, engineering and the skilled-trades by directing steps to ensure that every federal infrastructure investment reduces climate pollution and that steps are taken to accelerate clean energy and transmission projects under federal siting and permitting processes in an environmentally sustainable manner. Biden, from the White House on Wednesday, also maintained that ""we are not going to ban fracking."" Fracking is a process, which involves injecting water into shale rock at high pressure to extract natural gas, and has revolutionized the oil and gas industry by allowing producers to reach large quantities within shale rock that were previously unattainable and cost-prohibitive to drill. As a result, oil and gas production in the U.S. has nearly tripled over the past decade. More than 95% of new wells use hydraulic fracking, accounting for about two-thirds of natural gas production and half of oil output in 2018, according to the American Petroleum Institute. The order, according to the White House, establishes climate considerations as an ""essential element"" of U.S. foreign policy and national security. ""This is a whole of government approach to put climate change at center of domestic policy, national security and foreign policy,"" Biden said. The order affirms that the U.S. ""will exercise its leadership to promote a significant increase in global ambition,"" while making clear that ""both significant short-term global emission reductions and net-zero global emissions by mid-centuryor beforeare required to avoid setting the world on a dangerous, potentially catastrophic, climate trajectory."" The order will also commit Biden to hosting a Leaders Climate Summit on Earth Day, April 22, 2021; the U.S. to reconvene the Major Economies Forum; and to underscore the administrations commitment to elevating climate in U.S. foreign policy. Meanwhile, the order also directs Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to prepare a National Intelligence Estimate on the security implications of climate change, the State Department to prepare a transmittal package to the Senate for the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal protocol, and all agencies to develop strategies for integrating climate considerations into their international work. The order also formally establishes the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, creating a central office in the White House that is charged with coordinating and implementing Bidens domestic climate agenda. With regard to agriculture, the order directs the secretary of agriculture to to ""collect input from farmers, ranchers, and other stakeholders"" on how to use federal programs to ""encourage adoption of climate- smart agricultural practices that produce verifiable carbon reductions and sequestrations and create new sources of income and jobs for rural Americans."" Bidens order also directs the secretary of the interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters to the extent possible, launch a rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel development on public lands and waters, and identify steps that can be taken to double renewable energy production from offshore wind by 2030. The White House said the order ""formalizes"" Bidens ""commitment"" to making environmental justice part of the mission of each federal agency, by directing them to develop programs, policies and activities to address the disproportionate health, environmental, economic, and climate impacts on disadvantaged communities. The order creates a government-wide ""Justice40 Initiative"" with the goal of delivering ""40 percent of the overall benefits of relevant federal investments to disadvantaged communities."" Meanwhile, Biden is also set to sign a presidential memorandum on Wednesday focused on scientific integrity, in an effort to ""send a clear message"" that his administration ""will protect scientists from political interference"" so that they can ""think, research, and speak freely to provide valuable information and insights to the American people."" Biden, on Wednesday, also signed an executive order to re-establish the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. The council is set to also advise Biden on scientific and technical information needed to ""inform public policy relating to the economy, worker empowerment, education, energy, environment, public health, national and homeland security, racial equity, and other topics.""",27/01/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-signs-climate-change-orders
Climate change is now a national security priority for the Pentagon,"The Pentagon will now be prioritizing climate change as a national security threat, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday. The priority marks a distinct reversal from the Trump administration which made no such declarations on the issue. The announcement came shortly after President Joe Biden issued a flurry of executive orders to cut oil, gas, and coal emissions and double energy production from offshore wind turbines. In a statement, Austin said the Defense Department ""will immediately take appropriate policy actions to prioritize climate change considerations in our activities and risk assessments, to mitigate this driver of insecurity. As directed by the President, we will include the security implications of climate change in our risk analyses, strategy development, and planning guidance."" Austin said the Pentagon will also incorporate climate risk analysis into modeling, simulation, wargaming, analysis, and the Next Defense Strategy. He noted that by changing how it approaches its own carbon footprint, the Pentagon  one of the largest fossil fuel consumers in the U.S.  ""can be a platform for positive change, spurring the development of climate-friendly technologies at scale."" ""There is little about what the Department does to defend the American people that is not affected by climate change,"" Austin said. ""It is a national security issue, and we must treat it as such."" AS BIDEN'S KEYSTONE XL ORDER SPARKS JOB LOSSES, CLIMATE ADVISER SAYS, 'WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR SACRIFICE' President Bidens executive orders target federal subsidies for oil and other fossil fuels and halt new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. They also aim to conserve 30% of the country's lands and ocean waters in the next 10 years and move to an all-electric federal vehicle fleet. Biden's sweeping plan is aimed at slowing human-caused climate change, but it also carries a political risk for the president and Democrats as oil- and coal-producing states face job losses from moves to sharply increase U.S. reliance on clean energy such as wind and solar power.  ""We can't wait any longer'' to address the climate crisis, Biden said at the White House. ""We see with our own eyes. We know it in our bones. It is time to act.''

Hannity challenges Biden to ground government jets to support climate change agenda,"Joe Biden and members of his administration should practice what they preach about climate change and decline to fly on their environmentally-unfriendly fleet of jets, Sean Hannity suggested Thursday.

""Stop flying on the private jets that we, the American taxpayers, are paying for?""

The host went on to suggest that instead of stripping thousands of Americans of their livelihood by canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline, Kerry should ground his plane permanently and recycle the pieces. ""That jet pollutes more in a given year than most Americans in their entire lives,"" he said. ""How about he orders that his private jet be grounded and ... he should have it disassembled so it can never be used again.""  Hannity emphasized that the Democratic Party has ""zero compassion"" for Americas working class after recklessly depriving them of good-paying, career energy jobs.

Biden administration cites climate change as a 'racial justice issue',"Gina McCarthy, National Climate Adviser for President Biden, said climate change  a priority for the administration  is also a racial justice issue. In a video addressing the intersectionality of climate change posted over the weekend, McCarthy explained that the issue ""exacerbates the challenges in the communities that have been left behind."" ""It goes after the very same communities that pollution has held back and racism has held back,"" McCarthy said. ""Climate justice is about equal rights."" The poorest and most vulnerable communities  or the ones that have not been invested in  tend to feel the effects of the climate crisis more than affluent areas. LAID-OFF KEYSTONE XL WORKER ON BIDEN'S NEW CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES: THEY JUST DONT CARE For example, ""cancer alley""  a stretch of industrial plants in Louisiana  is home to chemical plants and dangerous air pollution, as well as minority and poor communities. These communities may also have fewer resources to deal with the effects of climate change  including owning items like air conditioners to cope with heat waves. McCarthy added that promoting clean energy initiatives will also benefit U.S. economic growth by creating good-paying jobs, as well as union jobs.  McCarthy, who is from Massachusetts, led the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama. Biden has made it clear that addressing the climate crisis will be a focal point for his administration. The president has already reversed some of former President Donald Trumps actions, including Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization.",01/02/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-calls-climate-change-is-a-racial-justice-issue
Biden agriculture secretary nominee wants farmers on front line of climate change fight,"Agriculture Secretary nominee Tom Vilsack touted the ability that American farmers have to drive the country's progress when it comes to climate change. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee on Tuesday, Ranking Member Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., asked about what could be done on the agriculture front to help the climate, which has quickly become the key issue for the Biden administration. Vilsack was enthusiastic about the potential farmers have. SCHUMER SUGGESTS BIDEN DECLARE 'CLIMATE EMERGENCY' ""I think agriculture is probably the first and best way to begin getting some wins in this climate area,"" Vilsack said. ""I think farmers are prepared for it, farmers are anxious to do it."" Stabenow is a co-sponsor of the Senates Growing Climate Solutions Act, a bipartisan bill that aims to help farmer participate in carbon markets, whereby those who reduce their carbon emissions below a certain level can earn credits that can then be sold to others who need produce higher levels of carbon  a process known as ""cap and trade."" JOHN KERRY FAMILY PRIVATE JET EMITTED ESTIMATED 116 METRIC TONS OF CARBON OVER PAST YEAR Vilsack agreed that a system that incentivizes action will see support from farmers. ""If it's voluntary, if it's market-based, if it's incentive-based, I think you will see farmers, ranchers, and producers cooperate extensively,"" he said. In the meantime, he said, there are already proposals that can be acted upon on the administrative end. These include making sure that any potential measures benefit farmers and not third parties, and forming an advisory group of farmers that would focus on how to structure carbon sequestration  a method of drawing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  Vilsack said the government also needs to improve when it comes to researching carbon sequestration. ""There are ways in which root systems of crops can potentially be designed in a way that will sequester more carbon,"" he said. ""We ought to be exploring that, we ought to be looking at ways in which we can increase market opportunities for greater storage.""",02/02/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-agriculture-secretary-nominee-farmers-climate-change-fight
"John Kerry took private jet to Iceland for environmental award, called it 'only choice for somebody like me'","President Biden's recently appointed climate czar, John Kerry, took a private jet to Iceland in 2019 to receive the Arctic Circle award for climate leadership, Fox News has learned.  Kerry defended his high-pollution ride at the time, calling it ""the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle"" in an interview obtained by Fox News. The incident had not been previously reported in the American press. Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, who led the Arctic Circle Roundtable, criticized Kerry for traveling to the event via private jet, Icelandic outlet RUV reported. Kerry received the award, which took the form of an iceberg sculpture, for being ""a consistent voice pressuring the American authorities to commit to tackle environmental matters,"" the outlet noted. Icelandic reporter Johann Bjarni Kolbeinsson confronted Kerry at the event over his choice of transportation, asking: ""I understand that you came here with a private jet. Is that an environmental way to travel?"" Kerry responded by claiming that it was the only way.  ""If you offset your carbon -- it's the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle,"" Kerry said. ""I negotiated the Paris Accords for the United States,"" he added, referring to the multilateral climate agreement signed while he was secretary of state under President Obama. ""I've been involved with this fight for years. I negotiated with [Chinese] President Xi to bring President Xi to the table so we could get Paris. And, I believe, the time it takes me to get somewhere, I can't sail across the ocean. I have to fly, meet with people and get things done,"" Kerry said, sidestepping the fact that he chose a private jet over a commercial flight.  JOHN KERRY'S FAMILY STILL OWNS PRIVATE JET AS HE LEADS CLIMATE FIGHT, FAA RECORDS INDICATE ""But, what I'm doing, almost full time,"" he continued, ""is working to win the battle on climate change, and in the end, if I offset and contribute my life to do this, I'm not going to be put on the defensive."" Private jets have been estimated to emit upward of 40 times as much carbon per passenger as commercial flights. It's unclear how Kerry has been offsetting his carbon output, as he claimed, but flight logs indicated that his family's private jet spent over 20 hours in the air over the past year -- culminating in an estimated 116 metric tons of carbon emissions.  For comparison, a March 2018 report from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that the typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. That calculation assumed a car that drives around 11,500 miles per year with a fuel economy of about 22.0 miles per gallon. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. As Fox News previously noted, the Kerry family owned a private charter jet company from which the longtime Democrat appeared to benefit financially. As late as 2013, his executive branch personnel financial disclosure showed Kerry owning ""over $1,000,001"" in assets for the charter company Flying Squirrel LLC through his wife Teresa Heinz Kerry, heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune. JOHN KERRY FAMILY PRIVATE JET EMITTED 116 METRIC TONS OF CARBON OVER PAST YEAR Kerry's financial disclosures from 2009-2012 also showed that amount. In his 2013 disclosure, the former secretary of state reported between ""$50,001-$100,000"" in rent and royalties for the company. That figure was over $1 million in his 2012 form and between $100,001-$1,000,000 for 2013. Other disclosures showed rental income of over $1 million for 2011, ""$100,001-$1,000,000"" for 2010, and ""$100,001-$1,000,000"" for 2008. Revelations about Kerry's outsized carbon footprint came as Democrats have considered proposals to overhaul the nation's energy economy, with potentially skyrocketing costs for households and individual Americans. Biden's climate proposal is estimated to cost at least $1.7 trillion. That could grow, however, depending on how Democrats negotiate with him in Congress, where progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been adamant about passing the ambitious Green New Deal. During the campaign, Biden said he would use the Green New Deal as a framework for his climate plan, although his proposal cost significantly less than other plans that adopted that framework. Regardless, Biden's plan aims for the type of economy-wide transformation advocated by more left-leaning members of his party. BIDEN PUSHES GREEN ENERGY AGENDA AFTER CAMPAIGN DONATIONS FROM GREEN INDUSTRY That included achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, which the Heritage Foundation has said would cost the economy millions of jobs, thousands of dollars in lost household income, and trillions erased from the nation's gross domestic product. The conservative nonprofit used the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) National Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.  Not only did the model crash, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the GND. The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58% reduction in emissions, achieved through a $300 carbon tax  -- taxes above $300 crashed the EIA's model. It estimated that just a 58% reduction would, by 2040, cost the economy $15 trillion in lost gross domestic product and an average of 1.1 million jobs per year. The average family of four would also see a total income loss of $165,000, or nearly $8,000 each year. Within just weeks of assuming power, the Biden administration had already cost American jobs by revoking the federal permit for constructing the Keystone XL pipeline. TC Energy, the company that owns the pipeline, warned on Inauguration Day that doing so would ""directly lead to the layoff of thousands of union workers."" Rob Darden, CEO at Distribution Contractors Association (DCA), similarly said completing the pipeline ""would have created 10,000 good-paying American union jobs.""  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., maintain that the cost of inaction on climate change is unsustainable. According to Sanders, solutions like infrastructure and investment would boost the U.S. economy as well. Biden's campaign website predicted his climate response could create 10 million ""well-paying jobs."" Sanders previously warned that without action on climate change, the U.S. would ""lose $34.5 trillion by the end of the century."" He also predicted savings as high as $70.4 trillion over 80 years by ""averting climate catastrophe.""",03/02/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/john-kerry-private-jet-iceland-climate-award
Climate refugees? Biden executive order wants study on resettling those 'displaced' by climate change,"President Bidens recent executive order on refugees includes a direction for a study on the impacts of climate change on migration, as well as options for the ""protection and resettlement of individuals"" displaced by environmental change. The order for the study comes in a Feb. 4 order on ""Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration."" HOUSE REPUBLICANS CAUTION BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AGAINST WEAKENING VETTING OF REFUGEES The study will be led by the national security adviser, in consultation with the secretaries of State, Defense and Homeland Security -- along with USAID and the director of national intelligence -- and will be on ""climate change and its impact on migration, including forced migration, internal displacement, and planned relocation."" The order says the report will include ""discussion of the international security implications of climate-related migration"" as well as ""options for protection and resettlement of individuals displaced directly or indirectly from climate change."" The request for the report comes as part of the effort by Biden to increase the number of refugees taken in by the U.S. each year. Former President Donald Trump lowered the cap to 15,000, and Biden is moving to increase that to 125,000 for the next fiscal year. The order also requests ""mechanisms for identifying such individuals, including through referrals"" and ""proposals for how these findings should affect use of United States foreign assistance to mitigate the negative impact of climate change"" as well as how the U.S. can work with international groups and NGOs. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S CBP REVIVES 'CATCH AND RELEASE' POLICY AT BORDER AMID COVID CONCERNS  While it isnt clear what the report would conclude, or what the Biden administration would do as a result of the report, activists and some Democrats have long been calling for the U.S. to help ""climate migrants."" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., included in his Democratic presidential platform a policy to ""welcome migrants displaced by climate change"" and push to accept a minimum of 50,000 ""climate migrants"" in his first year in office. Any such move is likely to be strongly opposed by Republicans, who have expressed concern about any broader definition of refugees.  More than two dozen Republicans, in a letter first obtained by Fox News, wrote to the administration expressing concern about the vetting of refugees -- and included concern about the report.  ""We remind you that so-called climate refugees are not included in the definition of refugee at Section 101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a definition which is consistent with U.S. obligations under relevant international instruments,"" the letter says. ""The Biden administration must not seek to expand this definition through administrative action, nor should it participate in the attempts by certain activist groups to expand the traditional and legal understanding of refugee,"" the letter also says.",11/02/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-refugees-biden-executive-order-climate-change
Tucker Carlson: The great Texas climate catastrophe is heading your way,"The Green New Deal has come, believe it or not, to the state of Texas. How's it working out so far? Well, the good news is all that alternative energy seems to have had a remarkable effect on the climate. Sunday night, parts of Texas got the temperatures that we typically see in Alaska. In fact, they were the same as they were in Alaska. So global warming is no longer a pressing concern in Houston.  The bad news is, they don't have electricity. The windmills froze, so the power grid failed. Millions of Texans woke up Monday morning having to boil their water because with no electricity, it couldn't be purified. The ironically named Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the grid, had no solution to any of this. They simply told people to stop using so much power to keep warm. So in Houston, hundreds of shivering Texans headed to the convention center like refugees to keep from freezing to death. Some Texans almost certainly did freeze to death. Later this week, we'll likely learn just how many more were killed as they tried to keep warm with jury-rigged heaters and barbecues and car exhaust. DEADLY TEXAS WINTER STORM LEAVES MILLIONS WITHOUT POWER AMID FRIGID TEMPERATURES That happens every time when the power goes out; even advanced societies become primitive and dangerous, and people die. We've seen it happen repeatedly in California for years now, rolling blackouts in a purportedly First World state that is slipping steadily into chaos. But who saw that coming in Texas? If there's one thing you would think Texas would be able to do, it's keep the lights on. Most electricity comes from natural gas and Texas produces more of that than any place on the continent. There are huge natural gas deposits all over the state. Running out of energy in Texas is like starving to death at the grocery store: You can only do it on purpose, and Texas did. Rather than celebrate and benefit from their state's vast natural resources, politicians took the fashionable route and became recklessly reliant on so-called alternative energy, meaning windmills. Fifteen years ago, there were virtually no wind farms in Texas. Last year, roughly a quarter of all electricity generated in the state came from wind. Local politicians were pleased by this. They bragged about it like there was something virtuous about destroying the landscape and degrading the power grid. Just last week, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott proudly accepted something called the Wind Leadership Award, given with gratitude by Tri Global Energy, a company getting rich from green energy. So it was all working great until the day it got cold outside. The windmills failed like the silly fashion accessories they are, and people in Texas died. This is not to beat up on the state of Texas -- it's a great state, actually -- but to give you some sense of what's about to happen to you. BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER WANTS STUDY ON RESETTLING THOSE 'DISPLACED' BY CLIMATE CHANGE Here's President Biden last month: BIDEN, JAN. 27: In my view, weve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis ... Thats why Im signing today an executive order to supercharge our administration['s] ambitious plan to confront the existential threat of climate change.  And it is an existential threat.  ""Climate crisis"", ""existential threat"", ""ambitious plan"". You hear those phrases a lot and you'll notice that they are all suspiciously non-precise. So what do they mean for you? Will they mean higher energy prices? For starters, gas prices are already up, in case you haven't noticed. Electricity will follow. Higher costs hurt the weakest, inflation always does, but it's worse than that. Green energy inevitably means blackouts. Someday that may change as technology progresses, but as of right now and given the current state of technology, green energy means a less reliable power grid. It means failures like the ones we're seeing now in Texas. That's not a talking point, that is true. It's science. So of course, they're denying it. Here's our new climate czar taking a quick break from spewing carbon in his private jet to lecture the rest of us about a topic he personally knows nothing about: Private sector jobs and how more windmills are going to generate tons of them: KERRY'S PRIVATE JET USE SHOWS HOW HARD IT IS TO ACTUALLY CUT EMISSIONS: CLIMATE AUTHOR JOHN KERRY, JAN. 27:  The president of the United States has expressed in every comment he has made about climate the need to grow the new jobs that pay better, that are cleaner than -- I mean, you know, you look at the consequences of black lung for a miner, for instance, and measure that against the fastest growing job in the United States before COVID [which] was solar power technician ... And similarly, you have the second fastest-growing job pre-COVID was wind turbine technician. This is happening. The old plan, you'll remember, was coding. All the guys in pickup trucks were going to learn to code and run the Internet after we sent their jobs to China. In the end, of course, we just imported people from China to code, so that didn't actually happen. But John Kerry has another idea: High school-educated rural people are going to be wind turbine technicians. So what they used to do with transmissions, whatever that was, they're going to do with windmills; put bearings in them or lube them or something. Now, it's possible that John Kerry actually believes that. Maybe he's never been within 20 feet of a wind turbine. He definitely doesn't live near one. They don't have wind farms in Aspen or Martha's Vineyard and they're not getting them. John Kerry himself once fought to keep wind farms out of sight of his summer house on Nantucket. That's hypocritical, but it's not surprising. People who support wind farms, as a rule, live very far from wind farms. People who live near wind farms have a totally different view, and why wouldn't they? How would you like a massive power plant in your backyard humming and buzzing and chopping up birds? That's what a wind turbine is. If you're ever in rural America, go see one for yourself. You'll be shocked by how awful it is once you get up close. Your first thought may be, ""This is supposed to be good for the environment."" Wind farms are one of those ideas you can only support if you don't know too much about them, and maybe that's why there's never been mass popular support for them.  No large group of citizens has ever demanded that some Goldman Sachs company destroy the natural environment with Chinese-made windmills that don't work when it's cold out. Wait, more expensive and much less reliable? Ugly, inefficient and made by people who hate us? And we can kill endangered species? I'd like some of that. In fact, make it a double. No one anywhere has ever said that, but it doesn't matter because green energy is the ultimate inside game. A tiny number of people profit from it due to government subsidies and regulated prices. Everyone else gets a moral lecture about climate change and anyone who complains about any of it gets called a Nazi by Cory Booker. The problem is that demagogues like Cory Booker have no earthly idea what a wind farm is. They don't know how to run a power grid, or anything else, for that matter. They talk, they brag, but they don't build anything, much less fix or maintain it. They can't, they have no skills. If you don't believe that, take a look at what they have done to our cities.  Not a single major American city is prettier or more functional than it was in 1950. The parks that previous generations so lovingly built are filled with vagrants and junkies. The monuments they constructed are covered with spray paint. Public transportation is a disgrace. It's filthy, the streets are dangerous. Are you really surprised that Cory Booker was once the mayor of Newark, N.J.? You shouldn't be. Cory Booker couldn't fix your ice maker, much less understand your wind farm. None of these people can. It's bad enough that they control the sociology department over at your local community college. But the power grid? No way. They can't get within a hundred yards of it.

Kerry: The world has nine years to avoid climate catastrophe,"John Kerry, the White Houses special envoy on climate, warned Friday that the U.S. only has less than a decade left to avoid the worst of a climate catastrophe.  ""Around 2030 is the date at which we have to get the world now on the right path in order to cap the level of warming at that level of 1.5 [degrees celsius],"" he said at a Munich Security Conference.  ""The scientists told us three years ago we had 12 years to avert the worst consequences of climate crisis. We are now three years gone, so we have nine years left,"" Kerry later told CBS News. ""There is no room for B.S. anymore. There's no faking it on this one,"" the climate czar said.  Kerry pointed to this weeks deadly snowstorms across much of the U.S. ""Obviously we want to prevent this from becoming the new normal to the degree that we can,"" he continued.  Kerry noted that the popular belief is that climate change only relates to temperature increases, not decreases, but said in reality it threatens all weather patterns.  JOHN KERRY TOOK A PRIVATE JET TO ICELAND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AWARD ""I think it's a very appropriate way to think of it, so it is directly related to the warming, even though your instinct is to say, wait a minute, this is the new Ice Age. But it's not,"" Kerry said. ""It is coming from global warming and it threatens all the normal weather patterns."" Winter Storm Uri brought ice and snow to swaths of the U.S. that rarely see such low temperatures. States like Texas were caught off guard, and millions were left without power as the electric grid was overwhelmed with the demand for heat. Tuesday was the coldest day in North Texas in 72 years, and the Dallas- Fort Worth area reached a record low of minus two degrees Fahrenheit this week.  The warning from Kerry came as the U.S. formally reentered the Paris Climate Agreement Friday. Still, he stressed that joining the agreement would not be enough.  ""Even if we did everything that we said we were going to do when we signed up in Paris, we would see a rise in the Earth's temperature to somewhere around 3.7 degrees or more, which is catastrophic,"" Kerry said. ""We know that just doing Paris is not enough,"" Kerry said during an event for climate action group America is All In. ""If every country delivered, wed still see a warming planet Earth."" JOHN KERRY EXITS CLIMATE ADVISORY BOARD TO JOIN BIDEN ADMINISTRATION  The Biden administration, determined to reinstate most of the 100 climate regulations former President Trump rolled back, is expected to release a new set of emissions reduction goals before Earth Day this year. The goal of the Biden administration is toget the U.S. to net-zero emissions by 2050. Climate change is widely blamed for both warming and droughts, fires and hurricanes, but scientists are divided on whether such unusual cold snaps are linked to it. Some argue that warming temperatures in the Arctic can push frigid polar air south, leading to colder temperatures in the short term. The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the planet. The link between climate change and the behavior of the polar vortex is not yet clear. Other researchers say climate change will make frigid weather events less likely.   ""Hes not entirely correct,"" Texas State climatologist John Neilsen-Gammon told Fox News. ""In Texas, when we get cold we get it from the Arctic, it doesnt form here, it has to move here. The direct temperature effect [of climate change] on cold weather would make extreme cold weather in Texas milder. But dynamically theres decent evidence that jet stream patterns may be disrupted by climate change and could lead to bigger excursions of the jet to low latitudes and could make cold extremes more severe. Kerry was talking about the dynamical effect.""",19/02/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kerry-wild-weather-9-years-climate-catastrophe
"Biden says US, Canada 'doubled down' on efforts to fight climate change","President Biden hosted his first bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday, where the pair pledged to strengthen their partnership and to address the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and a middle-class economic recovery. Biden said the U.S. and Canada ""doubled down"" on efforts to fight climate change. ""Now that the United States is back in the Paris Agreement, we intend to demonstrate our leadership in order to spur other countries to raise their own ambitions,"" Biden said during the virtual event. ""Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad."" Biden said the U.S. and Canada will launch a high-level climate ambition ministerial to align both countries policies and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. NOT SO FAST: WH DODGES ON WHETHER BIDEN AGREES WITH KERRY NINE-YEAR DEADLINE TO AVERT CLIMATE CATASTROPHE  Trudeau said the top priority for the U.S. and Canada remains keeping people safe and ending the pandemic. The Canadian leader also said he and Biden are on the ""same page when it comes to standing up for the middle class"" and discussed leveraging supply chains and supporting businesses to create good, well-paying jobs to help people get back on their feet.  Biden noted that his first call to a foreign leader as president was made to Trudeau. In his very first days in office, Biden revoked a key cross-border permit that effectively halted construction on the Keystone XL Pipeline, which Trudeau said at the time ""disappointed"" his administration.

ALASKA NO LONGER REQUIRING TRAVELERS TO PRESENT NEGATIVE COVID-19 TEST UPON ARRIVAL Big Diomede is an 11.2-square-mile island that is a part of Russia and Little Diomede is a 2.8-square-mile island that is a part of Alaska. ""These islands are only two-and-a-half miles apart, which means that in the winter when the water freezes, you can walk from the United States to Russia in only 20 minutes,"" Andrew explained. ""To make matters even crazier, Big Diomede Island is 21 hours ahead of Little Diomede Island,"" he continued while he pulled up photos of the two islands. ""Which means that if you were to walk from the United States to Russia, youd literally be walking into the next day. This is why they call Little Diomede island Yesterdayland and Big Diomede Tomorrowland.""

However, people who were looking forward to traveling to Russia on foot will likely be disappointed to know the water between the two islands has not frozen in years due to climate change. WITH PROOF OF COVID-19 VACCINES, ICELAND ALLOWING RESIDENTS TO SKIP QUARANTINE According to an interview conducted by Science Magazine, environmental coordinator Opik Ahkinga at Little Diomede says the Bering Sea hasnt really frozen since 2012. ""We havent seen a good freeze up since 2012. When I say freeze up, I mean there was no open water to be seen around both islands for 2-plus miles,"" Ahkinga told the magazine in 2019. ""[Instead,] we saw areas of open water on both the north and south sides of Big Diomede."" Likewise, a report from National Geographic says the temperature gone up in recent years at both islands.  Ice bridges between the two islands were more common during winter months decades and even centuries ago. Historical records show indigenous groups used these frozen routes to travel between the two islands. For travelers who are intent on exploring the Diomede Islands, a private boat ride is your best bet if you have the appropriate travel visas and permits and can actually find someone who can legally transport you. Military bases are stationed at each island, which is a factor that could add to already difficult travel arrangements.

"Pompeo: Trump administration focused on America First, Biden prioritizes fancy deals on climate change","Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed concern that the Biden administration is prioritizing climate rather than American security Friday night on ""Fox News Primetime."" POMPEO: The most important thing that a president does, that secretary of state does, is set a broad understanding of the way the country looks at the world and the way America looks at the world. We centered this on making sure that we were very focused on securing American freedom, we called it America First. If you trade that. If you trade America First for Climate First then youre prepared to trade lots of things. Things with the Chinese, things with the Europeans, all of which will hurt the American people. All for a lofty goal of some carbon reduction some 20 or 30 years out thats all probably just voluntary and frankly not very likely to actually happen. That presents enormous risk here in the United States.  The central thing that presidents have responsibility to do, and their secretaries of state as well, is make sure you know what your priorities are. Ours was securing freedom here at home and abroad.

"Bjorn Lomborg: Climate change and cancel culture ???ere's how left uses fear to push costly, radical policies","Across the world, politicians are now promising climate policies costing tens of trillions of dollars  money we dont have and resources that are desperately needed elsewhere. Yet, climate campaigners tell us, if we dont spend everything on climate now, nothing else matters, because climate change threatens our very civilization. As President Biden says: climate change is ""an existential threat"". Yes, climate change is a real problem. However, it is typically vastly exaggerated, and the resulting alarmism is exploited to justify the wasteful spending of trillions. TUCKER CARLSON: AMERICA''S BREZHNEV LETS US DREAM OF SOCIALLY DISTANCED HOT DOGS ON JULY 4 Pointing this out will get you canceled. I should know, because I have personally been on the receiving end of this climate alarmism enforcement for years. I was recently scheduled to give a public lecture at Duke University when a group of climate-politicized professors  some who write for the UN Climate Panel  publicly asked Duke to cancel my appearance. One of my presentation points was highlighting the latest full U.N. Climate Panel report that estimates the total cost of climate change. They found that unmitigated climate change in half a century will reduce general welfare equivalent to lowering each persons income by between 0.2 and 2%. Given that the U.N. expects each person on the planet to be much better off  363% as wealthy as today  climate might cause us to only be 356% as rich by then. That is a problem, but certainly not the end of the world. Why dont most people know this? Because stories of catastrophe and human guilt garner more clicks and are better for weaponizing political arguments. Unfortunately, were unlikely to make good decisions if were panicked.  The political forces looking to spend the climate trillions and the academia segment supplying the fear want to scrub the climate debate of anything but the scariest scenarios. They want an unwavering allegiance to vigorous spending on climate policy, no matter its effectiveness. They insist on treating this issue as a moral binary choice instead of a realistic balancing of costs and effectiveness that would allow for our many other challenges to be heard as well. The easiest way to get societies to authorize the spending of tens of trillions we dont have is to scare us. Certainly, the professors at Duke didnt want anyone to hear dissenting facts. They tried to stop the lecture through outright lies, such as claiming that my funding comes from Exxon and the Koch brothers. These claims are categorically untrue. They also declared that I had been deemed scientifically dishonest, although the mock trial that  originated that claim has been completely overturned and annulled because it contained no arguments. More worryingly, they raged about how climate catastrophes are so terrible that we should not allow any more climate debate. Yet, their claims were almost uniformly untrue. They said that ""much of the Australian continent"" had been devoured in climate-induced fire. But we know from satellite measurements, published in Nature, that while the fires near population centers had severe impacts, the total land area burned was 4%  one of the lowest-ever percentages, from an average this century of 6.2% and last century of 10.1%. Four percent is not ""much of the Australian continent."" Such claims are more like rantings from people who have been watching too much alarmist TV. They claimed that ""countless lives"" are being lost to climate-related disasters worldwide. Yet, the International Disaster Database shows that in the 2010s, 18,357 people died each year from climate-related impacts such as floods, droughts, storms, wildfire and extreme temperatures. That is the lowest death count in the past century, a 96% decline since the 1920s, despite a larger global population. And 2020 had an even lower death count at 8,086. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Yet, we can only know this when were allowed to hear facts presented. Thankfully, Duke University didnt cave to their craven arguments (you can watch my talk here), but the attempts to suppress free speech, facts and knowledge continue. The easiest way to get societies to authorize the spending of tens of trillions we dont have is to scare us. The academic and activist faction that sets the threatening tone in the climate conversation want dissent eliminated, leaving themselves the only ones authorized to tell you how scared you should be. To avoid wasting trillions, we should not let them. ",15/03/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-fear-guilt-panic-policies-bjorn-lomborg

DAVID PERDUE: I remember 2011 when President Obama threw $1 trillion at so-called infrastructure investment, I cant find any return from any of that investment. As you heard early on a comment from John Kennedy, only about 15% of this infrastructure bill goes to infrastructure. This is a social engineering bill, and its a climate change bill at its roots. The day of reckoning is coming, Brett. We cant keep raising this deficit the way we have. The reality is, one day soon, were going to find there wont be any lenders out there for this federal debt. So I am still on that bandwagon about weve got to become more responsible. Perdue also criticized Democrats for their rhetoric a Georgia voting law, saying their outcry was insulting and ""all about power."" PERDUE: As a son of a man who integrated one of the first school systems in the state of Georgia, and as someone who has fought for equality in the state for the last 60 years, personally, and as someone who fought for criminal justice reform, opportunity zones, and HBCU funding, I am insulted by the false narrative Democrats are trying to perpetrate here. This bill makes it easier to vote and harder to cheat. It builds integrity in the system for people who are concerned about that in November of last year, and it makes it easier for people to vote in every one of our 159 counties.

MSNBC anchor cites climate change as major reason for migrant surge,"MSNBC anchor Ayman Mohyeldin said Saturday that climate change has played a noticable factor in the overwhelming surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Reporting from Guatemala, Mohyeldin told viewers the deep structural and economic problems in the country are ""compounded"" by both the coronavirus pandemic and climate change. Climate change, he said, is ""making the farmland and agricultural base ... that much harder to sustain the economic needs of a country that has 17 million people."" So, he concluded, thousands are flocking to the U.S. TEXAS GOV. ABBOT WARNS BORDER WOES 'WILL GET WORSE'; POINTS TO 'BIPARTISAN RESPONSE' TO BIDEN ADMIN Mohyeldin expanded on that argument on his Twitter page, citing natural disasters as one of the culprits for the mass migration. Thousands of unaccompanied minors are crowding holding facilities at the border amid a record migrant surge. Border Patrol agents reported encountering 170,000 migrants along tthe Mexican border in March, a 20-year high. TRAGIC TO SEE BIDEN ADMIN 'FLIP SWITCH' AND REVERSE TRUMP POLICIES AT BORDER: MIKE POMPEO Mohyeldin says he ""sees"" and understands why the Biden administration is trying to get more resources to help Guatemalans. But Republican lawmakers have blamed the crisis on President Bidens decision to reverse several Trump administration immigration policies, such as the Remain in Mexico measure, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until it was their turn in U.S. immigration court. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, R., has fumed that the current administration initially denied media access in border facilities. That's because Biden, Jordan alleged, does not ""want the American people to know what's going on.""

Dems' Green New Deal 2.0 'not the way forward' on climate change: Lomborg,"Bjorn Lomborg, president of Copenhagen Consensus, slammed Democrats plans to reintroduce the Green New Deal, stressing that a ""smarter approach"" is needed. The author of ""False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet Hardcover,"" acknowledged on ""Fox &amp; Friends"" on Tuesday that global warming is ""a real problem,"" but argued that the way Democrats try to ""fix"" the issue is by ""throwing lots of money at it and not actually achieving very much."" Lomborg made the comments a few hours before Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., reintroduced the Green New Deal during a news conference. Ocasio-Cortez noted that the two also unveiled legislation more than two years ago and now they are expanding that proposal. Ocasio-Cortez said during the news conference on Tuesday that the plan ""creates a plan for 20 million union jobs in the United States of America"" to rebuild infrastructure, expand access to mass transit, among other things.  She noted that the legislation has 103 House cosponsors.  The broader idea of a Green New Deal, once an idea on the fringe of the party, has picked up mainstream Democratic support -- a sign of the Democratic Partys lurch to the left in recent years. REPUBLICANS SENATORS LINE UP AGAINST BIDEN'S MASSIVE $2T SPENDING BILL: 'FAR CRY' FROM INFRASTRUCTURE In fact, last month when President Biden released his sprawling proposal to rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure, it included pumping money into renewable energy and combating climate change. The $2.25 trillion measure will be funded largely by raising taxes on U.S. corporations. Some Republicans, including Rep. Nancy Mace, have slammed the infrastructure bill as essentially being the Green New Deal. ""As a new member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in Congress, and as the new representative of a district in need of funding for roads, bridges and ports, Im disturbed by the lefts hijacking of the bipartisan issue of infrastructure and their work to morph it into a socialist wish list,"" Mace wrote in a Fox News op-ed. She noted that ""the plan incorporates large swaths of the socialist Green New Deal, which remains firmly planted on the brains and wish lists of socialists in the House and Senate despite both Congress and voters rejecting the bill."" Mace provided some examples, pointing out that nearly 10% of the package ""is dedicated to subsidizing electric vehicles"" and that ""another $100 billion is allocated to building new public schools to make school lunches Greener."" ""If you actually want to fix climate change, this is going to cost many trillions every year,"" Lomborg noted on Tuesday. ""Of course people are not actually going to live up to that, theyre not going to vote for those kinds of guys and it won't solve the problem."" He went on to discuss ""the fundamental problem,"" which he said is that ""as long as renewable energy or green energy in general is more expensive than fossil fuels, you have to ask everyone to do with less."" ""You have to ask them to pay more for their energy. That might work with rich well-meaning Americans, but of course it's not going to work for the Chinese, the Indians, [and] the Africans,"" he continued. ""And so really we need to invest a lot more in research and development into green energy to innovate the price of green energy down below fossil fuel."" Lomborg explained that ""once that happens, everyone will switch, not just rich well-meaning Americans, but also the Chinese, the Indians and the Africans."" He went on to say that when you actually look at the actions of Democrats as it pertains to green energy, ""they are not achieving very much,"" which he attributed to the fact that ""it's really hard to live without good, reliable and cheap energy."" ""This is not the way forward to force people,"" Lomborg said. ""The way forward is innovation as it's always been.""

Obama DOE scientist dissents from Biden climate change ??xistential crisis??narrative,"Former undersecretary for the Department of Energy under President Obama, Steven Koonin is dissenting from the Biden administrations stance on the global ""climate crisis,"" saying the data do not support the ""hysteria."" ""What I realized, is that, although you hear people talking about were going to believe in the science, the science is settled, weve got an existential crisis  when you actually read the science, it doesnt support that kind of hysteria at all,"" he said in an interview with Fox News Thursday. Koonin, a physicist and professor at New York University, said he began extensively researching climate trends in 2014, prompting him to write his latest book Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesnt, and Why It Matters. BIDEN TO RELEASE CLIMATE GOALS TO IMPROVE JOBS AND LOWER POLLUTION The veteran scientist explained that the data in the assessment reports provided by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.S.s National Climate Assessment do not support drastic calls for countering climate change, as outlined in President Bidens latest climate plan. Koonin said that temperatures are rising globally and have risen by roughly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over the last century. But he argued that even as the earth was warming and continues to warm, mankind has been able to make immense advances, expanding food sources and access to electricity. ""Eventually we will probably need to do something about this, but the scope and scale of what the Biden administration proposed for the U.S., I think is just not there in the data,"" he said. Adding, ""Its not there in the science."" ""I prefer to see us take a much more measured and thoughtful approach to doing this,"" Koonin said. Biden announced Thursday he plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, by relying on greener technologies and rethinking U.S. infrastructure. He plans to invest in union jobs and the middle class by expanding job opportunities while advancing ""environmental justice."" But Koonin argues this is not necessarily feasible. BIDEN AVOIDS CONFRONTING CHINA OVER CLIMATE IN EARTH DAY SPEECH WITH WORLD LEADERS ""The ambition to have a high percent of weather-dependent renewables on the electrical grid is something I would question,"" he said. ""The wind doesnt blow all the time, the sun doesnt shine all the time. And youve got to have backup systems for when that happens."" Koonin explained that ensuring backups to the renewable energy providers increases the cost of the energy grids as a whole  something he said will also make the change harder for developing countries to achieve. The NYU professor explained that the fight for clean energy is a ""secondary priority"" in countries throughout Africa and the Middle East. ""40 percent of the worlds population, dont have adequate energy,"" he said, adding that projections show that as underdevelopment nations progress, energy use globally is going to go up by 50 percent come the middle of the century. ""Eighty percent of the worlds energy come from fossil fuels,"" Koonin said, noting to the massive number of jobs created by the fossil fuel industry. ""That's the nub of the problem -- because those developing countries account for half of the emissions now -- whos going to pay the developing countries not to emit?"" he questioned.  Koonin said the U.S. needs to start exploring geoengineering options that could help cool the earth -- a topic he devotes a chapter to in his book. One option is to make the planet more reflective by releasing aerosols into the atmosphere. The second option he thinks the science community needs to better understand, is how to pull carbon dioxide out of the air.  ""I think we need to understand them better,"" Koonin said, adding it would be good to ""have the tool in your arsenal."" See below for an excerpt from Koonins latest book Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesnt, and Why It Matters. Despite headlines like ""Hurricanes are strengthening under human influences,"" and ""Climate change will be an economic disaster"" the science as summarized in UN and US government reports actually says that hurricanes show no detectable sign of human influence and that global warming several times the Paris Agreement ""guardrail"" will have minimal net impact on the US or global economies. Yet the politicians and media invariably invoke ""The Science"" as they proclaim a climate crisis.In fact, there has been far too little serious public discussion about the knowns and unknowns of climate science, since almost everyone gets their climate information at the end of a long game of telephone. It starts with the basic research findings, goes through the government reports and their summaries, and ends up in the media. Unfortunately, there are ample opportunities for misinformation, both unintentional and deliberate, as the science is packaged and simplified for non-experts.",22/04/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-doe-scientist-dissents-from-climate-change-existential-crisis-narrative
CNN plans climate change town hall after staffer reveals plan to sell climate 'fear' in leaked recording,"CNN is set to host a live town hall with senior Biden administration officials this weekend on the topic of climate change, weeks after a network employee told an undercover journalist the network planned to push ""fear"" about the issue. The town hall, moderated by CNN anchor Dana Bash, will focus on ""The Climate Crisis"" and will air on Friday night to mark this year's celebration of Earth Day, the network announced.  The participants include Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, all of whom will be asked about Biden's campaign promise to remake American climate policy.  Earlier this month, right-wing guerilla news outlet Project Veritas published a series of explosive conversations between one of its reporters and a CNN technical director named Charles Chester. In one of the conversations, Chester revealed that following the ""COVID fatigue"" from CNN's coverage of the pandemic, the network will ""start focusing mainly on climate."" CNN STAFFER REVEALS NETWORK'S GOAL WAS TO 'GET TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE' ""Our focus was to get Trump out of office,"" Chester said. ""Without saying it, that's what it was, right? So our next thing is going to be for climate change awareness."" ""Do you think it's going to be just like a lot of like fear for the climate?"" the undercover journalist asked.  ""Yeah. Fear sells,"" Chester responded.  ""Who decides that?"" the journalist asked.  ""The head of the network,"" Chester answered. ""Who's that? Is that Zucker?"" she followed, referring to CNN President Jeff Zucker. ""Zucker, yeah,"" Chester replied.  In another exchange, Chester repeated that climate change is ""going to be the next COVID thing for CNN"" that ""we're going to hone in on."" The network seems to be unabashedly doubling down on their agenda, publishing op-eds with headlines that include ""Finally, the wind is at our back on the climate crisis,"" and ""5 ways businesses can be more aggressive about climate change"" in the days since Chester's comments became public.   ""On his first day in office, Biden took executive actions to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and direct agencies to review and reverse more than 100 Trump actions on the environment,"" a CNN report opens.  Biden on Thursday urged world leaders to act quickly and together to confront the consequences of Earth's changing climate during a U.S.-led virtual climate change summit.",22/04/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-climate-change-town-hall-staffer-climate-fear
"Ingraham: We won the COVID debate, now get ready for 'impending' climate lockdowns","Fox News host Laura Ingraham ripped the Democrats and climate change ""greeniacs"" who ""ignored the human suffering"" of ""draconian"" COVID-19 rules on Wednesday's ""The Ingraham Angle,"" claiming the drop in carbon emissions during lockdowns left activists ""giddy"" and paved way for the exploitation of ""another hyped crisis""--climate change. INGRAHAM: Now, remember, the left believes that America isn't exceptional, it's systemically racist, and that means we shouldn't be any better off than the rest of the world. So the greeniacs saw an opening when the global economy, due to covid, cratered last year. Because of the lockdown's closures and reduced demand. Carbon emissions fell by about 2.6 billion Metric tons, which was a seven percent drop from the year prior. Climate change activists who ignored or dismissed the human suffering caused by these draconian COVID rules were positively giddy  ...  But after some fits and starts, we won the COVID debate. Their so-called public health experts were wrong on everything from lockdowns to masks to social distancing. Those measures inflicted enormous economic, educational and psychological harm to adults and children alike  ...  Yet now we see the usual suspects lining up to exploit another hyped crisis. Of course, I'm talking about climate change, and the end goal is the same. They want more of your money and your freedom. And if they have to take extreme measures to accomplish this, oh, they will, unless we're ready for them. So if we apply the lessons learned in our battle against the COVID lockdowns, I'm confident we can stop them and we can win this.

BIDEN UNVEILS CHINA TASK FORCE AT PENTAGON He made the declaration amid pressure from Republican lawmakers regarding his policy toward Russia in the wake of ransomware attacks that targeted key U.S. infrastructure, including his administrations decision to waive sanctions on the Russia-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The president said he would speak to key European allies about a unified approach to combating climate change, which he has identified as a priority for his administration. ""We must all commit to an ambitious climate action if were going to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius and lead the global transition in clean energy technology,"" Biden said.  The U.S. formally rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement in February following Bidens day-one executive order. The order reversed a Trump-era decision to withdraw from the accord. Biden has suggested that climate change poses a threat to U.S. military security on multiple occasions. In February, he noted that he had directed the Pentagon to reimagine the countrys strategy for dealing with the impact of climate change.

"LIVE UPDATES: G-7 leaders agree to more global funding for climate change, warn China, Russia","The leaders of the G-7 agreed to additional funding to help poorer countries battle climate change, capping the last day of the summit on England's southwest coast on Sunday. The nations also pledged more than 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to poorer nations, endorsed a global minimum tax on multinational corporations and agreed they will work together to challenge Chinas ""non-market economic practices"" and to call on Beijing to respect human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. The climate change commitment is part of a previous pledge of $100 billion a year to cut carbon emissions globally, according to Reuters.  Climate activists have shown up near the Cornwall summit to express their displeasure over the lack of progress on the issue.

Tucker Carlson: Scientists want to use human engineering to solve climate change,"A few days ago, the Wall Street Journal held an event called the ""Tech Health Conference."" During the event, one reporter had a question for the head of Google's ""Health Division,"" a man called David Feinberg.   Why, the reporter asked, was Google censoring searches for information about the possibility that COVID had escaped from a laboratory in China? Feinberg began by admitting the premise of the question. Yes, Google was in fact hiding information from its users, he effectively conceded. But it was for their own good. According to Feinberg, Google didn't want to, ""lead people down pathways that we would find to be not authoritative information.""  Authoritative information. Youve heard that phrase a lot in the last year, and phrases like it. ""Authoritative information"" is the opposite of ""misinformation""  or worse, a ""conspiracy theory.""   Its really important. All youre allowed to see is authoritative information. So its worth knowing in this and many other cases, what is it? And where exactly did Google get its so-called ""authoritative information."" In this case, it came from a group led by a noted man of science called Peter Daszak. If the name sounds familiar, Peter Daszak is the person who almost single-handedly stopped virtually all public speculation about the lab leak early in the pandemic. Daszak did this in one swoop by organizing a letter to The Lancet -- one of the top scientific publications -- stating as fact that there was no possibility the coronavirus could have come from the lab in Wuhan. No chance. Many people believed him and they stopped looking. It was in The Lancet, after all. Almost no one asked why Peter Daszak might be saying this.   DASZAK RECUSED FROM LANCET'S COVID-19 COMMISSION We now know the answer: Peter Daszak himself was funding research on bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, using U.S. taxpayer dollars, supplied by Tony Fauci. According to one grant Fauci approved, Daszak was authorized to conduct quote, ""virus infection experiments across a range of cell cultures from different species and humanized mice.""   Why humanized mice? Well, because they mimic humans. Daszak and his collaborators wanted to make viruses more infectious to people. He didn't hide this. In December 2019, Daszak appeared on a podcast on YouTube -- which is owned by Google -- to brag about how easy it is to manipulate bat coronaviruses.  PETER DASZAK: Coronavirus is a pretty good - I mean youre a virologist, you know this stuff. You can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily. Its spike protein, spike protein drives a lot of what happens with the coronavirus, zoonotic risk. So you can get the sequence, build the protein. And we worked with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this. Insert into a backbone of another virus and then do some work in the lab. So really, in one of the great head-hitting in recent history, we learn that the guy directly tied to bat virus experiments in the lab in Wuhan was the same guy telling the entire world that there was no possibility this virus could have come from the Wuhan lab. Conflict of interest, anyone? Its absurd. Its beyond belief. Whats amazing is Google knew it. The evidence was right there on one of its platforms  YouTube, which it owns.   GOOGLE'S REPORTED TIES TO WUHAN LINKED SCIENTIST POINTS TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS OF OUR TIME: HILTON So why did Google continue to rely on Peter Daszak, of all people on earth, to decide what the world could know about the origins of COVID? Thats the question. Tonight, we know why. It turns out Tony Fauci wasn't the only one funding Peter Daszak's research on bat viruses. Google was funding that research, too. It sounds unlikely, but we know it.  We know this from a new piece in the National Pulse, which just published the evidence. Heres the evidence: Peter Daszak admitted it in print. We dont need to speculate, its right there. Beginning in 2010, several of Daszak's research papers explicitly acknowledge that they were funded by Google. One of those papers was an observational study that analyzed the transmission of viruses from bats to humans in Bangladesh.   ""Proximity of bats to human populations may facilitate the transmission of viruses either through direct contact or through food-borne routes.""  A decade later, Google paid for Peter Daszak to take his studies of bat viruses to Guangdong Province, China, home of the now-famous bat caves. While there, Daszak used Google's money to study the quote, ""perceptions associated with transmission of pathogens with pandemic potential in highly exposed human populations at the animal-human interface.""   So, yes, Peter Daszak knows an awful lot about bat-borne pandemics. It seems likely he is implicated in one. Google is likely implicated in it as well. Together, Google and Daszak worked to keep critical factual information from the public, as nearly four million people around the world died from the virus. Its a horrible story, and someday, perhaps soon, well learn all of it. But in the meantime, as we await the indictments we fervently hope are coming, the whole ugly story makes you wonder bigger things. For example, how many other dangerous, potentially world-altering experiments are going on right now, in this and other counties, funded by the secretive daisy-chain of government health agencies, and powerful NGOs? Experiments youve never heard of but that could change your life forever? If they can engineer bat viruses to make them more infectious, and oops, they escaped from a lab, what else are they doing? Youre not supposed to ask of course. Youve been commanded to ""trust the science,"" and get back to watching Netflix. Only a Neanderthal asks questions. Thats been the arrangement in science for quite a while now. You pay for it, we do it, its all good. But why should that continue? Now that we know liars and moral pygmies  people like Tony Fauci, and the soulless bots at Google HQ  and running global science, maybe its worth being slightly more inquisitive about whats happening in labs around the world. Why not? It could affect us.   INGRAHAM: THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND RED STATE GOVS, NOT BIDN, FAUCI, LED US OUT OF COVID LOCKDOWN GLOOM For example, take a look at this tape. Its from an annual conference called the ""World Science Festival."" A few years ago, the conference featured a professor of bioethics and philosophy at New York University named Mathew Liao.   Liao is among the most influential bioethicists in the world  a fact that will amaze you. Liao explained that climate change can be solved with something called ""human engineering.""  MATTHEW LIAO: My view is that what we need is a really robust ethical framework and within this ethical robust framework I think theres a way going forward where we can do this ethically. But theres actually a lot of opportunities for this to solve big world problems, one thing is climate change. Climate change is a really big problem we dont really know how to solve it but it turns out we can use human engineering to help us address climate change. Heres a tip: anyone who uses the phrase ""robust ethical framework"" wouldnt know ethics if they got in the shower with them. And you know that for a fact because he uses the phrase ""human engineering."" SEN. BLACKBURN SLAMS FAUCI OVER COVID-19 LAB LEAK THEORY DISMISSAL, SAYS HE SHEILDED CHINA FROM SCRUTINY Human engineering? The name alone should make you pause. People arent bridge improvements. You cant just add rebar, pour a few yards of concrete, and improve the human condition, much less the human soul. People are living beings. Theyre alive. They cant be engineered. Liao the eminent bioethicist seems unaware of this. He outlined some of his proposals in a recent paper in the Journal of ""Ethics, Policy &amp; Environment."" In that paper, Liao suggests a solution to the problem, the pressing problem, of people eating hamburgers. People like hamburgers, it turns out. How can we get people to stop eating hamburgers? Not by convincing them that hamburgers are bad. That was the old way. Thats how democracy worked. You would tell people something, if they believed they did it, if they didnt believe you, they didnt. But it turns out thats too time-consuming. The new model is we just use pharmaceuticals. Your kids are getting uppity? Dope them out, and theyll obey.  Liao proposes a nationwide system like that, a pill that would make people nauseous at the sight of red meat. Given that climate change is an ""existential threat,"" thats limiting our time on earth to 20 years, or 12 years, or 6 months, or pick your exaggeration, its hard to imagine a pill like that would soon become mandatory. Sound like a dystopian fantasy? Its not. Liao is deadly serious. He said so at the ""World Science Festival.""   MATTHEW LIAO: So heres a thought, we have this intolerance for example I have milk intolerance, some people on intolerant to fish so possibly we can use human engineering to make it the case where we are intolerant to certain types of meat, certain types of bovine proteins, so thats something we can do through human engineering, possibly address really big world problems through human engineering.   Again, says the bioethicist, ""human engineering"" is the answer. But wait a second, you ask. Human engineering? Thats kind of creepy. Didnt we decide this kind of thing in Europe 80 years ago, and at the time, didnt we agree were not going to do that ever again? True. But bioethicists have short memories apparently. And in any case, climate change is a pressing emergency. We dont have time to consider the consequences of our response to this existential crisis.   CHINESE STATE MEDIA PANNED FOR PUSHING FOR WUHAN LAB TO RECEIVE NOBEL PRIZE So heres an idea, said Liao at the World Science Festival: lets fiddle with the human genome to see if we can make human children smaller than they are now. A race of dwarfs. Theyd eat less, and be cheaper to transport. And that would reduce greenhouse gasses.  MATTHEW LIAO: So it turns out the larger you are, think of the lifetime of greenhouse gas emissions that are required, the energy thats required to transport larger people rather than smaller people right. But if we are smaller just by 15cm, I did the math that about mass reduction of 25%, which is huge. And 100 years ago were all on average smaller, exactly about 15 cm smaller. So think of the lifetime greenhouse gas emissions if we had smaller children. So thats something we can do. Imagine if we had smaller children. Little tiny children. Think of how little they would emit in greenhouse gasses. Think about how easy it would be to pick them up, juggle them around, control them. All we need to do is experiment on human children. And we can solve climate change. That was at a public conference five years ago. Nobody said anything. Thats where we are. Surprised? You shouldnt be. In fact, its less ghoulish than some of the things happening in labs right now. This is what science looks like when it's been completely decoupled from wisdom, decency and Christianity. Its a science fiction novel come to life, except its real. In fact, Google might be funding it right now.

NASA studies Louisiana delta system in effort to combat global climate change,"Erosion, sinking land and sea rise from climate change have killed the Louisiana woods where a 41-year-old Native American chief played as a child. Not far away in the Mississippi River delta system, middle-school students can stand on islands that emerged the year they were born. NASA is using high-tech airborne systems along with boats and mud-slogging work on islands for a $15 million, five-year study of these adjacent areas of Louisiana. One is hitched to a river and growing; the other is disconnected and dying. Scientists from NASA and a half-dozen universities from Boston to California aim to create computer models that can be used with satellite data to let countries around the world learn which parts of their dwindling deltas can be shored up and which are past hope. NASA ADMINISTRATOR BILL NELSON BELIEVES WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE ""If you have to choose between saving an area and losing another instead of losing everything, you want to know where to put your resources to work to save the livelihood of all the people who live there,"" said lead scientist Marc Simard of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. While oceans rise because of climate change, the world's river deltas  home to seafood nurseries and more than 300 million people -- are sinking and shrinking. To figure out where to shore up dying deltas, NASA is studying water flowing in and out of Louisiana's Atchafalaya and Terrebonne basins, sediment carried by it, and plants that can slow the flow, trap sediment and pull carbon from the air. Louisiana holds 40% of the nations wetlands, but theyre disappearing fast -- about 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of the state have been lost since the 1930s. Thats about 80% of the nations wetland losses, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Using two kinds of radar and a spectrometer that measures more colors than the human eye can distinguish, high-altitude NASA airplanes have been collecting information such as water height, slope, sediment, and the types and density of plants. Some measurements are as precise as a couple of centimeters (less than an inch). On boats and islands, scientists and students from across the country take samples and measure everything from currents to diameters of trees. Their findings will be used to calibrate the airborne instruments. ""Ive been working here 15 years, and one of the toughest parts about working in a delta is you can only touch one little piece of it at any one time and understand one little piece of it at one time,"" said Robert Twilley, a professor of oceanography and coastal sciences at Louisiana State University. ""Now we have the capability of working with NASA to understand the entire delta."" The Mississippi River drains 41% of the continental United States, collecting 150 million tons (130 million metric tons) of sediment per year. But, largely because of flood-prevention levees, most sediment shoots into the Gulf of Mexico rather than settling in wetlands. ""Deltas are the babies of the geological timescale. They are very young and fragile, in a delicate balance of sinking and growing,"" NASA states on the Delta-X project website. In geological time, young means thousands of years. On that scale, Louisiana's Wax Lake Delta is taking its first breaths. It dates to 1942, when the Army Corps of Engineers dug an outlet from the lake to reduce flood threats to Morgan City, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Sediment from the Atchafalaya River filled the lake, then began creating islands in the Gulf. The new islands are thick with black willows and, in spring, thigh-high butterweed topped with small yellow flowers. Older wetlands in areas surveyed by Delta-X aircraft are more diverse, their soil rich with humus from generations of plants. Along nearby Hog Bayou, blue buntings and scarlet tanagers dart through magnolia branches and skinks skitter up trees. In swamps, ospreys nest atop bald cypresses and alligators float in the water below. In addition to working at LSU, Twilley has spent about nine years as executive director of Louisiana Sea Grant College Program, which uses the Wax Lake Delta as a classroom for middle- and high-school students. ""We take kids and make them stand on land that was formed the year they were born."" Twilley said. In contrast, the adjacent Terrebonne Basin is shrinking so rapidly that the government is paying to move the Isle de Jean Charles band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians from a vanishing island to higher ground. That band isn't the only Native American group losing ground. ""The wooded areas we used to run through as children -- theyre dead,"" said Chief Shirell Parfait-Dardar of the Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha Indians, based less than 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the Wax Lake Delta. ""Ghost forests"" are common in degrading deltas where salt water intrudes as land sinks and erodes, LSU's Twilley said. Louisiana is considering two projects that would divert Atchafalaya River sediment to build land in the Terrebonne Basin, but a decision is more than a year away, according to the state Coastal Restoration and Preservation Authority. Delta-X's study gets downright granular. A California Institute of Technology team that studies how sediment moves and is deposited on Earth and other planets will analyze the amounts of sediment in high- and low-tide water samples, breaking the particles down into about 100 sizes. One way LSU researchers measure how much land has been formed by sediment involves sprinkling white feldspar dust on the ground. They return to see how deeply it's buried by new sediment. They do that by injecting liquid nitrogen into hollow tubes to freeze the dirt and muck around them. When the tubes are pulled up, the frozen ""popsicles"" show a white ring. They measure from there to the top. In the Terrebonne Basin, such sedimentation can't keep up with subsidence and sea level rise. ""Thus the wetlands basically drown,"" Twilley said. Planes and boats went out in March and April and will go out again in fall for a second set of measurements. And two international satellites are scheduled for launch next year, each carrying one of the two kinds of radar used over Louisiana. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP   To gauge how plants affect water movement, long-wavelengths of L-band radar can measure water level changes in open and vegetated channels, NASA's Simard said. And high-frequency Ka-band radar can measure surface height of open water, showing how it slopes -- and where its moving. ""All of the tools theyre bringing to bear is really impressive,"" said Indiana University sedimentary geologist Douglas Edmonds, who is not part of the project but has worked with many of the researchers.

Granholm on Miami condo collapse: 'We don't know' if climate change was cause,"Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm implied that climate change could have been a cause of the tragic residential building collapse in Surfside, Fla., last week. Granholm was asked if climate change could have played a role in the building's collapse during a CNN interview on Tuesday. MIAMI CONDO BUILDING COLLAPSE: UCONN PITCHER RECALLS HARROWING INCIDENT, HELPING ELDERLY WOMAN GET OUT ""Obviously, we dont know fully, but we do know that the seas are rising. We know that were losing inches and inches of beaches, not just in Florida but all around,"" Granholm said. ""Michigan, where Im from, weve seen the loss of beaches because the waters are rising, so this is a phenomenon that will continue.""  Granholm used the deadly building collapse, which left at least 11 people dead and 150 unaccounted for, to push for President Biden's infrastructure package. ""Well have to wait to see what the analysis is for this building, but the issue about resiliency and making sure we adapt to this changing climate, thats going to mean levees need to be built, sea walls need to be built, infrastructure needs to be built,"" she said. ""There's so much investment that we need to do protect ourselves from climate change but also to address it and mitigate it,"" Granholm continued. ""Hopefully these infrastructure bills, when taken together, will make a huge step and allow America to lead again."" Biden and first lady Jill Biden will travel to Surfside on Thursday to visit with the families of victims of the collapsed Miami-area condominium tower, the White House said. ENERGY SECRETARY GRANHOLM DIVESTS FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLE COMPANY: REPORTS Biden has offered federal help and extended his concerns to the community as people ""grieve their lost loved ones and wait anxiously as search and rescue efforts continue,"" as he said in one tweet. ""They want to thank the heroic first responders, search and rescue teams, and everyone who has been working tirelessly around the clock and meet with the families who have been forced to endure this terrible tragedy waiting in anguish and heartbreak for word of their loved ones,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.  The slow work of sifting through the remnants of the collapsed building stretched into a sixth day Tuesday. Two additional bodies were found Monday, raising the count of confirmed dead to 11. That leaves 150 people still unaccounted for in the community of Surfside. No one has been found alive since hours after the collapse Thursday.

"Outrage after CNN, Granholm suggest climate change could have role in Surfside building collapse: 'Ghoulish'","CNN and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm were ripped by viewers on Tuesday for suggesting that climate change could have been a factor in the tragic building collapse in Surfside, Florida.  At least 11 people were killed and over 150 are missing in the aftermath of the collapse of the Surfside beachfront condo. Recent reports have revealed there were warning signs before the building fell as engineers reported several issues with the structure, but a local building official told board members that the building was in ""very good shape."" Despite the new intel, CNN asked Granholm what role a changing climate could have had on the destruction. ""Given what we know about the changing climate, given that you've seen an increase in so called extraordinary tides, and the impact that that can have in areas like south Florida, do you think that climate would have played a role in that building's collapse?"" anchor Erica Hill asked. The segment was accompanied by the chyron, ""Could Climate Crisis Have Contributed to Building Collapse?"" ""Well, obviously we don't know fully,"" Granholm replied. ""We know that we're losing inches and inches of beach  not just in Florida, but all around,"" Granholm said. The secretary said she needed to wait to see the analysis of the current investigation into the building collapse, but said that we should ""adapt"" to and ""protect ourselves"" from the consequences of a changing climate. One possible solution, she suggested, was to pass President Biden's infrastructure bills. MSNBC'S JOSHUA JOHNSON SUGGESTS SURFSIDE CONDO COLLAPSE CAN JUSTIFY PRICE TAG OF INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING Viewers fumed that CNN and their guest appeared to be using the Surfside tragedy for political purposes. ""Absolutely ghoulish"" and ""beyond parody"" other critics responded.  Other media have been accused of playing politics and playing the blame game in the aftermath of the Florida tragedy. The Intercept, for instance, appeared to pin the horror on the shoulders of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis over the weekend with a suggestive tweet that juxtaposed what he wrote about deregulation in January 2019 with a CNN headline about last week's disaster.  ""These two things obviously have zero to do with each other, but people like Ken cant help but try to ghoulishly seize on every tragedy to try to score point on political opponents,"" conservative writer AG Hamilton said.",29/06/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-biden-energy-secretary-climate-change-surfside-building-collapse
Democratic Rep. Defazio: Pass House infrastructure bill because . . . climate change,"Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., called on House lawmakers to pass a massive surface transportation bill on Wednesday, arguing the legislation was necessary to overhaul the countrys highways due to the impacts of climate change. DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, pointed to an ongoing heatwave that has damaged infrastructure in the Pacific Northwest as an example of why his plan should be approved. Democrats have argued the infrastructure projects also would result in job creation. ""We had pavement melting, cables supplying the streetcars melting this past week,"" DeFazio added. ""Pretty extraordinary, unprecedented, so we have to rebuild in ways that we never even thought about before. It is going to be expensive, but the good news is that its going to create millions, millions of good-paying jobs."" DeFazio spoke at a press conference ahead of an expected vote on the $547 billion bill. The Democratic lawmaker likened the proposal to the development of the interstate highway system under former President Dwight Eisenhower in the early days of the Cold War. ""It was built as the national defense highway system because of fears of invasion by Russia, to move military equipment, and because of fear of nuclear war, to evacuate the cities. We have a new existential challenge, which is climate change,"" DeFazio said. ""As we move into the 21st century and we rebuild our infrastructure, this is time to transform the way the system works and rebuild it with materials that are resilient, rebuild it in anticipation of sea-level rise, severe weather events, heatwaves in the Northwest."" Dubbed the ""Invest in America Act,"" the bill introduced by DeFazio would allocate $343 billion toward road, bridge and safety-related projects, with an emphasis on reducing carbon emissions. The sum includes $6.2 billion toward ""mitigation and resiliency improvements"" to existing transportation systems.  House lawmakers began debate on the bill on Wednesday and are expected to vote this week. President Biden has called for the inclusion of climate-friendly policies amid ongoing negotiations for a comprehensive spending package on infrastructure and other projects.",30/06/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rep-climate-change-fear-nuclear-war-invasion-house-infrastructure-bill
"DeSantis: 'No evidence' climate change played role in condo collapse, despite energy secretary's claim","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told Fox News on Wednesday that global warming does not appear to have had an impact on the tragic condominium collapse in Surfside in Miami-Dade County, Fla. last week. At least 147 people remain missing with 16 confirmed dead from the collapse. DeSantis told ""The Story"" he wants an investigation into what truly caused the tragedy. On Tuesday, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm suggested during a TV interview that global warming and ocean water levels could have played a part in the destruction at Champlain Towers South, located along the famous beachfront strip, A1A. ""Obviously, we dont know fully, but we do know that the seas are rising. We know that were losing inches and inches of beaches, not just in Florida but all around,"" the former Michigan Democratic governor said. FAR-LEFT MEDIA WATCHDOG SHIELDS GRANHOLM FROM CONFLICT OF INTEREST REPORTAGE, BUT PAID HER A RETAINER Granholm then transitioned her remarks into a pitch for President Biden's massive multi-trillion infrastructure plan as an apparent preventative measure against future collapses: ""Well have to wait to see what the analysis is for this building, but the issue about resiliency and making sure we adapt to this changing climate,"" she said. ""Hopefully these infrastructure bills ... will make [for] a huge step and allow America to lead again."" DeSantis pushed back on Granholm on Wednesday, remarking that while the recovery effort is foremost at this time, a study must be done to see if the cause of the collapse has implications for other Florida properties.  ""What we're not going to do is use this to advance any pre-existing agenda. There's no agenda here,"" he said. ""We want the facts, we want the truth and we want to know what needs to be done to protect other folks that may be living in other types of building."" DeSantis noted that his state has some of the strictest building codes in the country, given the annual battering it receives from tropical cyclones like that of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. That historic Category-5 storm still stands as the most destructive hurricane to hit Florida and wreaked havoc only a short distance southward in Homestead; causing billions of dollars in damage in Miami-Dade.",30/06/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/media/desantis-no-evidence-climate-change-played-role-in-condo-collapse-despite-energy-secretarys-claim
CNN guests claim climate change is 'larger than the Holocaust',"The latest episode of CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" included a guest, who claimed that the burning of fossil fuels kills ten million people a year and compared it to being ""on the scale of the Holocaust."" On Sunday, CNN anchor Brian Stelter brought on two climate reporters, New York Magazine editor-at-large David Wallace-Wells and writer of the ""Heated"" newsletter Emily Atkin to discuss how the ne news is covering climate change. Stelter opened his segment by bemoaning how journalists are running out of ways to stress the effects from climate change. ""Meteorologists and reporters are running out of words,"" Stelter explained. ""They are running out of words to describe the impacts of climate change. Unprecedented just doesn't cut it anymore."" He asked his guests how the news should ""cover a permanent emergency?"" Wallace-Wells acknowledged that media must remain in ""a state of alarmism"" in reporting the impact of climate disasters.  ""We can't shy away from scary projections about the future or the scary facts as we're living them today,"" Wallace-Wells said. ""I think we also need to start thinking a little harder, be a little clearer in our story-telling, that learning to live in this new future, which will continue to get worseprobably considerably worse from hereis not just going to require decarbonizing, although that's very hard."" OUTRAGE AFTER CNN, GRANHOL SUGGEST CLIMATE CHANGE COULD HAVE ROLE IN SURFSIDE BUILDING COLLAPSE: GHOULISH He went so far as to compare the current climate issues with the Holocaust in terms of deaths. Wallace-Wells explained that estimates ""suggest the burning of fossil fuels kills about 10 million people every year, which is dying on the scale of the Holocaustin fact, larger than the Holocaustevery single year. And yet we don't see many public health stories, we don't see many moral crises stories addressed to that issue."" This number came from a Science Direct study that suggested pollution from fossil fuels caused ten million global excess deaths in 2012. A further Harvard study eventually decreased that number to approximately eight million people per year in 2018. Energy expert Alex Epstein, however, had previously debunked this study, stating that the findings wildly overstated fossil fuel side-effects while underplaying benefits.  ""Since 1980, India's fossil fuel use has increased by 700% and China's has increased by 600%. Did this lead to many more premature deaths given fossil fuels cause 1 in 5 deaths? No, India's life expectancy increased by almost 16 years and China's increased by almost 10,"" Epstein wrote. ""Any study about fossil fuels' side-effects must prominently mention their life-extending benefits. But modern studies, funded by governments with anti-fossil fuel agendas, systematically ignore fossil fuels' benefits and wildly overstate side-effects,"" Epstein continued.   Nevertheless, Atkin was also insistent on wildly overstating the threat of climate change as well as blaming fossil fuels for the damage. ""Yeah, it's not an excuse that you need to talk to a climate scientist anymore to include something in your story that says this extreme heat event was made more likely by climate change, and it's a part of our climate change future,"" Atkin stated. ""And what I would also argue is that you should probably have a sentence in there saying climate change is caused by fossil fuels because climate change is not something that's happening to usit's something that's being done to us."" In the past, experts, reporters, and politicians predicted environmental doomsday for humans with all the predictions turning out wrong. A New York Times article from 1995 falsely warned ""[a]t the most likely rate of rise, some experts say, most of the beaches on the East Coast of the United States would be gone in 25 years.""",06/07/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-guests-claim-climate-change-is-larger-than-the-holocaust

""Climate and weather coverage are completely linked,"" chief content officer Nora Zimmett told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week. ""Its the most important topic of not just our generation, but generations to come. We have a front seat."" While the Atlanta-based Weather Channel has covered climate change on its airwaves, Zimmett said, it hadn't yet done it on a regular basis. Now, she said, there will be a ""full-scale assault"" on the topic. CNN GUESTS CLAIM CLIMATE CHANGE IS LARGER THAN THE HOLOCAUST ""We intend to do that now,"" she said. ""American sentiment only recently caught up with the urgency of the issue. Years ago, our audience didnt want to hear about it. They are much more interested in it now."" Polling shows younger Americans like millennials and Generation Z are more likely to have concerns about climate change. Zimmett, who came to The Weather Channel in 2014 after a two-year stint at CNN, said the evidence of climate change was ""overwhelming,"" and more people were seeing it affect their lives, whether through the recent heatwave in the Pacific Northwest or natural disasters.  She said coverage would focus on ""positive solutions"" for viewers to address mitigating climate change, saying sensationalistic coverage of the issue was the wrong approach. She said she didn't want to ""alienate"" viewers who are skeptical on the issue, as scientists and Americans debate how much of a role humans play in warming global temperatures.

Left to warn Biden that being tough on Chinese human rights could harm global warming effort,"A  progressive-led letter is expected to hit President Bidens desk Thursday attempting to temper the administrations confrontational approach when it comes to China, for the sake of climate change. Tensions between the U.S. and China reached heightened levels under Donald Trump, but the Biden administration has done little to mollify relations. OBAMA DOE SCIENTIST DISSENTS FROM BIDEN CLIMATE CHANGE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS NARRATIVE A group of more than 40 progressive organizations fear that issues like an increasingly hardline approach to the Uyghur genocide and human rights abuses in Hong Kong could jeopardize another big-ticket item for the Biden presidency  ending climate change, first reported Politico. In a letter obtained by the Washington, D.C.-based outlet, the organizations are calling on Biden and Congress ""to eschew the dominant antagonistic approach to U.S.-China relations and instead prioritize multilateralism, diplomacy, and cooperation with China to address the existential threat that is the climate crisis."" ""Nothing less than the future of our planet depends on ending the new Cold War between the United States and China,"" the letter continues. ""To combat the climate crisis and build a global economy that works for everyday working people  in the U.S. and China alike  we must shift from competition to cooperation."" The letter from groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists reflects a division within the Democratic Party. Moderate Democratic members of Congress have pushed the administration to be tough on China and reject human rights abuses while addressing climate change at home.  But the partys more leftist members argue addressing climate change in the U.S. is not enough. EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE TRAPPING 'UNPRECEDENTED' AMOUNT OF HEAT: NASA, NOAA REPORT Biden has said the chilly U.S.-China relationship is ultimately a ""battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies,"" suggesting the president may be unwilling to back off hardline policies and sanctions placed on China. Even as the president pushes the U.S. to embrace climate-friendly initiatives, materials imported from China for the construction of solar panels were banned last month over allegations of forced labor.  And special presidential climate envoy John Kerry has made it clear the U.S. will consider pushing China on climate-based policies with or without its cooperation.  Kerry said the U.S. was ""examining"" how carbon taxes could work if China failed to make progress on lowering its greenhouse gas emissions.    ""Our preference would be that every country is joining in in a fair manner in its efforts to reduce emissions sufficiently, that were all paying the price of avoiding the consequences of the global climate crisis,"" Kerry told reporters in May.

"California, Florida fish mortality pinned to drought, climate change","California officials warned this week that salmon in the state's Sacramento River might not survive the region's historic drought.  The California Department of Fish and Wildlife said that ""nearly all"" of the endangered winter-run Chinook salmon's juveniles might not make it through the season, according to The Sacramento Bee. WESTERN FARMERS FIGHT FOR FAIRNESS, BUSINESS AMID DROUGHT 'LIKE HURRICANE KATRINA' The publication reported Wednesday that a final blow, after two years of ""severe mortality during the last drought,"" would risk the extinction of the species  even though the agency has hauled millions of the Chinook salmon to Bay Area waters as a precaution. Triple-digit temperatures have plagued the West, killing hundreds of people in the last major heat wave. The severe conditions have exacerbated the climate-driven ""megadrought,"" leading to less water and less streamflow. ""We were talking about [drought response] in January, hoping weather conditions would improve, but developing a game plan in case they didnt,"" Brett Galyean, project leader for Coleman and Livingston Stone national fish hatcheries, said in a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Pacific Southwest Region news release earlier this month. ""We were able to release about 11.8 million fall-run Chinook salmon before river conditions turned poor because we planned ahead and used the tools in our toolbox."" Using special trucks, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife relocated almost 17 million fall-run Chinook salmon earlier this year because of dry conditions. Residents near California's lower Klamath River have witnessed the change in their ecosystems firsthand.  As toxic algal blooms in the Klamath basin's main lank threaten the also-endangered suckerfish a month earlier than ""normal,"" water is in short supply and dead juvenile chinook salmon are found every day. In addition, extra flows of water from Upper Klamath Lake that mitigate outbreaks of a parasitic disease that proliferates when the river is low are not coming this year and the parasite is killing thousands of juvenile salmon. THOUSANDS OF FISH DROPPED FROM PLANE TO RESTOCK HIGH-ELEVATION LAKES IN UTAH Sixty-three percent of fish caught in research traps near the rivers mouth have been found dead.  ""When I first started this job 23 years ago, extinction was never a part of the conversation,"" Jamie Holt, lead fisheries technician for the Yurok Tribe, said of the salmon earlier this month. ""If we have another year like were seeing now, extinction is what were talking about."" Yet issues for the United States' fish are bicoastal, as the effects of climate change continue to grip the nation.  In Florida's Tampa Bay and elsewhere, fish kills from red tide  and the resulting smell and potential respiratory irritation  have prompted officials to call for government aid. NPR reported Tuesday that the Pinellas County solid waste division said around 600 tons of dead sea life have been collected throughout the county since late June. ""Red tide is destroying ecosystems in the Tampa Bay Area,"" Floridas Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried told The Orlando Sentinel on Monday. ""Our water quality must come before politics."" While the massive fish kills are nothing new and algal blooms are natural, NPR noted that blooms are rarely seen in the summer and the Tampa Bay area.  Warmer waters, a change in salinity, more carbon dioxide, changes in rainfall and sea level rise all help to provide a hospitable environment for the blooms, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The reason for the fish kills is under debate  though Tropical Storm Elsa recently lashed Florida shores. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Scientists are looking into whether rapidly spreading red tide blooms are connected to the state's decision to pump 215 million gallons of polluted wastewater into Tampa Bay last spring.

""This bill is absolutely a progressive victory,"" she said, according to NY1 in New York City. ""If it wasn't for progressives in the House, we probably would be stuck with that tiny, pathetic bipartisan bill alone."" Democrats plan to pass the bill using reconciliation, meaning they wont need Republican votes and can bypass a potential filibuster, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only four Democratic votes, according to Bloomberg.

Coe says climate change could affect sports calendars,"The effects of climate change will force sports bodies to rethink their calendar of events, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said Sunday.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM ""You dont have to be a devotee of climate change or a denier to know the world is getting hotter,"" Coe said. ""It probably will mean a global discussion around the calendar and how we stage events."" In 2019, the mens womens marathons and race walks were moved from Tokyo to Sapporo in the hopes the northern city would have cooler temperatures. Sapporo, however, was also hot and Saturdays womens marathon was moved up one hour to 6 a.m. on the eve of the event. Tennis and womens soccer were also switched from morning start times under pressure from players concerned for their health. Coe noted the stress on his staff of ""having to create field hospitals and having your team spending a year thinking about little else other than how you are going to be coping with the welfare of the athletes."" ""Nobody wants to do that. Thats not what we came into the sport for,"" he said, adding ""we could well be confronting the same temperatures in Paris in 2024.""

5 things to know about the new UN report on climate change,"The U.N.-appointed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a new report Monday summarizing the latest authoritative scientific information about global warming. Here are five important takeaways. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM SAYS THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC HAS WORSENED HUNGER AROUND THE WORLD BLAMING HUMANS The report says almost all of the warming that has occurred since pre-industrial times was caused by the release of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Much of that is the result of humans burning fossil fuels  coal, oil, wood and natural gas. The authors say global temperatures have already risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 19th century, reaching their highest in over 100,000 years, and only a fraction of that increase can have come from natural forces. ___ PARIS GOALS Almost all countries have signed up to the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to limit global warming to an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average by the year 2100. The agreements says that ideally the increase would be no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). But the report's 200-plus authors looked at five scenarios and concluded that all will see the world cross the 1.5-degree threshold in the 2030s  sooner than in previous predictions. Three of those scenarios will also see temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius. CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVISTS THREATEN TO CAMP OUTSIDE DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S OFFICE UNTIL THEIR DEMANDS ARE MET  ___ DIRE CONSEQUENCES The 3,000-plus-page report concludes that ice melt and sea level rise are already accelerating. Wild weather events  from storms to heat waves  are also expected to worsen and become more frequent. Further warming is ""locked in"" due to the greenhouse gases humans have already released into the atmosphere. That means even if emissions are drastically cut, some changes will be ""irreversible"" for centuries, the report said. ___ SOME HOPE While many of the reports predictions paint a grim picture of humans' impact on the planet and the consequences that will have going forward, the IPCC also found that so-called tipping points, like catastrophic ice sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents, are ""low likelihood,"" though they cannot be ruled out. COE SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE COULD AFFECT SPORTS CALENDARS ___ BIG CATCH  Although temperatures are expected to overshoot the 1.5-degree-Celsius target in the next decade, the report suggests that warming could be brought back down to this level through what are known as ""negative emissions."" That means sucking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than is added, effectively cooling the planet again.

Greg Gutfeld: Climate change is saving hundreds of thousands of lives,"It's true, randy Andy has gone to pound sandy. But before we say goodbye to the dope  who likes to grope  it's time for: It's the End of the world!! The intergovernmental panel on climate change just released its latest report, and you can guess  it's partly cloudy today with a 90% chance of Armageddon. Brian Williams: to be perfectly honest, what we learned today might just be the definition of helplessness. // Inger Andersen: nobody is safe and it is getting worse faster // MSNBC: the signs are all there. With fires raging around the world  in Greece and Turkey and in California // CBS: this summers apocalyptic wildfires in California and Greece. Floods in Belgium are just a glimpse of what can come // MSNBC: the climate is getting more hostile and today the UN said it is already too late to stop some of the devastating impacts of climate change // NBC:  rising sea levels and shrinking glaciers and arctic sea ice are irreversible for centuries or even millenniums. Wait a second guys! What about code red. I was told there would be code red!! Lester Holt: the world is at the code red stage. // Don Lemon:  it is a code red and that code red is now // CBS:  code red for humanity. The warning from a new climate report about more devastating floods and fires. Can the worst of climate change be reversed?  They all got the same memo, these fricken sheep. At this point, how can we take these dopes seriously? Weve been told ""time's up"" more often than Andrew Cuomo.  They tell us every damn decade that we have one decade left. These people are wrong more times than Kilmeades barber.  As Bjorn Lomborg points out in the New York Post  the report has some sensible stuff  reconfirming that, unlike the last five inches of Kats hair, global warming is real. But there's something mind-blowing no one wants to talk about. Climate change is saving hundreds of thousands of lives. I repeat: climate change is saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Shush, did you hear that? I think its John Kerrys face melting.  Fact: more people died from cold weather than hot. A new Lancet study reports that while a half million people die from heat per year, roughly 4.5 million die from the cold. More than have officially died worldwide from COVID, but global warming has reduced the intensity of extreme cold weather. According to Lomborg: ""as temperatures have increased over the past two decades, that has caused an extra 116,000 heat deaths each year... But... Because global warming has also reduced cold waves, we now see 283,000 fewer cold deaths."" I would say do the math, but I don't want to make Kat cry on national TV. I will make it simple: 283,000 minus 116,000 equals 167,000 lives saved each year. You hear that Greta. Climate change is saving lives. Not costing them. No wonder shes mad. If you think about it, Jesse Watters has saved thousands of lives just by the amount of hairspray he uses every day. Maybe that's how he saved the world! There's some other surprising news you won't hear from Bill Nye the science lie. For example, more CO2 in the atmosphere leads to a greening of the planet. One NASA study, Lomborg points out, found that climate change added an ""area of green equivalent that's twice the size of the US. Or one Tyrus. To put it another way... Every time Joy Behar burps, the rain forest grows by 18%. You won't hear that on CNN. They're too busy blaming you for killing the earth, or democracy itself. Lets see what they're covering now. Skit of man and woman blaming America for climate change and other problems Often times the media Apocalypto's will try to scare you by targeting your pocketbook. Meaning, what will this cost you in prosperity. Well, due to climate change, the average earthling will only be 436% as well off in 2100 as they are now. Instead of 450%. That's it. Who cares!? The difference is enough to pay for one solar panel.  KERRY FAMILY PRIVATE JET HAS TAKEN 16 FLIGHTS THIS YEAR ALONE, RECORDS SHOW Which is a bummer because by 2100 we'll all be killed by homeless polar bears. Except for me. In 2050, Im planning to have my head placed in a vat of life-sustaining chemicals, where Ill continue to do this show forever. Skit of Greg's head in a jar, hosting his show Wow, I am still sexier than ever. So  even as we hear this good news from the likes of Lomborg and others  you won't hear it anywhere else. Because the activist class needs to keep us in fear. As a way to control us. It's the same plan wives having been using on their husbands for years. Which, as the activists now see, works great. And they must be looking at covid, and thinking  why didn't we think of that!   Fear literally makes people ask the government to make them prisoners. Did you see how easy it was to shut down a country?  Unless its Barack Obamas birthday, of course. Then break out the bong and let's party.

Scientists challenge 'alarm bells' in IPCC climate change report: 'Not the end of the world',"In the first release of a three-part report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned this week of the consequences of a rapidly warming world spurred largely by human-influenced climate change. ""The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhousegas emissions from fossil-fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk,"" United Nations General Secretary Antonio Guterres said. ""Global heating is affecting every region on Earth, with many of the changes becoming irreversible."" But, not everyone agrees with Guterres and the panels nearly 4,000-page Sixth Assessment Report.  5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW UN REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE ""The IPCC is an excellent source for climate science, but we tend to focus very selectively on the worst news, often overstating the effects of climate change on extreme weather events. Often adaptation is ignored, although it can alleviate much or sometimes almost all of climate damages,"" Bjorn Lomborg, president of the Copenhagen Consensus and visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover institution, said in an emailed statement to Fox News on Wednesday.  ""Although climate change in total has negative impacts, we rarely hear about the positive impacts, such as a profound global greening of the planet, equivalent to two more continents of green, each the size of Australia."" Lomborg wrote in a New York Post article on Monday urging readings not to buy alarmism and ""scare stories on climate impacts,"" and that the U.N. has ""a long history of claiming catastrophe is right around the corner,"" writing about problems related to ""one-sided"" and negative thinking on climate change. Lomborg said that while climate change is a ""real problem that we should fix smartly,"" it wont be as catastrophic as some present it to be and that humans adaptive capacities are not properly being taken into account. The IPCC report is compiled by more than 200 of the worlds leading climate scientists from 66 countries, including research from thousands of papers. The last one was released in 2013. It says global temperatures have reached their highest level in more than 100,000 years, rising by 1.1 degrees Celsius since the 19th century, with almost all warming since pre-industrial times caused by the release of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide and methane. As temperatures rise, the scientists note that ice melt and sea level rise have been accelerating, with extreme weather events like rainfall and drought also expected to worsen and become more frequent as further warming is ""locked in."" The 2015 Paris climate accord target of limiting global warming to an increase of 2 degrees Celsius by the year 2100  ideally, an increase of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius  is practically unattainable according to five scenarios in which scientists all concluded that the world would see an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the 2030s. Three of the scenarios saw temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius. ""The whole notion is just built on this assumption that warming is bad to start with,"" former Trump/Pence EPA Transition Team member and JunkScience.com founder Steve Milloy told Fox News on Wednesday, calling the reports extreme weather claims ""very unlikely.""  ""This new report, number one, theres nothing new in it. Theres no new science, the alarm is just, you know, its more code red than it was five, six years ago  the last time they came out with one of these things,"" the IPCC was ""backing off their most extreme projections because none of that  obviously  is going to happen."" Speaking with Fox News the same day, Competitive Enterprise Institute Center for Energy and Environment senior fellow and ICPP reviewer Patrick J. Michaels said he believes the report and its conclusions were ""mired in the atmosphere of unreality."" DROUGHT-STRICKEN CALIFORNIA TOWN TO TOURISTS: 'PLEASE CONSERVE' ""The U.N. has been pushing the climate story since 1988  thats a long time ago  when it established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And, that panel was established specifically to provide what they call the basis for a possible treaty on climate. Any committee that is assigned such a specific assignment will do exactly as it was told. And, therefore, the composition of the [IPCC]  the authors  are selectively chosen because they know the results they are going to get,"" he said. ""The real reason this report is so extreme is that the previous reports have not elicited the actions that its proponents wanted,"" Michaels noted. ""And, in fact, people are becoming increasingly tired of stories about the end of the world."" Michaels, a past president of the American Association of State Climatologists and program chair for the Committee on Applied Climatology of the American Meteorological Society, took issue with the reports Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) modeling. Michaels, who says he is not a climate change skeptic, said if the report had used best practice models instead the issue would have ""fallen apart."" That said, the report states that CMIP6 modeling includes ""new and better representation of physical, chemical and biological processes, as well as higher resolution, compared to climate models considered in previous IPCC assessment reports."" David Legates, a professor of climatology at the University of Delaware and a policy expert at the Heartland Institute, took issue with what he says is the political nature of the report. ""So, its a panel of government officials who have been selected by the various governments. And, of course, they all have axes to grind,"" the former Trump-era National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) senior official said. ""So, [there are] certain things they want to say. [There are] certain things they want to guarantee. Many of these nations want to make sure that carbon dioxide is an evil gas because if we can tax it we can make sure that we can get our cut of the money that theyre taking away from other people.' And so, they have a vested interest in not the science  whatever that may be  but in stating that carbon dioxide is sort of an evil gas and therefore has to be regulated and has to be controlled."" For those looking to find a glimmer of hope in the new IPCC report, researchers found that majorly catastrophic disasters or ""tipping points"" were of ""low likelihood,"" including ice sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents. The report suggested that warming could be reversed through ""negative emissions""  extracting more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is added  though the term ""fossil fuels"" is not included in the summary or a Monday press release. Man-made CO2 removal ""leading to net negative emissions"" would lower CO2 in the atmosphere, a 42-page summary of the report for policymakers said. And even if this were achieved and sustained, increases in temperature would be reversed but other climate changes would continue in the ""current direction for decades to millennia."" However, the panel doesnt explain how this could be achieved and many scientists remain skeptical of its plausibility. Michael Shellenberger, the author of ""Apocalypse Never"" and founder and president of Environmental Progress, told Fox News that most of the important trends regarding climate change are currently headed in the right direction."" ""Climate change is real. Its caused by human emissions  at least a significant amount of it is. And, we should try to do something about it because  all else being equal  its better for temperatures to not change. But, of course, not all else is equal,"" he said. ""Climate change is being caused by human emissions, which are caused by humans trying to improve lives for themselves and their children. Not just through fossil fuel use but also through land-use change,"" he continued. ""And so, youre always looking to balance the benefits of energy consumption with the downsides. But, the trends are mostly going in the right direction."" Shellenberger said the IPCC reports ""scary"" scenarios were inaccurate because there is ""no possibility"" that they could occur due to the usage of natural gas over coal across the world. The environmental journalist said that while the IPCC science is ""mostly fine,"" he highlighted that there are ""some games that get played"" in the panels reports, including ""a bunch of scenarios that basically everybody acknowledges [are] not going to happen because were not going to increase coal use sixfold.""  The reports claim that the world is seeing more extreme weather is misleading, Shellenberger says, because it leads people to think that disasters are getting worse. Droughts can be worsened by warmer temperatures but are explained by natural variability and high-intensity fires can be avoided by better forest management, he argued  though allowing that climate scientists can point to longer fire seasons over larger geographic areas. Nevertheless, he said human beings are more resilient to extreme weather events and carbon emissions would go down globally over the coming decade. ""The takeaway is that climate change is not what people think it is. It is significantly outweighed by things like droughts, which are still determined by natural variables and by economic development and preparedness, and were just so much better prepared,"" he told Fox News. ""Were more resilient to changing temperatures than weve ever been and its just not the end of the world.""",12/08/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/us/ipcc-climate-change-reports-claims-challenged-by-skeptics
CBS News mocked for report claiming 'climate change helped strengthen the Taliban',"CBS News raised eyebrows on Friday for a report that claimed climate change had helped strengthen the Taliban, which has now taken over Afghanistan and trapped thousands of Americans behind enemy lines.  In the report titled ""How climate change helped strengthen the Taliban,"" CBS News' climate and energy reporter Cara Korte highlighted that ""rural Afghanistan"" has been ""rocked by climate change,"" and said the Taliban has ""taken advantage"" of those who have suffered from floods and droughts that have destroyed their crops and left them hungry.  The report also said that snow and glaciers in the north mountains ""have melted more quickly and earlier than ever before,"" leading to flooding and droughts in the winter while ""heavy precipitation"" has increased in the south and west ""by 10 to 25% over the past 30 years."" REPORTERS PERPLEXED BY BIDEN'S COMMENTS ON AFGHAN WITHDRAWAL: THE REALITY AND THE RHETORIC ARE MILES APART Kamal Alam, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's South Asia Center, told CBS News the Taliban exploits Afghan farmers, who are recruited by the terror group, where they can make more money than they could as farmers.

"Matthew Dowd predicts 100 million deaths this year from climate change, blames Republicans","Political analyst Matthew Dowd predicted on Thursday the world will see more deaths due to climate change this year than ""all of the World Wars in the last 100 years combined."" Dowd appeared on MSNBCs ""Deadline White House"" to discuss the devastation from Hurricane Ida and insisted the powerful storm was caused by climate change, and we could be seeing worse storms in the future. ""Were about to have more deaths in a year in the globe because of climate change than all of the World Wars in the last 100 years combined,"" Dowd warned viewers. LAFOURCHE PARISH REELING FROM HURRICANE IDA BUT RESILIENT: ITS BEEN A STRUGGLE BUT WERE DOING OK  An estimate of over 100 million people died from World War I and World War II.  He added that we have only ""12 to 24 months"" to act before the situation becomes ""irreversible."" ""We are fast approaching, unless we fundamentally do something in the next 12 to 24 months, an irreversible problem were going to be facing this week every single week. And its going to include droughts, its going to include deaths, its going to include freezes, its going to include all of that,"" he said.  Dowd's comment echoes far-left climate alarmists who predict doom if drastic action to address climate change isn't taken. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., predicted in 2019 that the world only has 12 years to address climate change or the world will end.  Dowd placed the blame for the devastation from Hurricane Ida solely on Republicans for not believing in ""the common good"" and ""discounting science."" ""Theres not equal blame, and theres not both sides on anything close to this issue. Actually, both sides stuff has hurt us in getting anything done. There is one side that has listened to science, and one side that hasnt,"" Dowd said.  ""Fundamentally, the problem is Republicans dont believe in the common good. That has affected their COVID response. That affects their response to guns. That affects their response to everything. They dont believe in the common good, and they discount science. And when you dont believe in the common good, and you discount science, we end up here doing nothing about climate change in our time.""  Hurricane Ida has caused unprecedented damage as it passed through Louisiana and continued to bring massive storms and flooding to the northeast throughout the week.",02/09/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-matthew-dowd-100-million-climate-change-deaths
"Biden blames Northeast storm damage on climate change, calls on Congress to pass infrastructure bill","President Biden toured storm-ravaged areas of New York and New Jersey Tuesday and placed blame for the devastation on climate change.

""And the whole segment of our population denying this thing called climate change. Even the climate skeptics are seeing that this really does matter."" BIDEN HECKLED IN NEW JERSEY FOR STRANDING AMERICANS IN AFGHANISTAN: 'HE WILL LEAVE YOU BEHIND' The president added that scientists have concluded the country is facing a ""code red"" threat from climate change and that the crisis is an ""existential threat to our lives."" That's not hyperbole,"" Biden said. ""That is a fact."" Biden touted his ""Build Back Better"" spending plans on infrastructure as a way to ensure that devastation from deadly storms would not happen in the future. HURRICANE LARRY COULD IMPACT NEW JERSEY, EAST COAST SHORES ""We can stop it from getting worse,"" Biden said, explaining that his infrastructure spending would address problems caused by the storm, including paying for ""flood-proof power stations"" and ""underground electrical lines."" The president's visit comes after he approved a disaster declaration for New York state, clearing the way for officials to access federal relief funding to aid recovery efforts. The decision came one day after Biden approved a similar disaster declaration for six counties in New Jersey. The action made federal funding available to affected individuals. The assistance, according to the White House, can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the storm.  At least 50 people were killed across six states as the remnants of Hurricane Ida brought record rainfall to the Eastern seaboard. The hurricane initially made landfall in Louisiana, causing major damage and leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's office said the hurricane resulted in more than $50 million in damage to public infrastructure and property, according to estimates from state and federal experts. Hochul directed an additional $378 million in existing FEMA funds toward disaster mitigation efforts within the state.

"How federal regulation, not climate change, explains California's wildfire crisis: experts","Democrats like President Biden often point to California's devastating wildfires as evidence of climate change, but center-right policy experts claim that federal regulation and poor forest management, not climate change, best explain the fiery devastation in the Golden State. ""The problem is not global warming or any other extraneous factor, it's forest mismanagement,"" Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in a press call with other center-right experts. ""I would call it eco-imperialism."" In a separate interview with Fox News, Ebell explained that the federal government owns 57 percent of the forest land in California, but approximately 80 percent of the lumber produced in California comes from private lands, thanks to federal regulation and misconceptions about the role of logging in forest management. While environmentalists see logging as an exploitation of the environment, logging actually serves a key role in removing extra lumber that can build up and increase the risk of devastating fires. BIDEN BLAMES NORTHEAST STORM DAMAGE ON CLIMATE CHANGE, CALLS ON CONGRESS TO PASS INFRASTRUCTURE BILL By ""eco-imperialism,"" Ebell told Fox News, he means that ""the support for locking things up and not using them is really based on the fact that most of the decision-makers live in urban areas and they dont know what the forests need but they believe that locking them up is the way to preserve the environment."" 'The federal government actually controls the rural economies of the Western states,"" the analyst explained. While the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service ""believed in the productive use of the resources  timber, mining, oil and gas production"" for decades, these agencies have severely restricted that use since the 1990s. In 1990, Ebell said, the Forest Service cut about 12 billion board-feet of timber per year, while the national forests under its purview added about 17 billion board-feet of timber per year. After the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the northern spotted owl on the endangered species list in 1990, agencies started to restrict logging in national forests. By 2008 or 2009, the Forest Service was only cutting about 1 billion board-feet of timber per year. Logging increased slightly under President Barack Obama, and the Trump administration aimed to increase logging to 4 billion board-feet in the first term, then 8 billion in a hypothetical second term. The Biden administration has pledged to decrease logging once again.  EXPLOSIVE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES COULD BURN INTO DECEMBER, EXPERTS WARN Even Trump's turnaround proved difficult, since most of the sawmills had closed, Ebell explained. About 175 sawmills closed in the 1990s. Due to the decrease in logging, the analyst explained, California's forests have experienced a huge fuel build-up, and during times of drought, trees become susceptible to insects and disease, leaving ""hundreds of millions of dead trees."" Regular fires fulfill a vital role in a forest ecosystem, clearing out excess brush and helping some seeds to sprout, while leaving many large trees intact. Yet when fuel builds up, and dead trees pile on one another, ""there's no green stuff to keep the fire down,"" Ebell explained. ""Going down from 12 billion board-feet to 2 billion board-feet has not only destroyed these areas economically,"" the analyst told Fox News. ""Theres a big difference between just a forest fire and what were having now. This build-up leads to very hot fires, catastrophic fires, and it will burn everything. These fires even scorch the soil  they are incredibly destructive to the environment."" Ebell dismissed the idea that climate change explains these destructive fires. ""Having the outside temperature be five degrees higher than last year wont make an impact on a fire thats a hundred degrees hotter than it should be,"" he told Fox News. Ebell also faulted the Forest Service for banning firefighting during the night  when temperatures are cooler. He also noted that federal regulations disincentivize controlled burns, one of the best ways to reduce fuel in a forest. While fires do not count as emissions under the Clean Air Act, controlled burns do. Gregory Wrightstone, a geologist and executive director of the CO2 Coalition, also briefed reporters on the call concerning the California wildfires. ""Th current western drought has been called unusual and unprecedented,"" Wrightstone noted. ""This is categorically false. There were many other periods in the southwestern United States that experienced worse draughts."" He mentioned the Great Anasazi Drought of 1275 that drove the Anasazi people from the Southwest. Steve Milloy, a former Trump-Pence EPA transition member and founder of JunkScience.com, compared the carbon emissions from the California fires with the carbon emissions that California has decreased through its cap-and-trade system since 2012. The cap-and-trade system  which Milloy noted, ""cost consumers and businesses billions and billions of dollars""  reduced emissions by approximately 180 million tons. Yet California wildfires have emitted approximately 280 million tons since 2012.   ""Perhaps the greatest emitter in California is government failure,"" Milloy quipped. ""If California is worried about emissions, perhaps it might want to start by managing these forest fires."" Neither the Forest Service nor the Bureau of Land Management responded to Fox News' request for comment.",09/09/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-federal-regulation-not-climate-change-explains-californias-wildfire-crisis
Biden says climate change causing severe weather is 'no longer subject to debate',"President Biden said that severe weather and wildfires that the country has seen in recent weeks is caused by man-made climate change, arguing that the point is settled. ""We know what the driver is, climate change. We know what's causing climate change, human activity,"" Biden said during an appearance at Colorado's National Renewable Energy Laboratory Tuesday. ""This is no longer subject to debate."" But some do still debate whether climate change plays a large part in natural disasters such as California wildfires and hurricanes, as Biden suggested. FIREFIGHTER BATTLING WESTERN WILDFIRES SHARES HIS STORY ON FRONT LINES ""When I hear climate change discussed, its suggested that its a major reason and its not,"" Scott Stevens of the University of California told Forbes last year when discussing wildfires. Stevens' view was echoed by University of Wisconsin geographer Paul Robbins, who argued such fires are not something new. ""The idea that fire is somehow new... a product solely of climate change, and part of a moral crusade for the soul of the nation, borders on the insane,"" Robbins said. Nick Loris, an economist who focuses on energy, environmental and regulatory issues as the Herbert and Joyce Morgan fellow at The Heritage Foundation, has also disputed the idea that climate change is causing an uptick in hurricane activity. ""There's conflicting literature in the scientific community as to what this increased temperature and increased ocean temperature has done towards just the size and magnitude of hurricane,"" Loris said during a 2018 interview. ""The reason that we keep hearing this isn't all too unsurprising, it's to have this emotion that we need action on climate change, particularly that we need to restrict the use of coal, oil and natural gas, which provide 80% of America's energy needs and provide 80% of the world's energy needs."" But others agree with Biden's assessment of the problem, including National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist James P. Kossin. ""Its very likely that human-caused climate change contributed to that anomalously warm ocean,"" Kossin said last month. ""Climate change is making it more likely for hurricanes to behave in certain ways."" According to Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one such way oceans can impact storm behavior is through rising sea levels. ""Potential intensity is going up,"" Emanuel said. ""We predicted it would go up 30 years ago, and the observations show it going up."" ""Even if storms themselves werent changing, the storm surge is riding on an elevated sea level,"" he added. ""If Sandys storm surge had occurred in 1912 rather than 2012...  it probably wouldnt have flooded Lower Manhattan.""  Biden also warned that the problem of climate change was in dire need of being addressed, arguing that this was a ""decisive decade"" in the battle against the problem. ""We don't have a lot of time,"" Biden said. ""We don't have much more than 10 years... for real. This is a decisive decade.""",14/09/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-climate-change-causing-severe-weather-is-no-longer-subject-to-debate
Pelosi says addressing climate change with China is 'overriding issue' despite human rights abuses,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that opening a dialogue with China on climate change must take priority as the ""overriding issue,"" despite a slurry of geopolitical threats posed by the communist nation.  ""The situation with China is tightening, its getting worse,"" she said at an event in Cambridge, England.  BIDEN, IN CALL WITH CHINA'S XI JINPING, SETS 'GUARDRAILS' TO ENSURE 'COMPETITION DOES NOT VEER INTO CONFLICT' Pelosi, D-Calif., pointed to human rights abuses  including the Uyghur genocide in western China  security threats and economic challenges China poses for the U.S. but said those issues were subsidiary compared to climate change.  ""With their military aggression in the South China Sea, with their continuation of genocide with the Uyghurs in Xinjiang province, with their violation of the cultural... religious priority of Tibet, with their suppression of democracy in Hong Kong and other parts of China as well  theyre just getting worse in terms of suppression,"" the House speaker said.  ""Having said all of that... we have to work together on climate,"" she added. ""Climate is an overriding issue and China is a leading emitter in the world  U.S. too, developed world too  but we must work together. We have to have a level of communication  whether its COVID, whether it's terrorism or whether it's climate."" Pelosis plea for an open dialogue comes just one week after President Biden held his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping since February.  FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS US-AUSTRALIA SUBMARINE DEAL A 'STAB IN THE BACK' The White House did not disclose specifically what was discussed in the 90-minute conversation but said the call was a ""broad, strategic discussion in which they discussed areas where our interests converge, and areas where our interests, values and perspectives diverge.""  ""They agreed to engage on both sets of issues openly and straightforwardly,"" the White House said.  U.S.-China relations have remained tense since the Trump administration when the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) came under fire for its alleged role in the coronavirus pandemic.  The Biden administration has clashed with the PRC over human rights abuses committed by China in the Xinjiang province and Hong Kong, along with its aggressive military actions in the South China Sea and intimidation campaign against Taiwan.   Pelosi said she has frequented China on several occasions during her time in office and claimed to have been accused of being the ""worst American in China""  a criticism she said she wears with a ""badge of honor.""

Well, the Chinese love that math, because they get to trade all their horrible trade abuses and the equities and the trade imbalances, as well as their human rights record, for some B.S. climate change package.  ... Well, theyll take that climate deal with a slight side of conflict of interest, the Heinz will. Look. Teresa Heinz Kerryshes got up to maybe $5 million invested in this Chinese-run hedge fund and I learned today, PeteI read those long Hunter Biden emails from the laptop. Turns out, Hunter Biden and Teresa Heinz Kerrys stepson, Christopher [Heinz], founded something called Rosemont Seneca Partners. They were in the Chinese deal that Hunter promised to hold 10% for the big guy, so the Heinz and the Bidens, once again, theyre colluding on a massive scale with the Chinese and nobodys screaming ""conflict of interest here."" And I mentioned, Xi and the Chinese are loving this. Look, John Kerry was the guy who negotiated the prison release, the Iran cash deal. You know, he gave $1.7 billion to the mullahs. What did we get for that? Not very muchand it looks like he is on path to do the same with China vis-a-vis the climate. Xi is smiling from ear to coal-emitting ear.

New Yorker hosts climate change extremist who advocates for 'intelligent sabotage',"The New Yorker hosted environmental activist and professor Andreas Malm on their podcast where he promoted ""intelligent sabotage"" and property damage as a way to stop climate change.  ""Andreas Malm insists that the environmental movement rethink its roots in nonviolence and instead embrace intelligent sabotage,"" the description of the interview states. In the podcast, Malm, who is a professor from Lund University, emphasized ""a call for escalation, a call for the movement to diversify its tactics and move away from an exclusive focus on polite, gentle and perfectly peaceful civil disobedience."" ""I am recommending that the movement continues with mass action and civil disobedience, but also opens up for property destruction,"" Malm said. While Malm, who is a human ecology professor at Lund University does not dismiss peaceful demonstrations and does not condone hurting people, he did emphasize that destroying private property would not be ""morally illegitimate."" ""If people in that region were to attack the construction equipment or blow up the pipeline before its completed, I would be all in favor of that. I dont see how that property damage could be considered morally illegitimate given what we know of the consequence of such projects,"" Malm said. PETER DOOCY, LAWRENCE JONES DISCUSS REPORTING ON KEY ISSUES ON LIFE, LIBERTY &amp; LEVIN  ""The guest literally calls for blowing up pipelines. Not a metaphor. @NewYorker literally platforming a terrorist,"" Pluribus editor Jeryl Bier said.  Malm has advocated for property damage in the past. In his book, ""How to Blow Up a Pipeline,"" he supported and reasoned the need for violence to promote climate change causes. One example from his book, he advocated for damaging and destroying carbon-dioxide emitting devices. ""Damage and destroy new CO2-emitting devices. Put them out of commission, pick them apart, demolish them, burn them, blow them up. Let the capitalists who keep on investing in the fire know that their properties will be trashed,"" Malm wrote.  Critics called out the New Yorker for ""normalizing"" or ""endorsing"" political violence for climate change. ""I think it's weird that guys who don't own any guns and certainly don't know how to use them seek to normalize political violence. I wonder if they'll act surprised,"" Townhall.com senior editor Kurt Schlichter tweeted.  Spectator contributor Stephen Miller wrote ""For those keeping track at home, both the New Yorker and the New York Times are debating and soft endorsing terror acts against national pipelines in the name of climate.""  In July, a New York Times columnist wrote about Malms book and excused co-terrorism against oil companies. ""Still, violence is often deployed, even if counterproductively, on behalf of causes far less consequential than the climate crisis. So skepticism of the practical benefits of violence does not fully explain its absence in a movement this vast and with consequences this grave,"" Times columnist Ezra Klein wrote.",26/09/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-yorker-platforms-climate-terrorist-advocates-sabotage
Stephen Moore: Biden thinks climate change is a bigger threat than China. He'll be sorry,"With each passing week, it looks like World War III -- between America and China -- is coming sooner than we think. It's not going to be fought with bullets or aircraft carriers, although the Chinese are building up their military in an aggressive and threatening way.  This will more likely be an all-out economic war for global supremacy. The yuan versus the dollar. The Nasdaq versus the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, America is asleep at the switch -- at least, the Biden administration is. This is the worst possible time to be raising tax rates on American companies (Our business tax rates would be higher than China's under President Joe Biden's plan!), dismantling American energy (at a time when China is running 1,000 dirty coal plants with dozens more in construction), and running up the national debt (with China a major purchaser of the bonds).  Love Donald Trump or hate him, he was a president who put America first and recognized the predatory nature of the Chinese regime. He got tough with President Xi Jinping and overturned one-sided trade deals. His strategy was to do what former President Ronald Reagan did to win the Cold War: Make America tremendously prosperous by building up our strategic industries in a way that the Soviet Union or China couldn't compete with.  XI JINPING SCRUTINIZES CHINESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TIES WITH PRIVATE FIRMS The danger is that we now have a president in Biden who thinks that climate change is a bigger threat to the world than the Maoists in Beijing.  And make no mistake about it; the communists are back in charge in China. Jinping has basically announced himself to be president for life, as democracy and free elections fly out the window. China is also sprinting back to command and control fascist government and industry ""cooperation."" That's a model that will eventually implode, but as we learned from the Soviet menace, they can do a lot of damage to peace and prosperity in the meantime. It's no accident that China's economy and stock market are faltering. In the last year, as the U.S. stock market has risen by about 20% (thanks to Operation Warp Speed), China's Shanghai stock market went down 15%. They are sprinting toward socialism faster than we are... for now.  The Chinese stock market jitters reflect global investors' irritation with the more frequent political interventions in business affairs. As Foreign Affairs magazine recently put it regarding these iron-fisted interferences into the business activities of its largest companies: ""Xi has placed China on a risky trajectory, one that threatens the (free market) achievements of his predecessors.""  BEYOND EVERGRANDE, CHINAS PROPERTY MARKET FACES A $5 TRILLION RECKONING In short, events of recent months both militarily and economically confirm that the modern Maoists are firmly entrenched in Beijing, and capitalism is losing. Jinping's administration simply doesn't get what George H.W. Bush once so eloquently described as ""that freedom thing.""  Militant social controls and restraints on individual liberty are now being matched with economic controls on Chinese megacorporations that are trying to vie for industry supremacy in technology, biology, manufacturing and transportation. Is all of this reminiscent of Japan circa 1939?  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER What is the Biden administration's response to these threats? The massive $5 trillion spend, tax and borrow bill he is steamrolling through Congress will impair American economic supremacy almost overnight.  Under Trump, tax rate reductions led to a $1 trillion infusion of capital from around the world, coming back to these shores to build up our industrial might. Biden's tax policies will have the reverse effect: deindustrialization.  We are, as a nation, now back to importing tens of billions of dollars of energy from OPEC and Russia instead of selling the hundreds of years' worth of oil, gas and coal.  Do the progressives who now run Washington really believe we are going to defeat the rising Communist China threat by building windmills? Do they think that redistributing income and wealth makes more sense than creating it? Will we be in any economic shape to repel China's militaristic advances in the South China Sea, in India, in Africa and perhaps on to the shores of Taiwan with the policies in place in Washington today?  Doubtful.   The war with China is on. Right now, only one country is fighting -- China. Let's not let another Afghanistan catastrophe happen in Asia.  Reagan was right. Strong at home. Strong abroad. Today, are we either? CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEPHEN MOORE",12/10/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-climate-change-threat-china-stephen-moore
Psaki refers to climate change as a ??risis??after failing to do so for the border,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that there is a ""crisis"" when it comes to climate change in the world, despite refusing to use the same label to acknowledge ongoing problems at the southern border. Asked by a reporter during the White House briefing about protests and demands from climate activists in Washington, D.C., Psaki said that President Joe Biden and his administration are ""listening to advocates and people who have been elevating the issue of climate for decades."" She pointed to Biden's ""enormous investment and commitment to addressing the climate crisis that's in his legislative agenda that's currently working its way through Congress now."" BIDEN CONTINUES NEWFOUND PRESIDENTIAL TRADITION, TURNS BACK ON REPORTERS AND EXITS WITHOUT TAKING QUESTIONS Despite efforts by the Biden administration not to refer to the situation at the border as a ""crisis,"" Psaki, herself, slipped up during a March briefing and did just that.  Asked about certain COVID-19 doses being shared with Mexico, Psaki said, ""There have been expectations set outside of, unrelated to, any vaccine doses or requests for them, that they would be partners in dealing with the crisis on the border.""  She later walked back her remarks, using the phrase ""challenges at the border."" Prior to Psaki's slip up, she was asked in March whether she believed there was a ""crisis at the border,"" to which she said ""new labels"" weren't necessary for what is a ""top priority"" of the Biden Administration.  Biden also at one point referenced a ""crisis"" at the border, a move Psaki was forced to defend. After Biden pointed to ""the crisis that ended up on the border with young people,"" Psaki claimed Biden ""does not feel that children coming to our border seeking refuge from violence, economic hardships, and other dire circumstances is a crisis."" Psaki previously referred to climate change as a ""crisis"" in a tweet criticizing former President Donald Trump on the subject. She called gun violence a ""crisis"" in an August 2019 tweet. At least 160,000 illegal immigrants have been released into the U.S. by the Biden administration since March, Border Patrol documents obtained by Fox News show.

Prince William criticizes space tourism at the expense of solving climate change,"Prince William criticized space tourism this week, saying that innovators should be focused on saving Earth, not looking for a new planet to inhabit.  ""We need some of the world's greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,"" William told the BBC in an interview airing Thursday. ""I think that ultimately is what sold it for me - that really is quite crucial to be focusing on this [planet] rather than giving up and heading out into space to try and think of solutions for the future."" He said he is also concerned about the carbon cost of space flights.

Bezos, Virgins Richard Branson and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have all competitively ventured into space tourism as of late and Musk frequently talks about the importance of making humankind ""interplanetary"" especially if Earth becomes uninhabitable.  The prince will also be awarding 1 million grants on Sunday through his inaugural Earthshot Prize to innovators working to solve climate change.   Williams father, Prince Charles, has also long been an advocate for climate change awareness and William said it would be an ""absolute disaster"" if his son Prince George, 8, was still having the same conversation about global warming in ""like 30 years' time whatever, still saying the same thing, because by then we will be too late.""",14/10/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/world/prince-william-criticizes-space-tourism-at-the-expense-of-solving-climate-change
Queen Elizabeth on climate change: HM appears to criticize global inaction in off-mic comments,"Queen Elizabeth II appeared to criticize the global lack of action on climate change when her comments were picked up on a microphone at an event on Thursday. The 95-year-old British monarch was filmed on a phone as she visited Cardiff to open the Welsh parliament. At one point, speaking to her daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and parliament presiding officer Elin Jones, she said ""Ive been hearing all about COP ... I still dont know whos coming."" On the recording, parts of which are inaudible, the queen also appears to say it is ""irritating"" when ""they talk, but they dont do."" The queen is due to welcome leaders from around the world to COP26, a United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, at the end of the month. Several heads of state or government, including Chinas Xi Jinping, have not said whether they will attend. A government minister, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, said the queens comments had not been intended for broadcast. ""I think comments made in private should stay private, but we all share the desire to see progress made and we know there will be hundreds of leaders coming to Glasgow for COP,"" he told Sky News.

"Biden admin. 'officially recognizing' link between climate change, migration","The Biden administration on Thursday is ""officially recognizing and reporting"" on the ""linkage"" between climate change and migration, after the U.S. saw the highest number of border detentions in a year since 1986. Border Patrol arrests soared over 1.7 million during the 2021 fiscal year, which ended in September.  Officials rolled out a number of government analyses aimed at tackling climate change, which President Biden has warned will be the ""greatest threat"" to Americas national security in the coming years. BORDER ARRESTS HIT HIGHEST LEVELS SINCE 1986'S AMNESTY BILL: CBP DATA ""It is definitely a security issue,"" an official said. The analyses fulfill requirements of Bidens Jan. 27 executive order on tackling climate change  as well as his Feb. 29 executive order to rebuild and enhance programs to resettle refugees and plan for the ""impact of climate change on migration."" ""These analyses will serve as a foundation for our critical work on climate and security moving forward,"" the officials said. The Department of Homeland Security is set to roll out its ""strategic framework"" to tackle climate change, which would focus on ""empowering individuals and communities to develop climate resilience;"" ""building readiness to respond to increases in climate-driven emergencies;"" ""incorporating climate science as a strategy for policy programs and budgets;"" investing in a ""sustainable and resilient"" DHS; and ""ensuring the DHS workforce is ""informed by climate change."" Officials said the DHS analysis and assessment marked ""the first time the U.S. government is officially recognizing and reporting on the linkage between climate change and migration."" BIDEN WARNS CLIMATE CHANGE IS 'GREATEST THREAT' TO U.S. SECURITY: 'THIS IS NOT A JOKE' ""The report identifies migration as an important form of adaptation to the effects of climate change, and, in some cases, an essential response to the climate threats to livelihood and well being,"" an official said, adding that the administration described migration as a ""purely negative coping mechanism."" The administration's goals have been ""to ensure that migration, for any reason, is done in a safe, orderly and human pathway,"" an official said. Officials said the DHS analysis called for the development of humanitarian assistance programs to ""help address the underlying causes of forced migration"" and ""displacement in the face of insecurity."" Officials said it will also address how ""individual human security can decrease the likelihood of migration."" OBAMA TO ATTEND U.N. CLIMATE SUMMIT IN GLASGOW ""It is critical to approach these efforts in a way that acknowledges that, in almost all cases, climate change is not the sole driver of migration,"" the official said. ""The U.S. has a compelling national interest in strengthening global protections for individuals and groups displaced by the impacts of climate change.""  The official added that the administration is going to work to identify ways to apply ""existing protection framework"" in the context of ""climate-related displacement"" to identify ""gaps"" where the United States could forge ""new legal pathways to protection"" for migrants impacted by climate change. The official said the National Security Council also is establishing a ""standing"" interagency working group on climate change and migration, and the director of national intelligence will oversee the development of the ""first-ever"" national intelligence estimate on climate change. Vice President Kamala Harris was tasked with addressing the ""root causes"" of migration earlier this year. She released a strategy in June to tackle the issue; at the time, she did not officially link climate to migration, but did cite ""extreme climate,"" ""extensive storm damage,"" and the issue of ""climate resiliency."" Critics said Harris has failed to control the crisis amid new indications that border arrests have soared to their highest levels in decades, and noted that she didn't visit the border for months after taking on the task. BIDEN SIGNS CLIMATE CHANGE ORDERS AMID CONCERNS OVER JOBS: 'IT IS TIME TO ACT' ""Climate change will increasingly exacerbate a number of risks to U.S. national security interests,"" the official said, noting that climate change can contribute to ""increased geopolitical tension"" as countries ""compete in the ensuing energy transition."" The administration also is releasing an analysis from the Defense Department  the first from the Pentagon focusing on the strategic mission implications of climate change, which officials described as a ""critical first step for incorporating climate change security implications"" in mission strategy plans and capabilities. ""It will consider the effects of climate change on areas, such as, how to train, fight and win in an increasingly complex environment,"" an official said, adding that the Department of Finance also will ""strive to prevent, mitigate, account for and respond to defensive security risks associated with climate change.""   The official said the Pentagon analysis also will consider how climate change could ""increase demand for defense missions and impact critical supply chain, infrastructure and readiness."" The rollout comes just weeks before President Biden and key Cabinet officials are expected to participate in the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on Nov. 1 and 2.",21/10/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-administration-recognizing-climate-change-migration-link
"FEMA announces disaster assistance, adaptation initiatives to advance climate change resilience","The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced two initiatives on Thursday to advance climate change resilience. The initiatives are the formation of a Climate Adaptation Enterprise Steering Group and a robust stakeholder engagement process established to help develop the agencys 20222026 Strategic Plan.  In a release, the agency said that the actions were critical first steps in its efforts to address the crisis.  BIDEN ADMIN 'OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZING' LINK BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE, MIGRATION ""Climate change is the crisis of this generation. Combating it requires mitigating future risks and reducing impacts,"" FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said in a statement. ""In partnership with federal science agencies, we are analyzing how climate change will increase the frequency and severity across all hazards and what next steps are necessary to protect communities nationwide. FEMA is also advancing sustainability through our facilities, operations and programs, including lowering emissions and promoting nature-based solutions."" According to FEMA, the Climate Adaption Steering Group is focused on developing a unified agency approach to address the impacts of climate change across all agency programs and operations.  The group will be co-chaired by leadership from FEMAs Office of Response and Recovery, Office of Resilience and FEMA Regions.  FEMA's 20222026 Strategic Plan is also being developed through input from both internal and external stakeholders. Following recent Biden administration executive orders on climate change, equity and environmental justice, FEMA said it would increase climate literacy among emergency managers, build climate-resilient communities and empower risk-informed decision making using a ""whole-of-community approach.""  ""As our nation confronts the impacts of climate change, the challenge is clear. It is imperative that we invest in building a more resilient nation. Our programs and policies must protect communities and the economy from the worst impacts of climate-related disasters before they occur,"" Criswell said. The administration has issued several climate change-related executive orders since taking office in January, including an ""Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,"" an ""Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk"" and an ""Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis."" The White House has also rolled back tens of Trump-era environmental policies with the intention to take on many more. US CITIES WITH WORST AIR POLLUTION RANKED: REPORT This weekend, President Biden will meet with world leaders in Rome for the G-20 Summit and will later attend the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. All of this comes amidst continued haggling in Congress over legislation to advance U.S. climate goals and as scientists continue to provide dire messages on the future of planet Earth. In a list of additional resilience measures, FEMA said it would continue to develop new initiatives to respond to the climate crisis through its existing authorities and responsibilities.  For example, FEMA is developing its National Risk Index, announcing funding opportunities to aid states and communities in disaster preparation via FEMAs Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant programs, implementing the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, funding mitigation efforts in FEMAs Individuals and Households Program to help homeowners rebuild after disasters, fixing flood insurance inequities and updating the National Flood Insurance Program's pricing methodology, updating the ""Building Codes Toolkit For Building Owners and Occupants"" and hosting the sixth annual Resilient Nation Partnership Network Forum virtually throughout the month of October with NASA.  ""Communities across the country continue to witness the devastating and increasing impacts of hurricanes, floods, wildfires, droughts and other weather events,"" FEMA said in a statement. ""The increase and severity of disasters burden our emergency management partners and disproportionately impact historically underserved communities. FEMA is working across the agency and with partners to identify a path forward."" In an August report, UN climate scientists warned that the Earth is getting so hot that temperatures in about a decade will probably blow past a level of warming that world leaders have sought to prevent, calling it a ""code red for humanity,""  though easing back a bit on the likelihood of the absolute worst climate catastrophes.  Over the past 60 years, the Earth has been warmed by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit due to the impact of human-caused climate change. Scientists say that the number and intensity of weather and climate-related events will increase in the coming years due to the impacts of human-caused climate change.

"With COP26 climate change conference underway, world leaders look toward drastic cuts in emissions","As the climate change conference begins this week in Glasgow, Scotland, keep in mind two numbers: 1.5 and 45. Most world leaders have agreed to the scientific consensus view that the planet is a ticking time bomb. If temperatures increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) the world cannot avoid catastrophic climate change. BIDEN SENDS ARMY OF AIDES, CABINET MEMBERS TO GLASGOW CLIMATE SUMMIT AMID MAJOR PROBLEMS AT HOME To avoid this, the roughly 100 heads of state attending must agree to cuts that collectively equal a net global emissions reduction of greenhouse gases of 45% by 2030, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  To achieve that figure, the U.N. Environmental Program says countries must cut greenhouse gas emissions by 7.6% annually over the next eight years. Every fraction of a degree of warming, a U.N. panel says, will produce more wildfires, floods and famine. There are two ways to get there. One uses natural gas as a bridge fuel to augment wind and solar. The other ends all new fossil fuel production. Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., says that would be a disaster. ""We're going to have a 50% increase in energy demand globally over the next 29 years, a 40% increase in natural gas demand,"" he says. ""We can either provide those clean energy solutions out of the United States or we can allow China to service those countries and that demand, we can allow Vladimir Putin to do it. It doesn't make sense."" The Biden administration proposes the U.S. reduce its emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, roughly double the U.S.' previous goal. The 27 nations of the E.U. vowed to reduce their emissions by 55% below 1990 levels by 2030, or roughly 7% a year. Earlier this year, Japan raised its targeted reduction to 46% from 26% from 2013 levels. ""We are determined to meet our goal of a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030,"" says Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. ""The planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rules for planets. We have to pass this legislation now."" OBAMA TO ATTEND UN CLIMATE SUMMIT IN GLASGOW The legislation Markey supports and President Biden proposes rewards utilities that replace coal and natural gas with wind and solar, while penalizing those that don't. In the transportation sector, Biden favors subsidies of up to $12,500 to purchase electric cars. There are five major greenhouse gases. The largest, carbon dioxide, comes from two major sources, vehicles and power plants. China, the worlds largest polluter, says its emissions are still rising but should peak before 2030. It pledges to spend more on nuclear and renewables, but last year it added three-quarters of all the worlds new coal plants, according to Global Energy Monitor. Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels. Other major emitters, like India and Russia, have not submitted any new pledges to cut their pollution.  Australia, a big exporter of coal and a large per capita emitter of greenhouse gases, has not submitted an aggressive climate plan but claims it will produce net zero carbon emissions by 2050, matching U.S. and E.U. targets. These promises, which are not binding but aspirational, are known as ""nationally determined contributions"" or NDCs. There is no enforcement or penalty for failing to meet them and so far, based on the pledges following the Paris Agreement of 2015, collectively the world will fall short.  Because of a ""commitment gap"" between what countries say and what they do  the planet is on track to heat roughly 2.7 Celsius (above pre-industrial times). The U.N. says world leaders need to cut emissions five to seven times faster than currently pledged to avert disaster.  Its possible to limit global warming to 2.2 Celsius by 2100 if countries all live up to their Glasgow pledges. If they only meet targets agreed to in Paris, temperatures will rise 3.2 degrees. Aside from the dueling pledges and carbon shaming, watch for the fight between developed nations like the U.S. and those in the E.U. versus China, India and others where hundreds of millions still dont have electricity.  Developing nations argue the industrial giants of the West polluted the world and now they are being asked to pay for it  with equal cuts despite a much lower standard of living. The G20 (a group of 19 countries and the EU) account for 78% of all emissions. Countries vulnerable to climate change want $100 billion to help handle the natural disasters developed countries caused  heat waves, crop shortages, hurricanes and wildfires.  Climate optimists look to several fronts: Market forces have reduced the price of wind and solar; the cost of battery storage is falling; the adoption of electric cars is quickly growing; and the worlds seven largest economies have agreed to stop financially supporting new coal projects overseas.  Though often condemned for generating the second-highest greenhouse gases per capita after Canada, the U.S. actually reduced its emissions faster than any other nation in the last decade, followed by Japan.",01/11/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/world-leaders-drastic-cuts-emissions-un-climate-conference
Jeff Bezos flies gas-guzzling private jet to Glasgow climate change summit,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos flew his private jet to Glasgow, Scotland, for a United Nations summit aimed at cutting global greenhouse gas emissions, photos obtained by Fox News reveal.  Scores of high-rollers from around the world took private planes into Glasgow over the weekend for the COP26 summit, including Bezos, who has repeatedly claimed climate change is the ""biggest threat"" to the planet.  JOHN KERRY FAMILY PRIVATE JET ALREADY EMITTED ESTIMATED 30 TIMES MORE CARBON IN 2021 THAN AVERAGE VEHICLE DOES IN YEAR  Bezos's jet has been valued in the neighborhood of $65 million.  The Amazon founder also met with Charles, Prince of Wales, on Sunday to discuss the importance of fighting climate change.  ""The Prince of Wales has been involved in fighting climate change and protecting our beautiful world far longer than most,"" Bezos tweeted. ""We had a chance to discuss these important issues on the eve of #COP26  looking for solutions to heal our world, and how the @BezosEarthFund can help,"" he added. Critics on social media assailed summit attendees for choosing to utilize private jets for traveling to a climate event.  Bezos is far from the only climate hawk to indulge in private airfare.    President Biden's climate czar, John Kerry, has a family jet despite the fact that such planes are notoriously bad for the environment.  Kerry even took a private jet to Iceland in 2019 to receive the Arctic Circle award for climate leadership.  Kerry defended his high-pollution ride at the time, calling it ""the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle"" in an interview obtained by Fox News.

Biden appears to fall asleep during climate speech despite claiming it's 'greatest threat' to US security,"Presidents  theyre just like us: Social media erupted on Monday when a viral video appeared to show President Biden dozing off during opening speeches at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.  The 78-year-old Biden  who warned military service members this summer that top Pentagon officials consider climate change to be the ""greatest threat"" to Americas national security in the coming years  sat with his arms crossed, appearing to drift in and out of sleep, in video shared by Washington Post reporter Zach Purser Brown.  BIDEN SENDS ARMY OF AIDES, CABINET MEMBERS TO GLASGOW CLIMATE SUMMIT AMID MAJOR PROBLEMS AT HOME ""Biden appears to fall asleep during COP26 opening speeches,"" Purser Brown wrote to caption a video that showed Biden closing his eyes for extended periods of time before an aide approached him with some type of message. Biden was also seen wiping his eyes and the video quickly went viral, with many mocking the president for appearing to take a quick nap.  Former President Trump has long referred to his political rival as ""Sleepy Joe"" and Mondays video presumably wont help make that nickname go away anytime soon. However, many conservatives joked that Biden nodding off during the climate conference was the most relatable thing hes done as president. The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis responded, ""Can you blame him?""   BIDEN APPEARS TO USE PREPARED LIST OF REPORTERS AFTER G20 SUMMIT IN ROME: 'I'M TOLD WE SHOULD START WITH AP' A HuffPost reporter noted that the video was taken during a speech on climate's impact on disabled people. Many others joked that they would fall asleep, too, but they're not the president of the United States.  ""Holy s--t it looks like Biden fell asleep at the climate thing and an aide had to hustle over to wake him up,"" popular Twitter account Comfortably Smug observed. Rep. Ralph Norman joked, ""Sweet dreams, Mr. President.""  ""Joe Biden... Wake up,"" political pundit Stephen L. Miller responded.  Many others took to Twitter with thoughts on the footage:  Bidens apparent nap came after he was mocked over the weekend for appearing to call on a pre-approved list of reporters after meeting with the press following the G-20 summit in Rome.  On Sunday, Biden discussed meeting with other world leaders in Rome to enact climate change initiatives. After his talk, he opened the floor to questions but admitted that he was told to start with the Associated Press.  ""And now Im happy to take some questions. And Im told I should start with AP, Zeke Miller,"" Biden said. Biden has previously alluded to the idea that he had a list of pre-approved reporters to call on back multiple times, including in June following his Geneva visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Ill take your questions, and as usual, folks, they gave me a list of the people Im going to call on,"" Biden told the press.

Nigel Farage blasts 'ineffectual' Biden on climate change hypocrisy: It's 'complete madness',"Former Brexit party leader Nigel Farage blasted President Biden's ""hypocritical"" stance on climate change, arguing it is ""complete madness"" to endorse cheap fossil fuel energy production abroad while promoting more expensive green energy sources domestically. Farage joined ""Fox &amp; Friends First"" on Monday to discuss the matter, after Biden touted a climate agreement between the U.S. and the EU at the G20 Summit in Rome. BIDEN APOLOGIZES FOR BEING LATE TO G20 PRESS CONFERENCE: WE WERE PLAYING WITH ELEVATORS NIGEL FARAGE: Absolutely, and that's the same phenomenon that we've been through, don't produce anything at home, have it all done by Russia and other countries like that. I mean, it's complete madness. It's totally hypocritical... China's not going. Russia's not going. India, well, Modi is going, but I think very reluctant given income per head to change much in terms of coal use in India. So you basically got about 40% of the world's outputters of CO2, who are not going to budge an inch. And the rest of us... are supposed to have expensive energy in return. It doesn't make sense.  ... I think the truth of it is that ever since the Afghanistan withdrawal, done without any consultation with your long-term allies, America's reputation is frankly down the tubes. And I think Biden looks posturing, ineffectual, and I'm sure Boris Johnson, who's chairing this, is pleased that Biden's there because he's gone absolutely crazy on this green agenda.  ... What is the point of us closing down industries, putting out everyone's fuel bills at home if India, China and Russia aren't going to play the game? It is ludicrous.

NASA study: Climate change impact on world's crops expected within next decade,"Climate change may impact the production of corn (maize) and wheat as early as 2030, according to NASA researchers.  A new study from the agency published in the journal Nature Food said that under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario, maize crop yields are projected to decline by 24% and wheat could potentially see a growth of about 17%. NASA used advanced climate and agriculture modeling to find the change in yields due to projected increases in temperatures, rainfall pattern shifts and elevated surface carbon dioxide concentrations from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. WITH COP26 CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE UNDERWAY, WORLD LEADERS LOOK TOWARD DRASTIC CUTS IN EMISSIONS The team of scientists used the climate model simulations from the international Climate Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 6 (CMIP6). They also used the simulations as inputs for Columbia Unversity's Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) 12 state-of-the-art global crop models. Each of the five CMIP6 climate models used for this study runs its own response of Earths atmosphere to greenhouse gas emission scenarios through the year 2100 and the MgMIP crop models simulate on a large scale how crops grow and respond to environmental conditions. In all, NASA created about 240 global climate-crop model simulations for each crop.  The researchers examined changes to long-term average crop yields and introduced a new estimate for when climate change impacts will emerge, finding that soybeans and rice projections showed a decline in some regions, though global models differed. Impacts on corn and wheat, however, were much clearer, as most of the models indicated similar outcomes.  ""North and Central America, West Africa, Central Asia, Brazil and China will potentially see their maize yields decline in the coming years and beyond as average temperatures rise across these breadbasket regions, putting more stress on the plants,"" NASA wrote Monday in an accompanying news release. ""Wheat, which grows best in temperate climates, may see a broader area where it can be grown as temperatures rise, including the Northern United States and Canada, North China Plains, Central Asia, Southern Australia and East Africa, but these gains may level off mid-century."" AL GORE: 'TIME TO SAY GOODBYE TO COAL, OIL AND GAS WORLDWIDE' In addition to temperature shifts, higher levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere will have a positive effect on photosynthesis and water retention and crop yields  though often at a cost to nutrition. This will happen more so for wheat than maize. The rising temperatures  as well as droughts and heat waves  affect the length of growing seasons and accelerate crop maturity. Crippling drought and record-breaking temperatures parched the West this summer and scientists say climate change will continue to make conditions more extreme and destructive in coming years. In a United Nations report released in August, climate experts warned that the Earth is getting so hot that temperatures in about a decade will probably blow past a level of warming that world leaders have sought to prevent, calling it a ""code red for humanity.""   And the U.N. calculated this week that, between now and 2030, the world will emit up to 31 billion U.S. tons of greenhouse gases beyond the amount that would keep the planet at or below the most stringent limit set in the 2015 Paris climate accord.  In addition to contributing to respiratory disease from air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions trap heat, warming the atmosphere. Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, have fundamentally increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in Earths atmosphere.  ""We did not expect to see such a fundamental shift, as compared to crop yield projections from the previous generation of climate and crop models conducted in 2014,"" lead author Jonas Jagermeyr, a crop modeler and climate scientist at NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and The Earth Institute at Columbia University, said in a statement. The projected maize response was surprisingly large and negative, he said. ""A 20% decrease from current production levels could have severe implications worldwide."" ""Even under optimistic climate change scenarios, where societies enact ambitious efforts to limit global temperature rise, global agriculture is facing a new climate reality,"" he added. ""And with the interconnectedness of the global food system, impacts in even one regions breadbasket will be felt worldwide.""

Climate change: UK calls on private sector to make big investments to save the planet,"Britain called Wednesday for the world's financial industry to channel its vast funds toward greener investments to ensure that global efforts to curb global warming succeed.  Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said that while the U.K. government is providing fresh financing to help poor countries cope with climate change, ""public investment alone isnt enough.""  Speaking at the U.N. climate summit in the Scottish city of Glasgow, Sunak said U.K. financial institutions and publicly traded companies will be required to publish plans detailing how green their investments and their own businesses are  in order to ensure they're actually contributing to reductions in global warming.  NASA STUDY: CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ON WORLDS CROPS EXPECTED WITHIN NEXT DECADE  As home to the City of London, one of the worlds major financial centers, the U.K. ""has a responsibility to lead the way"" in financing those and other efforts to fight global warming, said Sunak.  The push for greener investments also represents a major opportunity. The measure is part of a plan that aims to create ""the worlds first net-zero aligned financial center"" to meet the demands of those seeking to profit from the drive toward a low-carbon economy, Sunak said.  Scores of countries, including Britain, have announced plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions to ""net zero"" in coming decades to help curb manmade climate change.  Cities, states and companies have also embraced the goal, which means limiting greenhouse gas emissions to the amount that can be absorbed again through natural or artificial means. Experts caution that there are various ways to calculate ""net zero""  and deciding on one standard definition is one of the big challenges going forward.  Sunak called for a ""historic wall of capital"" to help countries, companies and cities meet their net-zero goals  but poor nations have noted angrily that Britain and other wealthy countries failed to meet their commitment to provide $100 billion a year to finance climate-related projects in the developing world by 2020.  That target is now expected to be met in 2023.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen described climate change as both a huge financial challenge, with a price tag of $100 trillion, and ""the greatest economic opportunity of our time.""    ""Many renewables are now cheaper than carbon-based fuel alternatives and have lower long-term operating costs,"" she said. ""In many cases, it's simply cost effective to go green.""  U.S. President Biden issued an executive order earlier this year aimed at requiring companies to disclose climate-related financial risks.",03/11/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/world/global-warming-uk-calls-private-sector-big-investments-save-planet

"Obama tells young people at climate change summit: 'Vote like your life depends on it, because it does'","Former President Barack Obama issued a dire warning to young people during his speech at the international climate change summit in Glasgow, urging them to ""vote like your life depends on it, because it does."" Obama gave a lengthy speech Monday morning stressing the urgency of addressing climate change and blasting his successor, former President Donald Trump, for ushering in ""four years of active hostility"" toward climate science in the United States. He called on young people to ""stay angry"" about climate inaction and to channel that anger toward pressuring lawmakers and governments to enact change. BIDEN FAILS TO ACHIEVE UNITY ON CLIMATE AS CHINA, RUSSIA AVOID COP26 SUMMIT ""Vote like your life depends on it, because it does,"" he declared. ""We can't afford anybody on the sidelines,"" he said. ""I recognize we're living in a moment. When international cooperation has waned. A moment of greater geopolitical tension and stress. In part because of the pandemic, in part because of the rise of nationalism and tribal impulses around the world. And yes, in part because of a lack of leadership on America's part for four years on a host of multilateral issues.  ""Joe Biden wants to do even more,"" he continued. ""He's constrained by the absence of a robust majority that's needed to make that happen. Both of us have been constrained in large part by the fact that one of our two major parties has decided not only to sit on the sidelines, but express active hostility toward climate science and make climate change a partisan issue. ... I welcome any faction within the Republican Party in the United States that takes climate change seriously."" Obama said its not enough to criticize people who dont agree as ignorant but to reach out and listen to their concerns about climate change policy. ""To change the minds of those fellow citizens in our respective countries, we have to do a little more listening,"" he said. ""We can't just yell at them or say they're ignorant. We can't just tweet at them. It's not enough to inconvenience them through blocking traffic in a protest. We actually have to listen to their objections and understand the reluctance of some ordinary people.""  Obama's speech came a week after President Biden's appearance at the COP26 summit, during which he apologized to fellow world leaders for the Trump administration's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. Obama also slammed the U.S. pullout in his speech, saying, ""I wasnt real happy about that.""",08/11/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-young-people-climate-change-vote-life-depends-on-it
Pentagon says China and climate change 'equally important' national security threats,"The Pentagon said Wednesday it considers China and climate change to be ""equally important"" national security threats facing the U.S. Department of Defense.  ""Both are equally important,"" press secretary John Kirby told Fox News. ""Both are challenges that the secretary wants the senior leadership at the Pentagon to be focused on, as well as many others too. ""I think we get paid to examine all the threats to our national security. And I don't know that it does anybody good to put some sort of relative analysis assessment on that,"" he said when Fox News Lucas Tomlinson asked whether China or the climate was a bigger threat to the U.S. PELOSI AGREES WITH COMMENT THAT US MILITARY A 'LARGER POLLUTER THAN 140 COUNTRIES COMBINED' ""You've heard the secretary talk about the climate as a real and existential national security threat,"" he continued. ""And it is  not just to the United States, but to countries all over the world."" Kirbys comments came just one day after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi conceded that the U.S. military is ""a larger polluter than 140 countries combined,"" during her trip to Scotland for the United Nations Climate Summit.  ""We have been nothing but honest about the fact that we are the largest emitter here, in the federal government,"" Kirby said ""We know that. And that's...one of the reasons why we're taking the climate crisis so very seriously, because we are a contributor to those emissions and we know that."" Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks on Tuesday touted the militarys plan to launch a fleet of electric vehicles as part of President Bidens push to counter climate change.  Tactical vehicles will be the first to become hybrid, to ease the reliable transition between fully electric and fossil fuel-reliant vehicles.  PENTAGON, CONGRESS INCREASINGLY WORRIED ABOUT THE RISE OF CHINESE MILITARY Roughly 170,000 nontactical cars and trucks used on bases will become fully electric, though it is unclear when this goal will be achieved. While speaking to the automobile industry in Detroit, Hicks said the U.S. is looking to have the DOD reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The deputy defense secretary said as the administration looks to relinquish its reliance on fossil fuels, it will need to beef up its supply chains for lithium batteries.  ""Batteries are also essential to thousands of military systems, from handheld radios to unmanned submersibles, and to future capabilities like lasers, directed energy weapons, and hybrid electric tactical vehicles,"" she explained. Hicks said the U.S. is working to shore up its domestic supply of lithium batteries to take on not just climate change, but China.    ""It is estimated [that] investments committed to the global lithium-ion battery supply chain are approaching a trillion dollars,"" she continued. ""The problem, however, is that China presently dominates that supply chain.""  Defense officials have contested climate change poses a security threat to not only U.S. military facilities today, but to the future of the institution as it addresses prolonged instability worldwide.  ""Every dollar we spend recovering from the effects of climate change is one dollar the department is not investing to meet other priorities,"" Hicks said.

"Fourth-generation dairy farmer warns economic woes, climate change regulations could end family farms","A fourth-generation dairy farmer warned that climate change-related regulations and a slew of economic woes could signal the end for her family's way of life after nearly a century. ""We've been attacked in the dairy industry for a while now,"" Stephanie Nash told Fox News. ""Instead of educating people through the farmer, we're educating them through people that have never farmed and we're killing off our family farmers."" Rising costs, labor and supply shortages and little support  in addition to climate change and conservation regulations  are all major obstacles threatening the Nash family, which has been in the dairy farming business for 92 years. Stephanie, 28, and her father, Steven Nash, moved their almost century-old dairy farm from California's San Joaquin Valley to Tennessee in 2014 to escape the Golden State's strict farming regulations and high cost of doing business. SENATE REPUBLICANS TO SOUND ALARM ON RISING COST OF THANKSGIVING AMID INFLATION, SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS ""They regulate us on every step we make,"" Stephanie recalled from their time in California. ""Were constantly looked at, constantly manipulated and told what to do, and farmers, especially my dads age and older, they dont want to be told how to farm."" ""Water rights, milk prices, feed prices, regulations on climate change ... we had to fight with Los Angeles and San Francisco on every issue,"" she added.  Her father agreed, saying the state took ""an adversarial approach"" when it came to dealing with farmers.   ""They weren't worried about farmers there,"" Steven, 61, told Fox News. California is the largest agricultural state in the U.S., growing roughly 40% of the country's vegetables, fruit and nuts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It is also the biggest producer of dairy and wine. Prone to drought, the state has implemented a state law limiting farmers access to water.  While the move to Tennessee saved the family from bankruptcy, the Nashes are concerned with some rhetoric and proposed legislation coming from Washington, D.C., surrounding agriculture.  ""Theyre making all these bills and regulations, and people living in the city actually believe it instead of believing in your farmers that are actually putting food on the table for you,"" said Stephanie, who is also a singer-songwriter and agricultural activist. She hopes her advocacy, the Nash Creamery and their new cheese plant will be enough to keep the family business afloat.  ""That's what everybody prays for,"" Stephanie told Fox News. ""We pray for rain, we pray for fair prices and we pray for regulations that are not going to kill off our industry."" WATCH FULL VIDEO: Stevens grandfather, Wallace Nash, began milking cows in central California in 1929. A decade later, Stevens father, Howard, took over the farm and grew the operation from 30 to 200 cows.  In 1980, Howard became ill, and 20-year-old Steven stepped in and took over the farm's daily operations. Over the next 40 years, the herd expanded from 200 to over 1,200 cows.  ""Dairys just something Ive always liked,"" Steven told Fox News. ""I really enjoy seeing a well-bred cow ... that walks fluidly, has a nice udder and produces lots of milk. Thats my gratification.""  The Nashes milk their cows twice a day, grow their own feed and recently opened a creamery and a cheese plant to help supplement costs.  In February, the USDA forecast the 2020 median farm household income at a loss of $1,840. On average, nearly 90% of a family farm's income is supplied by another source of income or employment. Small dairy farms are among the least sustainable type of farm today as they grapple with declining demand for cow's milk and consolidation in their industry, resulting in much larger but fewer farms, according to the USDA. Since 2003, the U.S. has lost more than half of its licensed dairy operations, down to under 32,000 operations. ""The last farm bill, the dairy policy was put together without a lot of input from farmers,"" Steven said of the 2018 Agricultural Improvement Act.  ""They changed our pricing mechanism, and what thats done is taken nearly a billion dollars out of the dairy industry, out of the farming sector, out of my segment, and moved it to processors and other people in the industry before it gets to the grocery store,"" he continued.  At the urging of dairy processors, the 2018 farm bill changed an industry formula that determines the price of fluid milk under the Federal Milk Marketing Order system.  ""The change contributed to substantial market volatility last year and has led to an estimated $750 million in losses for farmers compared to the previous Class I formula,"" the National Milk Producers Federation said in an October statement. ""Without a fix, dairy farmers will permanently bear unfair and unnecessary price risk compared to processors during times of unusual market volatility."" Steven told Fox News: ""It's a lot of money to lose. That has been very difficult for a lot of people, myself included."" As a result of this formula change, price increases in grocery stores doesn't mean the farmer sees an increase on their end. Additionally, farmers face rising costs on gas and energy, labor shortages, high feed expenses and supply chain issues. ""We are a capital-intensive business,"" Steven said. ""We live and die on feed costs."" He said those account for 55% of the farms expenses.  ""Were not like other businesses where we can just cut back,"" he said. ""Cows got to be fed every day, right?"" He added that the labor shortage and supply chain delays were also critical issues. ""We're time sensitive,"" he said. ""We can miss our window of opportunity just because of a bearing or a tire."" The National Milk Producers Federation estimated that shipping disruptions cost the U.S. dairy industry nearly $1 billion during the first half of the year from higher shipping and inventory costs, lost export volume and price deterioration. Stephanie often posts on TikTok and YouTube to voice her concerns for struggling farmers and to educate people on how some legislative bills affect the agriculture industry. ""You look at big seed companies, you look at the ethanol plants, you look at all these big investors, again, going back to politicians, what are they investing in?"" she said. ""Why are they putting all this funding into certain areas? Because they're going to make more money."" ""The farmer is going to be dead, and the family farms are going to be gone, and they're going to continue to get richer off of stuff like plant-based and climate change,"" Stephanie continued.  RISING INFLATION SEES MAINE, NEW ENGLANDERS BLAST BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND RICH PEOPLE TRYING TO GET RICHER Stephanie often warns her followers about policy threats to the agriculture industry, like President Bidens 30 by 30 plan, a federal push to conserve 30% of the nation's lands and waters by 2030.  Similarly, the departments of the Interior, Agriculture and Commerce alongside the White House Council on Environmental Quality released Conserving and Restoring America the Beautiful, a preliminary report regarding conservation. It states that ""federal agencies can and should advance conservation by supporting programs that incentivize voluntary conservation efforts and provide new sources of income for American farmers, ranchers, and forest stewards."" Stephanie told Fox News: ""There's a lot of money in Washington, D.C., and I'm really scared that money is going towards persuading people in the USDA to go plant-based, to go climate change, to fund all of this other stuff ... so corporate and big- investor farm systems continue to farm and gain access to our pricing in the grocery store.""  Steven, who hopes to pass on the farm to his daughter one day, said Nash Farms received aid from the federal government to help with coronavirus-related issues.  ""While we use them, we dont like them,"" he said of the farmers aid programs. ""I want a fair price that represents the work that we do."" ""We have a great product.,"" Steven continued. ""Why does the government got to support us because we can't make it on our own? That's that's the fundamental issue here."" Dairy farmers have received more than $3 billion, or about $1 of every $8, of the $24.4 billion disbursed to farmers and ranchers since COVID-19 payments began in May 2020, according to the USDA. ""We are in a place that we could go either way,"" Steven said of his farms financial stability. ""I've been there many times before, so we'll just have to see what the next few months bring.""",28/11/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/us/dairy-farmer-climate-change-regulations-family-farms
Kamala Harris says new space policy will focus on climate change,"Vice President Kamala Harris announced during her first National Space Council meeting Wednesday that the Biden administrations new space policy will make the fight against climate change a top priority. Harris, who chairs the council, stressed the importance of improving the gathering and dissemination of satellite technology that is used to track and predict extreme weather on Earth. BIDEN ADMIN TO STRENGTHEN ABILITY TO DETECT 'HOSTILE ACTS' IN SPACE WITH NEW POLICY FRAMEWORK ""Just think, these satellites provide real-time images of the landscape of our nation as natural disasters increase in frequency and ferocity around our country,"" she said. ""These images are being used by first responders. These images are being used by farmers to assess their crops as drought and heat threatens their livelihood, threatens our ability to produce food as a nation, and by scientists who are working to combat the climate crisis head on.  ""Today, this council will commit to make this data more accessible to more people, and we will expand our global partnerships to increase the data we are able to collect,"" she said. The White House issued a ""Space Priorities Framework"" earlier Wednesday that said the U.S., through collaboration between the public, private and philanthropic sectors, will ""accelerate the development and use of Earth observation to support climate change mitigation and adaptation.""  The climate change issue is among three top priorities that the council will tackle under Harris leadership. The other two include ""promoting rules and norms"" that govern space activities around the globe and building up the U.S. workforce in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), Harris said. The council is a Cabinet-level body that was revived under the Trump administration in 2017 after a more than two-decade hiatus. The new framework keeps many of the priorities set by the Trump administration but adds the climate change and STEM initiatives.",01/12/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-space-policy-climate-change
"'Earth's Black Box' installation will record climate change data for future generations, creators say","A steel structure known as ""Earths Black Box"" will soon record rising temperature trends as well as other information related to climate change from a remote Australian island.  The ""black box,"" similar to one on a plane, will document events that can contribute to climate change like pollution and actions by politicians.  The companys website says its purpose is to give an ""unbiased account of the events that led to the demise of the planet, hold accountability for future generations, and inspire urgent action."" ""How the story ends is completely up to us,"" the website says.  ""If civilization does crash, this box will survive with a completely objective data story,"" said Jim Curtis, an advertising executive who is involved with the project, according to The New York Times.  Australian advertising company Clemenger BBDO is collaborating on the project with researchers from Tasmania University as well as others, according to ABC News Australia.  He said he hopes the black box never has to be opened. ""Im on the plane; I dont want it to crash,"" he said. ""I really hope that its not too late."" The box, which will be 33 feet long, is being built in Tasmania and is expected to be completed sometime next year.  The technology inside its 3-inch steel walls will have the ability to collect information for the next 50 years, according to the Times.  As well as temperature changes, it will record ocean acidification, CO2 in the atmosphere, energy consumption, military spending and news events related to climate change, such as climate summits, by scanning the internet, according to ABC.  Some critics have questioned the boxs efficacy.  ""Its not easily accessible or comprehensible to most people,"" Yale historian Daniel Kevles said, according to the Times. Though it may have some merit as a document for the future, he added, ""Im not all that impressed with regard to its consequential impact for warning us."" Its also unclear what future generations would make of the box or how they would retrieve its data.   ""Obviously it's really a powerful concept when you say to someone, 'Earth's got a black box'. Because they're like, 'Why does it need a black box?'"" Curtis added, according to the Times. ""But first and foremost, it's a tool.""",10/12/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/world/earths-black-box-installation-will-record-climate-change-data-for-future-generations-creators-say
Liberals use deadly tornados to attack Republicans on climate change,"Several liberals on Twitter, including politicians and celebrities, pointed the finger at climate change and Republicans following devastating tornados in western Kentucky that killed at least 70 people. Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell used the tragedy to take a shot at Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who represents Kentucky, accusing him of not caring about Americans who are in need. KENTUCKY TORNADO DEATH TOLL WILL EXCEED 70, GOVERNOR WARNS ""We should do all we can to help our Kentucky neighbors. God be with them  they are hurting,"" Swalwell tweeted. ""But do not for one second forget that @RandPaul has voted against helping most Americans most times theyre in need."" Noel Scovell, a former writer and producer for Late Night With David Letterman, also blamed Paul and fellow Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who also represents Kentucky. ""Sorry Kentucky,"" Scovell tweeted. ""Maybe if your 2 senators hadn't spent decades blocking legislation to reduce climate change, you wouldn't be suffering from climate disasters. If it's any consolation, McConnell and Rand have f'ed over all of us, too."" BIDEN TO VISIT KENTUCKY TORNADO DEVASTATION AS LONG AS HE WON'T 'GET IN THE WAY' Former ESPN host Jemele Hill encouraged Democrats to use the tornado as an opportunity to damage Sen. Paul politically. ""We know @RandPaul is a heartless hypocrite,"" Hill tweeted. ""The people in Kentucky deserve the relief regardless of their buffoonish leadership, but if the Dems dont use this against him and his party in the future, it is a missed opportunity."" President Biden suggested climate change was to blame for the tragedy saying, """"All I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impacts as a consequence of the warming of the planet and climate change,"" Biden said.  Actor Mark Ruffalo also placed blame for the tornado at the feet of climate change. ""This is what #ClimateCatastrophe looks like,"" Ruffalo tweeted. ""Its only going to get worse from here. Now is time to fight for our suffering and despairing youth."" Rachel Vindman, co-host of the Suburban Women Problem and wife of retired United States Army lieutenant colonel Alexander Vindman, called the tornados a ""direct result of climate change.  ""Climate Change: What does it look like?"" Vindman asked. ""This is absolutely heartbreaking &amp; it's a direct result of climate change. Believe me, I know it's tempting to scream, yell &amp; question why people are so slow to accept reality but we must have conversations w/ skeptics."" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear stated during a 5 a.m. press conference that a single tornado tore across Western Kentucky in a sustained way for more than 200 miles  and at least four different tornadoes struck the state during the night. In addition, he said the death toll could reach between 70 and 100 dead, across five or more counties. ""This morning, I was briefed on the devastating tornadoes across the central U.S. To lose a loved one in a storm like this is an unimaginable tragedy,"" President Biden tweeted.

FEMA administrator blames climate change for deadly tornado outbreak,"Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell laid blame on climate change for the deadly tornado outbreak over the weekend, claiming such disasters will be the ""new normal"" from now on. ""This is going to be our new normal,"" Criswell said during an appearance on CNN Sunday. ""The effects we are seeing of climate change are the crisis of our generation,"" Criswell said. ""We're taking a lot of efforts at FEMA to work with communities to help reduce the impacts that we're seeing from these severe weather events and help to develop system-wide projects that can help protect communities."" FEMA IN LIFE-SAVING, SUSTAINING MODE COMBING FOR SURVIVORS IN TORNADO DEVASTATION  Criswell's comments come after a tornado outbreak terrorized parts of the Midwest on Friday and Saturday, with more than 100 people feared dead and leaving thousands without power throughout much of Kentucky, Illinois, and Arkansas. ""This is Kentuckys most devastating tornado event in our history,"" Kentucky Gov. Andrew Beshear said at an event Sunday. ""Nothing that was standing in the direct line of this tornado is still standing."" The nation's top emergency management official said such a severe and sustained outbreak of deadly storms this late in the year is ""unprecedented,"" but she noted that FEMA is doing everything it can to help people impacted by the storms.  ""I think there is still hope, right?"" she said. ""We sent one of our federal urban search and rescue teams down to Kentucky. They arrived yesterday. They'll be able to assist the localities with their ongoing rescue efforts. I think there is still hope, and we should continue to try to find as many people as we can."" Criswell's comments come after President Biden said it was too early to tell whether climate change could have played a role in the outbreak, saying he would have the Environmental Protection Agency assess the possibility.",12/12/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/us/fema-administrator-blames-climate-change-for-deadly-tornado-outbreak
"LA Times flamed for advocating closure of California nuclear power plant, citing climate change fight","Critics flamed the Los Angeles Times editorial board over the weekend for arguing that California's last remaining nuclear power plant needed to be closed in the name of doing even more to fight climate change.  In a Sunday editorial, the board criticized those advocating for the plant to remain open despite the plant operator's 2018 decision to shut down, and implored California's state government to get other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, in place to prevent an increase in the use of natural gas following the plant's closure. ""California is approaching an energy crossroads. In three years, its last nuclear plant will begin to power down and the state will lose its largest single source of emissions-free electricity,"" the board wrote. ""If [regulators] dont move more quickly to replace its electricity with renewable energy from wind, solar and geothermal, the void will almost certainly be filled by burning more natural gas."" FEMA ADMINISTRATOR BLAMES CLIMATE CHANGE FOR DEADLY TORNADO OUTBREAK The board argued the state couldn't allow the plant's retirement to prolong reliance on natural gas or increase emissions, and it claimed that no assurances had yet been made that an uptick in the latter would be avoided.  It noted that those lack of assurances had led to the formation of a campaign to keep the plant open, with such proponents arguing that doing so ""would reduce climate pollution, bolster grid reliability and buy time during a crucial period in the states transition toward solar, wind and other renewable energy sources."" The board added the Biden administration had been receptive to suggestions for California to keep the facility open.  ""But the idea is misguided, and at this point remains largely divorced from reality,"" the board wrote. ""The plants closure should instead serve as an impetus for California do more to accelerate the shift to renewable energy and set a realistic course to meet the states target of getting 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045."" ""Those floating the idea of keeping Diablo Canyon open seem to ignore many practical considerations, including how to address seismic risks, the ecological harm of using seawater for cooling, and what to do with spent nuclear fuel,"" it added.  The board argued that responsibly replacing the plant would require faster deployment of wind and solar energy sources, as well as batteries to store energy and upgrades to transmission lines.  GRETA THUNBERG DERIDES COP26 CLIMATE PACT: BLAH, BLAH, BLAH ""Regulators have had years to prepare for Diablos retirement and should not leave things to chance,"" the board wrote. ""Gov. Gavin Newsom and the incoming PUC president he recently named, Alice Reynolds, need to do more to get renewable energy sources operating as quickly as possible, and should carefully track them and impose requirements that they reduce climate pollution."" ""Its our planet at stake, and Californias leaders must ensure the sunset of nuclear power is not followed by a damaging rise in greenhouse gases,"" it added. Critics took to social media to blast the board, with some arguing that being against nuclear power meant they weren't serious about fighting climate change, and others suggesting that it was denying science to argue against the use of nuclear power to fight climate change. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, argued that there wasn't actually a better way to fight climate change as the board suggested. She stated that California was already having energy shortages, and therefore energy demands would only increase after the plant's closure. She added that ""newer generation small nuclear reactors"" could fill the void. BIDEN USES TORNADO TRAGEDY TO PUSH CLIMATE CHANGE AGENDA, SUGGESTS STORMS ARE CONSEQUENCE OF THE WARMING'  ""The real mystery is why we even acknowledge the scientific opinions of a group of people whose professional qualifications are limited solely to criticizing solutions instead of doing actual work to solve problems,"" another critic wrote.

Douglas Murray scolds Biden and Democrats for politicizing deadly tornado to advance climate change agenda,"Author Douglas Murray accused President Biden on Monday of politicizing the deadly tornadoes to advance his far-left climate agenda as Democrats rushed to cast blame for the devastating storm. ""Natural disasters now are used by Democrats and people on the climate left in particular as just another opportunity to push a particular political ideology,"" Murray told ""Fox News Primetime"" host Will Cain.  BIDEN USES TORNADO TRAGEDY TO PUSH CLIMATE AGENDA While speaking to reporters and virtually assessing the tornado damage from Wilmington, Delaware on Saturday, Biden was asked whether he ""could conclude that these storms and the intensity have to do with climate change."" ""All I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impacts as a consequence of the warming of the planet and climate change,"" Biden said. ""The specific impact on these specific storms, I can't say at this point."" Murray rejected the implied correlation, citing a recent article from the Economist Magazine that proves that the data shows ""no significant increase no change in the number of tornadoes affecting the United States in recent decades."" ""The Democrats never want to dwell on this because they have forgotten that there have always been throughout human history been what we used to call natural disasters,"" Murray said.   In November, Biden claimed climate change is ""an existential threat to human existence as we know it"" at the United Nations' COP26 conference and apologized for former President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. ""I can save President Biden the effort of having to ask the so-called experts on this,"" Murray responded, emphasizing that ""there is abundant evidence that there has been no change in the frequency of tornadoes in the United States of America in recent decades.""",13/12/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/media/douglas-murray-scolds-biden-and-democrats-politicizing-deadly-tornado-advance-climate-change-agenda
Germany approves $68B to combat climate change,"The German government on Monday approved 60 billion euros ($68 billion) in funding to be used for combating climate change and modernizing the country, a move that the new finance minister described as a ""booster"" for Europe's biggest economy.  The supplementary budget approved by Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Cabinet entails putting the money into a government fund that is being redesigned as a ""climate and transformation fund."" It will be used to finance projects aimed at fighting climate change and improving Germany's infrastructure.  Finance Minister Christian Lindner said in a statement that ""60 billion euros for investments in the future are a booster for the economy,"" which is still recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.  SCHOLZ SUCCEEDS MERKEL AS GERMAN CHANCELLOR, OPENING NEW ERA  Lindner said new borrowing this year will remain at the 240.2 billion euros the previous government already planned.  ""No new debt is being taken on ... we are only using so-far unused credit authorization"" to run up the extra funding, he told reporters.  HILLARY CLINTON JABS DONALD TRUMP ON ANGELA MERKELS LAST DAY: LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD FOR 4 YEARS  Lindner and his pro-business Free Democrats, the smallest of three parties in the center-left Scholz's coalition, have ruled out tax hikes and insist on continuing to observe rules that limit new debt in the future. Those have been suspended during the pandemic.    At the same time, the coalition has ambitious plans to ramp up the use of renewable energy and invest in modernizing digital and other infrastructure in Germany.",13/12/2021,https://www.foxnews.com/world/germany-approves-68-billion-combat-climate-change
Cambridge peer-reviewed study suggests 'authoritarianism' might be necessary to fight climate change,"A study published in a peer-reviewed academic journal suggests that ""authoritarianism"" could be necessary to fight against climate change. The study, published in Cambridge Universitys American Political Science Review and first reported by the Foundation For Economic Education, leads with a question of ""is authoritarian power ever legitimate?"" before the author outlines how it could be when combating climate change. LA TIMES FLAMED FOR ADVOCATING CLOSURE OF CALIFORNIA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, CITING CLIMATE CHANGE FIGHT ""While, under normal conditions, maintaining democracy and rights is typically compatible with guaranteeing safety, in emergency situations, conflicts between these two aspects of legitimacy can and often do arise,"" assistant professor of political theory at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile Ross Mittiga writes in the studys abstract. ""A salient example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, during which severe limitations on free movement and association have become legitimate techniques of government. Climate change poses an even graver threat to public safety. Consequently, I argue, legitimacy may require a similarly authoritarian approach."" The abstract concludes, ""While unsettling, this suggests the political importance of climate action. For if we wish to avoid legitimating authoritarian power, we must act to prevent crises from arising that can only be resolved by such means."" AUSTIN'S DEFUNDED POLICE NO LONGER HAVE THE STAFF TO MONITOR SEX OFFENDERS The study states that it is ""ultimately an empirical question whether authoritarian governance is better able to realize desired environmental outcomes and, if so, why and to what extent."" The study drew criticism on Twitter, most notably from Alexander Wuttke, political psychology professor at the University of Mannheim, who called the study ""disturbing."" ""In my reading, it explicitly argues that we must put climate action over democracy and adopt authoritarian governance if democracies fail to act on climate change,"" Wuttke tweeted.  Mittiga responded to the criticism with a lengthy Twitter thread writing that his paper is ""meant to be a warning about the threats climate change poses to democratic governance and human rights."" ""In other words, I argue that we should all be advocating for rapid and extensive climate action, *precisely for the sake of preserving democracy and human rights*, which face their biggest threats in the context of security emergencies, like climate change,"" Mittiga adds.

"Germany faces 'gigantic task' in achieving climate change goals, new climate minister says","Germany's new climate minister said Tuesday that the country faces a ""gigantic"" task if it wants to achieve its goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring sufficient energy for its energy-hungry industry.  Robert Habeck, a member of the environmentalist Greens, told reporters in Berlin that Germany is on track to halve its emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels  far off the government's target of 65%.  Pandemic-related effects that allowed Germany to achieve its interim goal of a 40% reduction by 2020 fell away last year, resulting in a renewed rise in emissions for 2021.  COVID-19: GERMANY TO TIGHTEN RESTAURANT RULES WHILE CUTTING QUARANTINE TIME   One reason for Germany's rising emissions is the decision to switch off all nuclear power plants by the end of this year, increasing reliance on coal-fired power plants.  The government plans to phase out coal power ""ideally"" by 2030 as well, filling the gap with less polluting natural gas until enough renewable energy is available to meet the demands of Europe's biggest economy.  Renewable sources such as solar and wind power currently provide about 43% of Germany's electricity, but that share needs to almost double to 80% by 2030, Habeck said. He noted that electricity consumption over that period is projected to increase significantly as people switch from combustion engine vehicles to electric cars, and heating homes with oil to electricity-powered heat pumps.  ""You can see the task is big, gigantic,"" Habeck said.  The new center-left government that took power in Germany last month plans to put forward two packages of legislation this spring and summer that include revising subsidies for renewable energy, requiring solar panels on new buildings and adjusting the rules on where wind turbines can be erected.  Habeck said he expects a ""huge political debate"" over the measures, but insisted that Germany can't afford to frame it as a tradeoff between preserving the natural landscape, protecting the economy or reducing emissions. Last year's deadly flash floods in western Germany, which killed some 200 people and devastated entire villages, had shown one could happen without the others, he said.  A report by reinsurance company Munich Re this week found the floods in July were the costliest natural disaster ever recorded in Europe.  Economists cautiously welcomed Habeck's plans, but said Germany should do more to expand Europe's carbon trading system to cover the transport and heating sectors.  Some environmental groups have reacted angrily to draft European Union plans that would allow nuclear and gas power plants to be labeled ""sustainable."" The proposal is seen as a compromise between France, which seeks to expand its use of nuclear power, and Germany, which wants to boost natural gas as a ""bridge technology"" on the way to a carbon-free future.  On Tuesday, a group of activists placed an atomic power plant made of cardboard in front of the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's office and held up banners reading: ""No green stamp for nuclear and gas.""    Habeck said that while he doesn't support the use of nuclear energy, it was up to each European country to decide how it wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to zero.  Habeck also said it was ""logical"" to work on the premise that the amount of carbon dioxide Germany can emit in future is finite. The idea of fixed ""carbon budgets"" is something many countries oppose, but Habeck told The Associated Press that he believes the principle should apply globally.",11/01/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/world/germany-faces-gigantic-task-achieving-climate-change-goals-new-climate-minister
Homeland Security launches 'climate change professionals program' amid historic illegal border crossings surge,"The Department of Homeland Security has announced a ""climate change professionals program"" while the historic number of illegal border crossings continues to increase.

Republicans slam Biden DHS for starting climate change program as border crisis rages,"FIRST ON FOX  Forty House Republicans are pressing the Biden administration over a new climate change program created by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) even as that agency struggles to handle the southern border crisis.  Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, a co-chairman of the House Border Security Caucus, is leading that group, which sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Thursday.  The letter lambastes the secretary for alleged ""dereliction of duty"" for not focusing on DHS's ""intended mission by securing the border and resuming interior enforcement.""  ""Given that we had a record-breaking two million illegal crossings in 2021, we are deeply concerned that this initiative is a misuse of taxpayer dollars, a paltry attempt to distract the American people from your failure to secure the border, and a dangerous reorientation of the Departments real job: protecting against threats to the Homeland,"" the Republicans say in their letter.  Other notable members who signed the letter are Reps. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, Chip Roy, R-Texas, and others.  MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS INCREASED AGAIN AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER IN DECEMBER: COURT DOCS The DHS program they are referring to is the Climate Change Professionals Program, which the department announced earlier this month. The program falls under the DHS Climate Change Action Group, which Mayorkas created last year.  ""The Climate Change Professionals Program will be instrumental in helping the Department adapt to our changing climate by providing hands-on experience and guidance to young professionals interested in climate adaptation and resilience,"" Mayorkas said of the program. ""This program will develop the next generation of climate experts, improve climate literacy throughout the Department, and help us execute our Climate Action Plan to remain mission-resilient while reducing our own impacts on the environment.""  FOX FOOTAGE SHOWS MASS RELEASE OF SINGLE ADULT MIGRANTS INTO THE US The program will last two years and those who complete it will be eligible for permanent DHS jobs. Its purpose, according to the department, will be to help DHS adapt to climate risks like floods, wildfires, droughts and other extreme weather events.  But the members who signed onto the Babin letter argue it's bogus to call climate change a ""security threat"" when ""data shows that deaths from natural disasters are at their lowest point in 120 years and that weve seen a 92 percent decline in the death toll from natural disasters since its peak in 1920."" ""While we understand the frustration you and the administration must feel knowing that the American people are not buying into your preferred crisis of choice  climate change  we urge you to refocus the work of the Department to its intended mission by securing the border and resuming interior enforcement,"" the letter continues. ""Doing otherwise is a dereliction of duty, and in direct opposition to the oath of office you swore."" BIDEN ADMIN ENROLLED FEWER THAN 300 MIGRANTS IN REMAIN IN MEXICO IN DECEMBER According to the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data provided in the Jan. court 14 filing, there were 178,840 migrant encounters in December, up from 173,620 in November. That in turn was an increase from the 164,753 apprehensions in October. Those numbers are drastically higher than the previous year, when there were 72,113 encounters in November and 73,994 in December.  President Biden assigned Vice President Harris to address the root causes of illegal immigration soon after they were inaugurated. But the crisis continues to rage on with ""numerous"" migrants being released deep into the U.S., including single adults, as authorities struggle to deal with the sheer volume of border-crossers and security measures like the border wall were paused by the president.

Climate scientist tells Joe Rogan he refuses to debate dissenters on climate change,"A climate scientist who formerly worked in the Clinton administration admitted to Joe Rogan that he was unwillling to debate scientists who disagreed with him about climate change.  Andrew Dessler, professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&amp;M University has appeared on MSNBC and CNBC to promote the lefts views on man-made climate change. But the climatologist told Rogan on a February 16 episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"", that there was no debate on ""the fact"" of climate change. MEDIA HYPES CLIMATE DISASTER IF BUILD BACK BETTER FAILS: 'CIVILIZATIONAL' STAKES During the interview, Rogan asked his guest if he had ever ""debated anyone"" over climate change. Dessler stated he did debate a climate skeptic, scientist Richard Lindzen over a decade ago, but it was ""terrible"" and he vowed he would never do it again. ""My feeling is that I wont debate the science. So the science is set,"" he stated. ""The temperature is warming, humans have caused it."" ""Im happy to debate policy, because I think policy needs to be debated,"" he added. PHYSICIST TO TUCKER CARLSON: CLIMATE CHANGE IS 'FICTION OF THE MEDIA' Rogan pushed back on his guest, asking why he was unwilling to debate a scientist who disagreed with him, when it would be ""beneficial"" to the public who doesnt know who to trust on these issues. The podcast host referenced his guest the week prior, Steve Koonin, a physicist who worked in the Obama administration, who says that science on climate change is not settled, and the media exaggerates it. But Dessler claimed it would be too burdensome and time-consuming to ""fact-check"" someone who disagreed with him, in real-time. After Rogan disagreed, saying that there could be clear parameters set for time effectiveness and clarity, Dessler wouldnt budge, saying he would only debate what policy changes to make to fight against man-made climate change.  ""I think you overestimate the ability to settle these issues in a debate,"" Dessler told Rogan. The popular podcast host came under fire recently from the left for allegedly spreading COVID misinformation. Several musicians pulled their music from streaming platform Spotify to pressure the company to take action against Rogan. In response, the podcast giant said he would try to bring on more left-leaning guests as a counterpoint to his other guests and took down seventy episodes of his show that featured controversial guests or the use of a racial slur.  Some belive Rogan shouldn't have issued that statement, which some saw as an apology. Governor Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital, that he shouldnt have apologized to the ""mob."" ""No, he shouldn't have apologized. I mean, you see what happens?

""So, you know, I think hopefully President Putin would realize that in the northern part of his country, they used to live on 66% of the nation that was over frozen land.""  ""Now it's thawing, and his infrastructure is at risk,"" he added. ""And the people of Russia are at risk. And so I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.""

Kerry's made the comments days before Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday by land, air and sea in the largest military attack of one state against another on the European continent since World War II.  The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.   According to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, a Ukrainian transport plane was shot down, killing five soldiers. At least 40 Ukrainian military members are believed to have died as Russia continues to invade the country. Those death estimates are expected to rise.

Kerry's comments came during an appearance Wednesday on BBC Arabic, in which Biden's climate envoy also lamented the potential ""emissions consequences"" from the war in Ukraine and worried the attention of large countries would be ""diverted"" from fighting climate change because of the conflict. RUSSIA LAUNCHES INVASION OF UKRAINE, BIDEN SET TO SPEAK : LIVE UPDATES ""...Massive emissions consequences to the war, but equally importantly you're going to lose people's focus. You're going to lose, certainly, big country attention because they will be diverted, and I think it could have a damaging impact,"" Kerry said after stating that he was concerned about the people of Ukraine, as well as Russia's willingness to ""change boundaries of international law by force."" ""So, you know, hopefully I think President Putin would realize that in the northern part of his country, they used to live on  66% percent of a nation that was over frozen land. Now it's thawing and his infrastructure is at risk and the people of Russia are at risk,"" he added. ""And so I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.""  Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine early Thursday morning following weeks of speculation as Russian troop numbers swelled at the border between the two countries and in neighboring Belarus.  Critics took to social media to blast Kerry for focusing on climate change amid the start of a war.  JOHN KERRY FEARS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR WILL DISTRACT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE Kerry's comments garnered attention from international officials as well, with British Member of Parliament Marcus Fysh writing, ""These idiots are the problem.""  Other critics referred to Kerry's climate change advocacy over the war as a ""total clown show,"" while another called him a ""certified joker."" ANTI-RUSSIAN PROTESTS HIT US, EUROPE AMID UKRAINE INVASION ""Democrats are deranged, spoiled children and after 2022 should not be near any position of power for the foreseeable future,"" wrote former defensive end for the New England Patriots Jake Bequette, while another critic referenced Kerry flying to Iceland in a private jet to receive an environmental award. JOHN CENA SPARKS BACKLASH AFTER USING RUSSIA INVASION OF UKRAINE TO PROMOTE HBO SHOW ""Ukraine is getting bombed as we speak and John Kerry can only think about the possible emission of a war and that people will lose focus on climate change. He is a clown. Theyre all unfit for leadership. These people couldnt run a pretzel shop,"" wrote one critic, while another argued it was a national security threat for Kerry to have ever been Secretary of State.

ABC's Stephanpoulos spars with Chris Christie over energy independence: Climate change is 'existential crisis',"ABC's George Stephanopoulos said that climate change was an ""existential crisis"" during an exchange with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about domestic oil production amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Sunday's ""This Week."" Amid a discussion about the possibility of the U.S. banning Russian oil, Stephanopoulos asked Christie if the Republicans would ""forgo criticizing"" President Biden for increased gas prices if he makes the decision.  ""You have to do two things at the same time, and you should be able to. You have to ban Russian oil, and you have to increase domestic production. And that is where Joe Biden is going to have the problem because he's held captive by the environmental left,"" Christie said. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES The former New Jersey governor noted comments from John Kerry in which he said the war could have ""profound negative impact on the climate."" The Biden administration climate envoy added he hopes Russian President Vladimir Putin ""will help us stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.""  ""That will summarize what the far left's view is about domestic oil production,"" Christie said.  Stephanopoulos quickly shot back by citing a United Nations report that he summarized as saying climate change ""is an existential crisis and it's getting worse."" ""While people are being slaughtered? That's what Kerry is talking about?"" Christie asked as the other panelists tried to jump in. Panelist Donna Brazile interjected and said ""we can do two things at once."" CHRIS CHRISTIE: BIDEN FALLING ASLEEP AT CLIMATE SUMMIT SENDS WRONG MESSAGE TO THE WORLD ""We can protect our planet, we can protect our earth, climate change is also real. That's why the only approach is not drill, drill, drill, our approach is to be strategic and make sure our European allies stick with us because it's going to get very painful,"" she continued, applauding Biden and his actions so far.  ""It should have happened a long time ago,"" Christie said earlier in the segment of the potential oil ban. ""We should have been arming the Ukrainians for the last year, we weren't. We should have been doing much more on domestic production of oil, instead we're going backwards, and we gave Putin the card to hold us hostage."" Jonathan Karl, ABC's Chief Washington correspondent, said earlier on that it was ""extraordinary"" that Biden was sanctioning everything but Russian oil, ""the thing that drives their economy."" ABC'S JONATHAN KARL BAFFLED BY BIDEN SANCTIONING EVERYTHING BUT RUSSIAN OIL: EXTRAORDINARY ""The question of banning the import of oil and gas from Russia,"" Karl said. ""It is not insignificant. We actually take in more petroleum from Russia then we do from Saudi Arabia. It's extraordinary, George, for all the sanctions that have been imposed, and they have been unprecedented on Russia, to sanction everything but the thing that drives our economy.""

""I did not note the details of the artwork and would never support anything that denigrates the memory of all who were impacted by 9/11,"" Jackson said on Twitter. ""The artwork depicted is wrong and I fully reject it.""

"The worst Russia-Ukraine media takes make war about race, climate change, Trump, and more","The war in Ukraine since Russia President Vladimir Putin's invasion has sparked some controversial analysis in the liberal media. Ukrainians have taken up arms to defend their homeland as Russian troops continue to advance toward the capital, Kyiv. The invasion has claimed over 1,000 civilian casualties so far, according to the United Nations, while over 1 million refugees have fled to neighboring countries. While the war has united those of all political stripes in feeling compassion for the plight of the Ukrainian people, progressive pundits have uttered some partisan analysis of the fighting in recent days. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Race-based analysis MSNBC host Joy Reid claimed Monday that the war in Ukraine was getting so much attention due to demographics. ""The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to Western media compared to their Browner and Blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war,"" Reid said on ""The ReidOut."" ""We dont need to ask ourselves if the international response would be the same if Russia unleashed their horror on a country that wasn't White and largely Christian, because Russia has already done it. In Syria,"" she added, referencing Russia's deployment of soldiers to help quell the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil war. MSNBC'S JOY REID: WORLD PAYING ATTENTION TO UKRAINE BECAUSE IT'S A WHITE...CHRISTIAN NATION Voter suppression claims Several media pundits tried to tie the conflict in Ukraine to domestic matters. A few took swipes at President Biden, for instance, for failing to make a connection between the fight for freedom in Ukraine to voting rights efforts in the U.S. during his State of the Union address. ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd and his guest, author and Princeton University professor Eddie S. Glaude Jr., agreed that Biden missed an opportunity to mention the anniversary of Bloody Sunday in his remarks on Ukraine. Bloody Sunday occurred on March 7, 1965, when unarmed civil rights protesters were met with violent resistance from local law enforcement during a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, for voting rights. Todd said he was ""surprised"" by Biden's apparent whiff, while Glaude said he was ""stunned."" ""If there's one thing that surprised me about the president's State of the Union, it was the lack of connecting the fight for democracy and freedom abroad with the fight for democracy and freedom at home. Today's Bloody Sunday,"" Todd said. ""I was stunned,"" Glaude said. ""I mean, it was an easy kind of rhetorical move: Let's defend democracy abroad and secure democracy at home.""  MSNBC, CNN, OTHERS STRAIN TO LIKEN UKRAINIAN PLIGHT TO DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUES MSNBC's Tiffany Cross made the same connection, saying on a recent episode of ""The Cross Connection"" that as she observes the chaos in Ukraine, she realizes, ""democracy can be a fragile thing, and it feels a bit fragile in America right now."" She then accused the Republican Party of engaging in ""rampant voter suppression."" Climate concerns In a discussion about the possibility of the U.S. banning Russian oil on Sunday's ""This Week,"" ABC's George Stephanopoulos called climate change an ""existential crisis,"" defending comments made by former Secretary of State John Kerry that the war could have a ""profound negative impact on the climate."" Biden announced a ban on U.S. exports of Russian oil Tuesday. Downplaying prices at the pump Late-night host Stephen Colbert irked viewers by appearing to downplay the impact rising gas prices have had on Americans. ""Today the average gas price in America hit an all-time record high over $4 per gallon. OK, that stings, but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two. It's important. It's important. I'm willing to pay $4 dollars a gallon. Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla,"" Colbert said.   CBS correspondents defended Biden's claim Tuesday that his policies had not affected the prices at the pump. ""He also made it clear, Weijia, that his policies, the Biden administration policies, are not hurting oil production in this country. He wanted to make that clear, too,"" ""CBS Mornings"" co-anchor Gayle King told CBS senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang. ""Right, because thats what Republicans have been saying very forcefully. Wondering why we cant just ramp up oil production here. Well, the President just said that oil companies have the option to do that right now, but they arent taking it. And we did talk to a commodities expert, a strategist who said thats exactly right,"" Jiang agreed. Blaming Trump Other media figures like ""The View's"" Whoopi Goldberg and CNN's John Harwood chose to blame former President Trump for the current chaos or suggest the situation would have had been even more perilous if he was still commander in chief. ""If bonehead had been president, and I say what I said last time, there wouldnt have been any issue because that guy would have handed Ukraine over to the Russians,"" Goldberg claimed Monday. ""When you hear Republican politicians snipe at Biden on the crisis, Remember: the Republican president who left office last year used his term to strengthen Russia's hand and weaken Ukraine's, his party protected him as he did it, he still leads the party,"" Harwood tweeted of Trump. The blame game amused Fox News contributor Joe Concha, who said on Fox News Tuesday that Trump was ""living rent-free"" in many liberal pundits' minds.  Biden announced a ban on all imports of oil and gas from Russia Tuesday, acknowledging it would hurt Americans at the gas pump, but would be a ""powerful blow"" to Putin.",09/03/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-worst-russia-ukraine-media-takes-make-war-about-race-climate-change-trump-and-more
"John Kerry: Ukraine crisis is bad, but 'wait until you see' flood of climate refugees","President Bidens climate czar, John Kerry, said that while the Ukraine refugee crisis is a ""problem"" amid Russias invasion, it pales in comparison to the wave of migration that will come if climate change is not addressed.  Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, said during the annual CERAWeek conference in Houston Monday that the U.S. must not lose sight of its path toward clean energy now that the Russia-Ukraine war has accelerated the global energy crisis. JOHN KERRY FEARS RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR WILL DISTRACT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE ""Were already seeing climate refugees around the world,"" he said. ""If you think migration has been a problem in Europe in the Syrian War or even from what we see now, wait until you see 100 million people for whom the entire food production capacity has collapsed."" President Biden told reporters Tuesday that he ""cant do much"" about rising gas prices and blamed the situation on Russias war against Ukraine. The president announced Tuesday a ban on Russian oil, gas and energy imports to the U.S. in an effort to weaken Russian President Vladimir Putin, but the move is expected to push U.S. gas prices even higher as they soar past levels last seen during the Great Recession.  As of Wednesday afternoon, the national average was $4.29. While Republicans and some Democrats have called for expanded domestic oil production as a solution, Biden has continued to push his green agenda. ""Loosening environmental regulations wont lower prices,"" the president declared in a tweet Tuesday evening. ""But transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles, powered by clean energy, will mean that no one will have to worry about gas prices. It will mean tyrants like Putin wont be able to use fossil fuels as a weapon."" Kerry said Monday that the goal of the Biden administration is to move toward ""energy security"" in a ""clean energy-based economy."" ""We are driven not by politics, not by ideology,"" he said. ""We're driven by mathematics and physics, by science, which tells us, and has been for 35 years or more, what will happen if we don't do X, Y, and Z.  ""And we have the advantage now of having Mother Nature herself share with us the realities of what happens if you dont do the things that weve been talking about for 25, 30 years or more,"" he added.  Kerry has made similar comments linking climate change to the crisis in Ukraine. Last month, he told BBC Arabic that the war will have a ""profound negative impact on the climate."" ""You have a war, and obviously youre going to have massive emissions consequences to the war. But equally importantly, you're going to lose people's focus, you're going to lose certainly big country attention because they will be diverted, and I think it could have a damaging impact,"" he said.",09/03/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/john-kerry-ukraine-crisis-climate-refugees

"As war rages in Ukraine, Pentagon focused on climate change","Before and even during Russias war on Ukraine, Western observers continue to elevate climate change as a significant risk. This merely reveals their utter lack of seriousness. Theres a consistent record of elite fear that the masses are consuming the Earth. The predictions of pollution, famine, and death have all been proven wrong as humans are a net resource, not a liability due to ingenuity and adaptation. Thus, the straight line of doom from Timothy Snyders ""Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning"" where Snyder improbably concludes the Nazis monstrous evil was aimed at dealing with an ecological crisis, to Paul Ehrlichs ""The Population Bomb"" a generation earlier, to Thomas Robert Malthus, the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, and the view that the Irish potato famine was an ""effective mechanism for reducing surplus population."" ACTIVISTS MARCH THROUGH DC DEMANDING BIDEN DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY Now, of course, the sophisticates say the world will end in heat, storms, drought, and floodsall caused by mankinds growing prosperity due to the widespread availability of hydrocarbon energy. Yet, just as the population bomb foretold in 1968 never happenedthough it did influence policy, as bad ideas are prone to doneither has, nor will, climate doom. As Bjorn Lomborg and others have pointed out, climate-related death from floods, droughts, storms, wildfire, and extreme temperatures declined almost 100-fold from the 1920s to 2021, even as the global population grew four times from 2 billion to almost 8 billion. Wildfires used to burn about 4.2 percent of the land annually in the early 1900s; now, its 2.5 percent. In drought-prone California with its Mediterranean climate that concentrates the vast majority of its precipitation in the winter leaving much of the year dry, wildfires burned on average 4.5% and 12% of the state before 1800but 2020s 4.2 percent burn was hyped as a ""climate apocalypse"" rather than the result of poor or nonexistent forest management practices. Lastly, even in the U.S., the cost of flood losses as a share of the economy has steadily declined since the early 1900s. Dangerously, the U.S. Department of Defensean essential agency that should be focused on existential threats from Russia, with the worlds largest nuclear arsenal, and China, with its nuclear force growing exponentially by the decadehas been caught up in the nonsense. In the DoDs Climate Risk Analysis report published four months before Russia invaded Ukraine, there isnt a single mention of Russia nor Ukraine, and China is mentioned once in the context of potentially taking advantage of climate change fears in the ""Indo-Pacific, (due to) sea-level rise and more extreme weather events."" Never mind that coral-based atolls grow or subside naturally with the sea-level while scientific observations have found ""...significant decreasing trends in global hurricane numbers and ACE (Accumulated Cyclonic Energy) from 1990 to 2021."" Paradoxicallyat least for those unable to weigh risksRussias attack on Ukraine has led to the deaths of some 23,000 peopleboth military and civilian, made 10 million refugees, and caused $565 billion in property damage. Compared to climate-related deaths and damage in 2020 and 2021, the war has killed more than did climate extremes in the last two years and caused more damage in barely more than a month of fighting than did weather disasters globally in both 2020 ($210 billion) and 2021 ($329 billion). And even that damage is declining as a share of the worlds economy compared to prior decades as the absolute value of property improvements increase with the global GDP. Further adding to the manmade misery is the fact that Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of wheat and other foodstuffs. Ukraines farms are under attack and Russias farms may be embargoed. Even President Joe Biden predicted the world will see food shortages due to Russias invasion of Ukraine, saying, ""Its going to be real."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Add to the possibility of war-induced famine the record increase in the circulation of the dollar, which has driven U.S. food inflation to 7.9 percent last month, the highest since 1981. The war and irresponsible monetary policy will cause far more misery and suffering than any combination of climate extremes. That our leaders are focused on the latter (though only by working to make energy less affordable and less reliable) at the expense of the former shows their incompetence.  This is illustrated by the spectacle of former Secretary of State and current Climate Envoy John Kerry pleading with dictators to cut their emissionsdictators who laugh at our folly while they prepare for war.

"Vox writer pans climate activists, says to stop telling kids climate change will destroy the world","A writer for Vox hit back against claims that climate change will make the world uninhabitable and slammed activists for promoting pessimistic messaging that leave kids with feelings of anxiety and powerlessness. Staff writer Kelsey Piper wrote Wednesday that books aimed at her 5-year-old daughter regarding climate and conservation have given her a ""new perspective"" on the ""discourse wars"" that often reach children. She noted that the messaging for adults is more nuanced and upbeat in comparison to the dire predictions found in novels like ""Our House Is on Fire: Greta Thunbergs Call to Save the Planet."" ""Yes, some things will be worse, but because of progress on many fronts in addressing extreme poverty and disease, as well as general economic growth, our kids lives will be better than our parents lives were,"" Piper wrote.  The Vox writer noted that while climate change may lead to mass migrations and the displacement or the ""extinction of many species,"" it will not make the earth unlivable. In fact, the earth is now a better place to live, especially for low-income countries, ""than it ever has been."" Climate change is not going to make it as bad as it was, even in the 1950s, Piper asserted.  NEW YORK TIMES ACKNOWLEDGES GREEN CARBON OFFSET CREDITS DON'T WORK: 'TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE' Critiquing a passage from Thunbergs childrens illustration book in which the author wonders ""what use is a school without a future,"" Piper said that she was not ""thrilled about the message."" ""Some kids might hear that and be inspired to speak before the United Nations, but most kids are going to hear that and be scared and disempowered,"" she wrote.  THE HILL COLUMN SUGGESTS THE WAY TO FIGHT INFLATION IS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE Highlighting a 2021 Avaaz poll and a quote from conservation psychologist Susan Clayton, Piper wrote that a majority of young Americans think humanity is ""doomed"" and the earth could be unlivable in as little as 20 years.  ""Why do we see kids saying that? Because books, stories, and protest messaging aimed at them tell them that! Theres pessimism in the water around climate change, and kids often take that pessimism far more literally than adults do,"" Piper argued.  She added that adults are ""displacing their own frustration"" regarding political climate inaction onto children, and are doing so by telling kids falsehoods about the future of our world. DANGEROUS WEATHER FORECAST AFTER FIRE CREWS SLOW NEW MEXICO BLAZES In her conclusion, Piper claimed she has been unable to find childrens books that frame climate change as an inevitable threat, rather than a challenge for the next generation that is solvable. ""If you know of one, Im in the market for recommendations; if you dont know, I invite you to think about where this hole in our messages for children leaves them,"" she concluded.

One Indianapolis-based organization, called Keep Indianapolis Beautiful, was awarded $200,000 for an initiative called ""Greening Urban Neighborhoods,"" which included educating residents about ""the benefits of trees"" and increasing ""acceptance of trees in the City."" Another organization, the New Mexico-based Tree New Mexico, received ARP funds to plant trees in the ""underserved area of the southeast quadrant of Albuquerque."" That project included ""pruning workshops"" and providing ""tree care education"" with the goal of more residents becoming ""citizen tree stewards committed to caring for newly planted trees and older trees,"" and to decrease the ""heat island effect"" that occurs in urbanized areas. EPA SPENT $7M IN AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDSTO REPLACE DIESEL SCHOOL BUSES WITH ELECTRIC BUSES The Houston-based Black United Fund of Texas received ARP funds through the EPA program for a project developing ""a shipping container farm, residential gardens, green technology, tree and native habitat planting, workforce development, and public education."" According to the EPA website, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based Hourcar was also awarded EJCPS funds, funded by the ARP, to launch ""Evie Carshare, a new all-electric carsharing program featuring 150 shared electric vehicles supported by 70 curbside charging stations, with a focus on service to low-income and BIPOC communities."" The USASpending.gov website, which documents government spending, says that the $200,000 in ARP funds for the grant was ""obligated."" Just before Democrats passed the ARP in March 2021, without any Republican support, Biden described every allocation of funds in the legislation as essential.  ""We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan that deals with the immediate crisis  the urgency,"" the president said at the time. ""Now, critics say my plan is too big, that it costs $1.9 trillion. So thats too much. Well, let me ask them: What would they have me cut?  What would they have me leave out?"" Now, the ARP is facing intensifying scrutiny for its role in the current inflation crisis, which hit a whopping 8.6% last month. Some economists, including former Obama administration economic advisers, have blamed the ARP for overheating the economy. ""While our nation is $30 trillion in the hole and hemorrhaging money on the federal level, news like this should outrage every taxpayer,"" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., who sits on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""These examples are not appropriate functions of government, and are just the tip of the iceberg. The EPA  and I would argue every agency  must be held to account for how theyre utilizing public funds."" Fox News Digital previously reported that the EPA also used $5.25 million in ARP funds through its Environmental Justice Small Grants Program in 2021 to award grants for projects that had virtually little to do with addressing COVID-19 or the effects of the pandemic. One of the nonprofits that received a grant through that program was the Massachusetts-based organization Speak for the Trees for a project utilizing ""storytelling"" and ""tree walks,"" among other techniques, aimed to ""increase awareness and dialogue surrounding inequitable tree canopy cover and its implications on the health of residents living in [environmental justice] communities."" Clean Air Carolina, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, received a grant for a project to install a public Level 2 EV charging station and to create an educational video as a way for ""community members to get involved to mitigate air pollution.""  In a statement provided to Fox News Digital Wednesday evening, the EPA said all applications for the EJCPS program ""went through a rigorous scoring and approval process to ensure project activities and goals align with statutory authorities and the language and intent of ARP."" ""All applications selected for funding were reviewed by EPAs Office of General Counsel,"" the statement read. ""The EJ grants program funds community-driven projects. A basic tenet of environmental justice is that communities speak for themselves and are in the best position to know how to resolve challenges that they are facing. The EJ grants program, now with almost three decades of experience at awarding effective grants to communities across the country, has a record of investing taxpayer dollars in responsible ways and in places that meet communities needs and support longer term goals for community revitalization.""",23/06/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/epa-spends-millions-bidens-covid-bill-climate-change-pruning
Douglas Murray rips climate change activists' 'latest genius idea': A 'contempt for civilization',"Author and Fox News contributor Douglas Murray slammed climate change activists for their ""latest genius idea"" after some glued themselves to historic paintings in protest of fossil fuel use. Murray joined ""Fox &amp; Friends"" on Wednesday to discuss the left's latest trend in protest of Big Oil.  UK CLIMATE ACTIVISTS GLUE HANDS TO VINCENT VAN GOGH PAINTING AT LONDON MUSEUM DOUGLAS MURRAY: They've been developing this for a while. And now here is their latest genius idea, gluing themselves to masterpieces in galleries in Britain. They started in Glasgow, ended up at the Courtauld Institute, gluing themselves to a Van Gogh painting. Now to a copy by one of Leonardo's pupils of The Last Supper. And. And every time they not only showed disdain for the works of art, they used graffiti paint to spray graffiti within centimeters of these masterworks. They unveiled a sort of horrible copy of a canvas over one of John Constable's masterpieces very, very close to damaging that work. They not only showed contempt for the works of art, which to my mind is contempt for civilization. But this incredible narcissism, this incredible narcissism, who would do this kind of thing?

Biden says he will take executive action to address climate change should Congress fail to act,"President Biden on Friday warned that climate change and clean energy remain ""more urgent than ever,"" and said if the Senate will not tackle the issue, he will take ""strong executive action to meet this moment"" and ""will not back down."" The presidents comments come after Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., reportedly said that he will not support a bill before Novembers midterm elections with any provisions on energy and climate. Democrats had hoped to pass a sweeping package ahead of the election. Manchin responded to the reporting Friday in a radio interview, saying he would wait until August, after the July inflation numbers are released, to decide. ""Political headlines are of no value to the millions of Americans struggling to afford groceries and gas as inflation soars to 9.1%,"" Manchin spokesperson Sam Runyon said Thursday in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Senator Manchin believes its time for leaders to put political agendas aside, reevaluate and adjust to the economic realities the country faces to avoid taking steps that add fuel to the inflation fire."" In his statement, Biden said, ""Action on climate change and clean energy remains more urgent than ever,"" adding, ""Let me be clear: if the Senate will not move to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen our domestic clean energy industry, I will take strong executive action to meet this moment."" The president said his actions will ""create jobs, improve our energy security, bolster domestic manufacturing and supply chains, protect us from oil and gas price hikes in the future, and address climate change."" MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T SUPPORT CLIMATE, TAX PROVISIONS IN SWEEPING DEMOCRATIC BILL ""I will not back down: the opportunity to create jobs and build a clean energy future is too important to relent,"" Biden said. The president urged the Senate to ""move forward"" and pass the measure ""before the August recess and get it to my desk so I can sign it."" Biden said the measure will not only lower the cost of prescription drugs and health care for families, but claimed it would also ""reduce the deficit and help fight inflation"" as the nation grapples with the highest inflation rates in more than 40 years. Biden thanked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for his ""dogged and determined effort to produce the strongest possible bill to bring down costs, reduce the deficit, and combat the climate crisis while boosting our energy security  even offering significant compromises to try to reach an agreement."" ""Now, Congress must act quickly and get legislation to my desk to deliver for American families,"" he concluded. Manchin indicated he would support a reconciliation bill in August that includes a provision to lower prescription drug prices and a two-year extension of subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, according to a Democrat briefed on the conversations.  WAPO REPORTER: DELAYING BIDEN'S CLIMATE BILL COULD HAVE FATAL, PERMANENT AND GLOBAL EFFECTS, BLAME MANCHIN Manchin's demands mean Democrats would probably only be able to produce a far smaller bill that erases the hopes of many in the party to use it to fund clean energy incentives that could begin to help curb global warming. Previously, Democrats had removed other provisions like paid family leave amid negotiations with Manchin.  His vote is imperative for Democrats to be able to use the budget reconciliation process for the party-line bill, a process that only requires a majority vote rather than the 60-vote filibuster threshold.  REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: BUILD BACK BETTER BUDGET FIGHT RETURNS, THIS TIME AMID MORE INFLATION  Democrats have a slim 50-50 majority in the Senate (including 2 Independents who caucus with Democrats), and Vice President Kamala Harris would cast the tie breaking vote.

"Biden announces executive actions on 'climate crisis,' focuses on extreme heat and boosting offshore wind","President Biden announced Wednesday that he will be implementing a number of executive actions focused on combating climate change. Biden's executive actions come after Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., reportedly said that he will not support a package before the midterm elections which includes any provisions on energy and climate, with his spokesperson telling Fox News Digital that Manchin wants to ""avoid taking steps that add fuel to the inflation fire."" Included in the executive actions is an effort to ""protect communities from extreme heat and dangerous climate impacts,"" which includes $2.3 billion in funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program in 2022, which is intended to help communities ""increase resilience to heat waves, drought, wildfires, flood, hurricanes and other hazards by preparing before disaster strikes,"" according to the White House. The executive actions by Biden also include an effort to lower cooling costs for communities who are suffering from extreme heat, as the White House is issuing guidance that will assist states, tribes and territories in their funding for community cooling centers as well as helping people within their communities get access to cooling equipment. BIDEN SAYS HE WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD CONGRESS FAIL TO ACT Additionally, the Biden administration will consider potential wind power projects in the Gulf of Mexico, which are being proposed off the coast of Galveston, Texas, and off the coast of Lake Charles, Louisiana. The White House estimates that the projects have the potential to power over three million homes with ""clean energy."" Biden is also directing the Secretary of the Interior to ""advance clean energy development"" off the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina to ensure that ""these southeast states will be able to benefit from good-paying jobs in the burgeoning offshore wind industry."" MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T SUPPORT CLIMATE, TAX PROVISIONS IN SWEEPING DEMOCRATIC BILL Biden said while announcing the executive actions in Somerset, Massachusetts, that climate change is an ""emergency."" ""This is an emergency  an emergency  and I will look at it that way,"" Biden said. ""I said last week, I'll say it again, loud and clear. As president, I'll use my executive powers to combat climate change, the climate crisis in the absence of congressional action.""

"Climate change is here and Congress must act now to create a cleaner, healthier world","Discussion of climate change may seem abstract or theoretical, but here in the Puget Sound region we are already feeling its effects. We see climate change in the increasing and intensifying wildfires, storms, heat waves, and other natural disasters that continue to become more deadly, displace more people, and expose more communities to harmful environmental and health hazards. Around the world, climate change is a major driver of displacement, famine, and conflict. If left unaddressed, these effects are only going to become more costly and deadly.   Climate change represents the existential threat of our time and thinking about the sheer scope of the challenge can be terrifying. But the solution  transitioning off fossil fuels  presents an enormous opportunity for our country and our world. Its not all doom and gloom.  Moving to a clean energy economy can address some of the most-pressing issues facing individuals and families right now like health and wellbeing, energy costs, inflation, and economic opportunity.  BIDEN SAYS HE WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD CONGRESS FAIL TO ACT Fossil fuels have harmful effects on environmental health and wellbeing, which we have known about for years. Pollution from fossil fuels  whether from cars and trucks, gas furnaces and stoves, or manufacturing and industrial sites  negatively impacts public health, especially children and the most vulnerable members of our society. Transitioning to a clean-energy economy would drastically reduce harmful pollution and create cleaner, healthier communities.  A system reliant on fossil fuels also has consequences for consumers and their pocketbooks. Russias invasion of Ukraine and the global rise in oil and gas prices illustrates the volatility of the fossil fuel market and the impact it has at the pump. The increase in fuel costs is one of the primary drivers of inflation. As consumers get squeezed with rising costs from inflation and higher fuel prices, oil companies have made record profits during this crisis. All the while, the oil industry and its allies have shamelessly called for an increase in domestic oil production, which is a false solution.  Oil and gas production in the U.S. has been at an all-time high in recent years and the Biden-Harris administration approved more drilling permits per month than President Donald Trump did in any of his first three years in office. No matter how much fossil fuel energy we produce domestically, U.S. consumers will always be subject to price hikes based on whats happening in the global market.  The only way to be truly energy independent is to build an American economy no longer dependent on fossil fuels.  A renewable and clean energy economy would help combat inflation and bring more affordable, stable energy to consumers, insulating folks from the volatility we see today in the price of gas, utilities, and everyday goods. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will remove a huge point of economic and political leverage that oil-rich autocratic leaders in Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia wield to their benefit. That means our transition to a clean-energy economy isnt just smart domestic policy, it is also a matter of national security.  Senator Joe Manchin, D-WV, reportedly wants to wait until September, when Julys inflation numbers are released, to decide how to proceed on climate provisions in a reconciliation legislative package. Like Manchin, folks around the country are worried about the price of gas and higher costs for everyday goods. Im worried about rising prices too.  But that is exactly why we need to keep making the case that a clean energy economy can help address the challenges we face  including inflation.  We arent going to convince skeptics if we only talk about the existential threat of climate change. We must focus on the opportunity in front of us. An economy that runs on renewable and clean energy will improve peoples health and wellbeing; reduce energy costs for consumers; minimize drastic energy price swings; create good paying jobs; and promote national security and global stability.   Congressional Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration have made clear our commitment to combating climate change. Its been at the forefront of executive actions from day one of this administration, and it was a pillar of the Build Back Better Act that passed in the House last year.  But legislative days are quickly running out and we face hard choices. If an agreement on climate provisions can be reached with Manchin, the choice is clear.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Congress must not squander our best opportunity to take significant climate action during Bidens first term  its time to move a reconciliation bill that puts the country on a path toward net-zero emissions and to decarbonize every sector of the economy.  If we can successfully include other priorities  such as prescription drug pricing reform  then we should, but passage of a major climate bill is going to require members of Congress to make concessions on unresolved, non-climate related priorities and fight those battles separately. This is of course not the ideal outcome, but it is the prioritization necessary to push through a climate package that will truly catalyze our clean energy future.    If an agreement can ultimately be reached with Manchin on investments in climate and clean energy, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Our collective success will require all of us who take climate change seriously to convince the American people, especially skeptics, that passing an aggressive clean energy package is an opportunity to not only tackle climate change, but also address some of the pain points that Americans across the country are feeling right now. Its on us, and the time is now.",20/07/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-congress-must-act-cleaner-healthier-world
Biden pledges to mobilize presidency to combat climate change: 'Code red for humanity',"President Biden declared on Wednesday the threat of climate change had reached ""code red for humanity,"" demanding an all-encompassing response from the White House.  Biden, fresh off seeing his climate agenda rejected in Congress, pledged to utilize the full powers of the executive branch to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50% by 2030.  ""This is an emergency and I will look at it that way,"" the president said during a speech in Massachusetts. ""I'll use my executive powers to combat the climate crisis in the absence of congressional action.""  Biden said the White House was planning a series of executive actions in the coming weeks to address climate change. While the president did not elaborate directly on how expansive those actions would be, Biden touted several actions the administration is taking.  DEM SENATORS CALL FOR BIDEN 'UNCHAINED' ON CLIMATE EXECUTIVE ACTION, DESPITE RECENT SUPREME COURT EPA RULING One of those was a new $2.3 billion grant program announced Wednesday for state and local communities to build climate-resilient infrastructure. White House officials were also removing prohibitions blocking states from using federal money to set up community cooling centers to stave of extreme heat.  ""It is literally  not figuratively  a clear and present danger,"" the president said when discussing climate change. ""The health of our citizens and our communities is literally at stake.""  HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS LEADER CLAIMS CLIMATE CHANGE IS 'LARGEST NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT' FACING US, WORLD During the speech, Biden made a number of gaffes. He mispronounced the name of Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., and then asked, ""Where is she?"" In addition, he mentioned ""Glasgow, England,"" misstating the country, Scotland, where the city is actually located. And also said, ""thats why I and so damn many other people I grew up with have cancer."" A White House official told Fox News that Biden was referring to past removal of skin cancer in his remarks. Biden mistakenly stated (present tense) that he has cancer. Biden also praised the advance of clean energy technology, while pledging to continue to support it with federal investment. The president warned, however, that such action would be tied to companies using union labor or providing their employees with competitive pay and benefits. ""We're going to build a different future,"" he said. ""One with green energy and good paying jobs.""  The speech came after negotiations stalled once again in Congress on including green energy subsidies in a party-line spending bill. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently urged his party to delay including tax and climate change provisions within the package until there was a clear picture of the national economy.  Without Manchin's support, the tax is unlikely to become law. That is because Democrats can only pass the legislation within the 50-50 Senate via a party-line process known as budget reconciliation.  The setback has left Democrats demanding Biden utilize the full powers of the presidency to address climate change unilaterally.  ""We have a president who campaigned on climate, who has been chained to the legislative process, thinking about his past as a senator,"" said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. ""Now he's unchained, and he has to go.

Climate change 'deadline' crosses ominous threshold as activists warn world is nearly out of time,"The Climate Clock, an online tool and algorithm designed to calculate humanity's deadline for reducing global warming, fell below seven years Friday. The clock, which was developed in 2020 to give a sense of urgency to world leaders, fell from seven years to six years and 364 days, according to algorithm. The tool shows how much time is left to limit global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. ""The clock is a portable scientific instrument,"" Climate Clock co-founder Andrew Boyd told Fox News Digital. ""It reduces a lot of complexity into a simple, clear message and mission: We need to transition from fossil fuels to 100% renewable energy, and we have seven years to do it."" CLIMATE ACTIVISTS EXPAND TIRE-SLASHING OPERATION BEYOND NYC. HERE ARE THE CITIES THEY'VE HIT ""With climate change, winning slowly is the same as losing,"" Boyd continued. ""The Climate Clock shows that we have a deadline. That is our best window to avert climate catastrophe. The next seven years are our best shot."" Roughly 13% of energy production worldwide is sourced from renewables like solar and wind, according to the Climate Clock. Friday marks the first official ""Climate Emergency Day"" when the Climate Clock counts down from seven years to six years, Gan Golan, another Climate Clock co-founder, told Fox News Digital. He added that people worldwide will observe a moment of silence to ""mark the moment."" ""The planet, and everyone on it, is under threat,"" Golan said. ""Climate change is not happening in the future, it is happening here and now."" DC-AREA CLIMATE PROTESTERS SHUT DOWN MARYLAND HIGHWAY; 14 ARRESTED Human activity is believed to have already caused between 0.8-1.2 degrees Celsius of warming, according to a recent report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report warned that climate-related risks for natural and human systems will increase substantially if warming isn't stabilized. Meanwhile, Western governments have attempted to push an aggressive green transition away from fossil fuels in recent years, but have faced recent pushback amid a global energy crisis which has led to higher consumer prices worldwide. While European governments have starting boosting coal dependence during the crisis, the U.S. government has struggled to approve climate legislation activists say is necessary to achieving net-zero emissions. Last week, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced his opposition to major climate bill Democrats and President Biden have advocated for. The West Virginia Democrat pointed to high prices and inflation when explaining his position. Boyd and Golan both criticized Manchin, though, arguing he was beholden to fossil fuel interests.  ""[Manchin] has personally made over $5.2 million in profits from coal, and has also taken hundreds of thousands in campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry,"" Golan told Fox News Digital. ""Hes made it perfectly clear to Americans that those personal profits mean more to him than our childrens future."" ""The public overwhelmingly wants greater action by our government,"" Boyd added. ""But our government is being held back from doing its job to protect our lives and our families.

"Climate activists embrace extreme tactics, violence as deadline to 'save the planet' draws near","Climate change activists in the U.S. and across the world are ramping up their actions in what they say is an attempt to save the planet.  In recent months, far-left activists have glued themselves to famous paintings, disrupted new pipeline construction, scaled buildings, blocked rush-hour traffic, lit themselves on fire, threatened to  disrupt the Congressional Baseball Game and slashed tires of random sport utility vehicles (SUV) in cities around the world.  The activists have argued that world governments have failed citizens by not acting aggressively enough to enact policies curbing warming. ""We cannot continue to wait around for a bunch of corporate shills in Congress to do nothing while people are dying,"" Greenpeace USA senior climate campaigner Ashley Thomson said last week. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS KEEP PUSHING EXTREME MEASURES AMID GLOBAL ENERGY CRISIS Greenpeace, one of the oldest environmental organizations of its kind in the world, and its international affiliates have staged multiple ""direct actions"" this year ranging from scaling a venue hosting a major conference in France to blocking a ship from departing a Dutch port to climbing a deep sea mining vessel in the North Sea. Such actions have seemingly become more common in the face of, what activists deem, an impending global disaster. ""Climate change is the only issue where, in the worst case, it really would affect the ability of our civilization to continue. The threat there is just much higher,"" climate activist Ken Ward told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""If you do a bad job on clean water, then you've got some polluted water  you can recoup that. With the worst case in climate change, that's not an option."" ""If you're on track to have the southern part of our nation unlivable and also dehydrated in 20 years or less, what do you do about that?"" Ward continued. ""If there was agreement that was a serious threat, then we would drop other things that we are doing and pay attention to that."" DC-AREA CLIMATE PROTESTERS SHUT DOWN MARYLAND HIGHWAY; 14 ARRESTED In October 2016, Ward closed the valve to a pipeline transporting crude oil from western Canada to Mount Vernon, Washington, as part of a coordinated action. That same day, fellow activists  who, along with Ward, were collectively known as the ""Valve Turners""  shut off valves to similar pipelines in Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota. Ward, who eventually pled guilty to trespassing following the incident, told Fox News Digital that such action is necessary if ""there's political gridlock and all the ordinary processes aren't working.""  Activists like Ward often cite United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and the so-called Climate Clock, an online tool developed in 2020 to highlight how long humanity has left to limit global warming, when highlighting the immediate need for action. Greenpeace, for example, said governments better act on climate change or they will be ""forced to do so"" following the latest IPCC report in April. ""For decades, fossil fuels corporations paid millions to confuse the public, contradict the science and falsely claim that climate change was a hoax,"" Climate Clock co-founder Gan Golan told Fox News Digital. ""That tactic isnt working anymore because the results are plain for all of us to see. So, they have rolled out a new tactic: delay. Climate delay has become the new climate denial.""

""It's clear that new oil and gas is going to cause unimaginable suffering for the people of this country and, indeed, the people around the world who are suffering at the expense of climate change now,"" the Just Stop Oil spokesperson continued. The spokesperson said the group was planning a campaign involving thousands of people for later in the year. Activists have also repeatedly formed blockades on busy highways to call attention to climate change and urge elected officials to do more. CLIMATE CHANGE 'DEADLINE' CROSSES OMINOUS THRESHOLD AS ACTIVISTS WARN WORLD IS NEARLY OUT OF TIME ""We have a brief and rapidly closing window to address the climate crisis,"" said a protester, who was part of a group calling upon President Biden to declare a climate emergency by blocking traffic on I-395 in Washington D.C. on April 14. ""The government isnt listening."" A man whose car was blocked during the April protest pleaded with the activists to let his car through, saying he had to travel to see his wife give birth. During a similar July 4 protest advocating for a climate emergency declaration, a driver begged activists blocking a Maryland highway to let him through since he was on parole and had to show up to work on time. The White House said Tuesday that Biden is still considering declaring a climate emergency after Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., effectively killed Democrats' hopes for sweeping climate legislation last week. However, Biden opted against making such a pronouncement this week, instead announcing a series of executive actions during a speech in Massachusetts on Wednesday. Varshini Prakash, the executive director of the grassroots Sunrise Movement, said following the speech that Biden may forever be known as ""the president who condemned my generation to an unlivable world.""  ""If we look at a world that has the number of people that we're going to see dying and the number of people who are going to be  population shifting around because parts of the world won't be livable anymore, we're just going to see a lot more wars and fighting and murder, because that will be what people think is an appropriate response to the collapse of the conditions that make their nation possible,"" Ward told Fox News Digital. ""So, I do think that opportunity to engage in this one tool of, not just direct action but also mass non-violent action as a means of change which we know is pretty effective  the window for doing something in that vein is getting shorter,"" he said.",25/07/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-activists-embrace-extreme-tactics-violence-deadline-save-planet-draws-near
CNN correspondent sounds alarm on ??limate crisis?? 'Fate of life on Earth is at stake',"CNN climate correspondent Bill Weir claimed the fate of the planet and American democracy was at risk if congressional action is not taken to combat climate change.  On Tuesday, Weir was asked by anchor Jim Sciutto what the Biden administration can do within its scope to tackle the issue, noting Democrats could lose control of the House and the Senate in November.  Weir said Biden is currently speaking with lawyers to determine how far he can ""stretch"" his executive powers to take action, and said that part of the plea by staffers protesting against Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was to get Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., to change his mind on legislation.  ""This is hung up on an old-fashioned filibuster, sort of recent, made-up American rules, where the fate of life on earth is at stake and doesnt seem to match,"" Weir added.  DOUGLAS MURRAY BLASTS AL GORE'S COMPARISON OF 'CLIMATE DENIERS' TO UVALDE OFFICERS The CNN correspondent continue by claiming the issue of climate change should touch every cabinet of the government ""holistically"" and ""realistically."" Weir also told Sciutto that he recently spoke with a prestigious high school debate team; according to him, the team wondered whether U.S. democracy even had the capabilities to ""stomach"" a ""climate crisis."" ""What kind of governments can?"" Weir asked. ""And I think the proof that we see around us is that the American form of democracy, the 2022 version certainly cannot."" MANCHIN 'BETRAYAL' SLAMMED BY LA TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD, WAPO COLUMNIST: 'PEBBLE IN PRESIDENT BIDENS SHOE' Sciutto then suggested that climate change action has stalled because there is very little ""compromise"" and ""sacrifice"" in modern American politics, to which Weir agreed.  On Monday, more than a dozen staffers protested and subsequently took over the office of Schumer, demanding action and legitimate policy to fight climate change. Many of them were quickly arrested by Capitol Police.  ""Around 11:15 a.m., U.S. Capitol Police officers responded to a demonstration that was inside room 322 in the Hart Senate Office Building. Six demonstrators were arrested for DC Code 22-3302 Unlawful Entry for failing to leave the office after they were told to leave. The six people who were arrested are all House staffers,"" the police said in a public statement.  JOE MANCHIN SCORNED BY LIBERAL MEDIA AS HE MULLS STALLING BIDEN CLIMATE AGENDA In recent months, far-left activists have glued themselves to famous paintings, disrupted new pipeline construction, scaled buildings, blocked rush-hour traffic, lit themselves on fire, threatened to disrupt the Congressional Baseball Game and slashed tires of random sport utility vehicles (SUV) in cities around the world.   The activists have argued that world governments have failed citizens by not acting aggressively enough to enact policies curbing climate change.

Eight years? Nine years? Six years ago? A climate change activist guide to doomsday,"Advocates of combating climate change are increasingly invoking doomsday scenarios to pressure President Biden to take unilateral action to lower greenhouse gas emissions, despite a history of such claims falling flat.  The rhetoric is coming not only from progressive activists but also Democrats on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers, in particular, have intensified their doomsday predictions as hopes for a climate change deal have waned within the Senate in recent days.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently told supporters that if immediate action was not taken on climate change, an immigration and public health crisis was likely to appear by 2030.    CLIMATE ACTIVISTS EMBRACE EXTREME TACTICS, VIOLENCE AS DEADLINE TO 'SAVE THE PLANET' DRAWS NEAR ""Thousands of people are dying,"" said Sanders. ""Youre going to see more mass migrations, more diseases ... For the sake of future generations, our kids, our grandchildren, we have got to act.""  Concordia University echoed a similar message when publicizing its Climate Clock. Launched in 2020 to give world leaders a sense of urgency, the clock purports to denote the amount of time humanity has left to address climate change to avoid the most dangerous consequences of global warming.  At the moment, that figure stands at just under seven years. Activists say that is time left to avert disaster by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  In 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested the humanity would be done by 2031.  ""Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and were like: The world is gonna end in 12 years if we dont address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?"" she said. Critics note that the doom and gloom is nothing new. They say it's part of a long-running strategy that sees proponents of combating climate change lay out alarming predictions of global catastrophe.   ""People have been proclaiming the end of the world since forever. All have been wrong,"" said Steve Milloy, who advised President Donald Trump on staffing the Environmental Protection Agency after the 2016 election. ""They make these End Times predictions for a variety of reasons ranging from ignorance to politics to personal aggrandizement.""  Some point to former Vice President Al Gore as the poster boy for the strategy. Gore has made millions and won a Nobel Peace Prize for his climate change activism.  But some of his major predictions have failed to become reality. CLIMATE ACTIVISTS EXPAND TIRE-SLASHING OPERATION BEYOND NYC. HERE ARE THE CITIES THEY'VE HIT In 2006, Gore told audiences while marketing his documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" that the world would reach a point of no return in ten years if the global economy did not transition away from fossil fuels. Likewise, Gore in 2009 cited evidence suggesting that there was a 75% chance that by 2013, the North Pole would start becoming ""ice-free"" for a portion of the summer. Some experts say the reason why such predictions prove faulty, even when backed up by scientific studies, is because it's difficult to gauge the economic and social impact of changes in temperature.  ""It's incredibly difficult to translate temperature increases into changing weather effects using predictive models,"" said Myron Ebell, the director of the Competitive Enterprise Institutes center for energy and environment. ""Most of the time the data doesn't line up or scientists assume a larger temperature increase will happen than actually does and that skews the entire prediction.""   Critics say that studies trying to analyze the impact of changes in temperature rely heavily on correlations, rather than causes  Doomsday predictions have only increased as climate legislation on Capitol Hill has stalled because of Democratic infighting.  Last week, 60 House Democrats echoed the message when calling on Biden to declare a national emergency on climate change. The move would allow the White House to mobilize emergency powers to lower carbon emissions.  ""If we dont really begin to lower emissions, this planet has no chance,"" Rep. Alan Lowenthal, D-Calif, said recently. ""We have a few years left and thats it. The planet is dying.""  Democrats have also tried to capitalize on the recent heatwave besieging the East Coast as proof that climate change is getting worse and dire action is needed.  Milloy says such tactics ignore broader trends and data when it comes to the climate.  ""Climate alarmists are trying to surf a heat wave to pressure Joe Biden into declaring a climate emergency,"" he said.",26/07/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-activists-embrace-doomsday-rhetoric-despite-falling-flat-in-previous-warnings
CBS pushes study blaming climate change for rising childhood obesity rates,"""CBS Mornings"" pushed a recent study connecting climate change and hotter temperatures with childhood obesity rates in a ridiculed segment on Thursday. Co-host Nate Burleson introduced the study published in the journal ""Temperature"" that argued ""climate change, specifically warmer temperatures is making our children more inactive and more obese."" Burleson said the study found that children were 30% less ""aerobically fit"" than their parents and claimed hotter temperatures were preventing kids from exercising outside. Although the segment focused primarily on climate change, Burleson acknowledged that technology was likely a factor in rising childhood obesity cases. CNN CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT POSTS (AND DELETES) TWEET CLAIMING REPUBLICANS ARE SPEEDING UP END OF THE WORLD  ""Now listen, it has been a lot hotter, and the weather has been crazy, but I think it also has to do with technology, you know. Its one thing not to go outside, but these kids dont go outside because they can stay inside and be on their phones, play video games, and be social without having to go outside and be social,"" Burleson said. Several Twitter users, however, attacked the segment for emphasizing ""climate change"" as a factor in childhood obesity without also recognizing coronavirus lockdowns. ""Do you think it could be... nah, couldn't be. Must be the climate change,"" Deseret News contributing writer Bethany Mandel joked. Hans Mahncke, co-host of ""Truth Over News"" on EpochTV, tweeted, ""They made kids fat by shutting schools, playgrounds, parks and beaches. Predictably, they're now blaming climate change. If there aren't severe penalties for the fraudsters who pushed lockdowns, it'll happen again."" ""Climate change? Ffs,"" National Review journalist Claude Thompson wrote. Former congresswoman Nan Hayworth tweeted, ""NO. NO. NO. Many factors contribute to children's lack of fitness, but climate change is NOT one of them. This is propaganda that CBS, as with all mainstream media, pushes to scare Americans into accepting Government intervention--at any cost!!--against climate *apocalypse*"" Washington Free Beacon reporter Joe Gabriel Simonson attacked ""CBS Mornings"" directly for misrepresenting the study to push a climate agenda. ""[T]his seemed too insane even for left-wing climate scientists so I read the study summary. the authors don't blame climate change for children getting fatter, but that fat children may have a harder time dealing with climate change because fat people don't do as well in the heat,"" Simonson tweeted.

Harrison Ford frequent flier on private jets despite climate change activism,"Harrison Ford, a famous Hollywood actor, has frequently traveled via private jet in recent months despite his well-known climate change activism. Ford's private jet, a multimillion-dollar Cessna Citation Sovereign, has made at least eight trips stretching roughly 5,284 miles and emitting about 35 metric tons of carbon dioxide in less than two months, according to data from ADS-B Exchange and Celebrity Jets.  Ford, however, has made regular appearances at global climate conferences, calling upon individuals and government leaders to support efforts to reduce emissions and prevent disastrous global warming. ""It's hard to read the headlines  floods, fires, famines, plagues  and tell your children that everything is alright,"" he remarked at a conservation summit in France last year. ""It's not alright. Damn it, it's not alright. It's alright to feel frustration, anxiety, grief, but don't run away from it. Cry out for justice, justice for mother nature."" ""The Earth has irreplaceable ecosystems rich in carbon and biodiversity,"" he continued. ""By preserving just a small fraction of these wetlands, tropical forests and mangroves, we can protect our wildlife, our air, water, food jobs and climate."" LEONARDO DICAPRIO FUNNELED GRANTS THROUGH DARK MONEY GROUP TO FUND CLIMATE NUISANCE LAWSUITS, EMAILS SHOW Ford added that a younger generation of climate activists has the energy and conscience to do ""what we have not yet been able to do."" ""If we don't stop the destruction of the natural world, nothing else will matter,"" Ford said during a separate speech at the 2020 Global Climate Action Summit. But Ford's jet has emitted more carbon into the environment in less than two months than the average American burns every two years and the average person worldwide burns every nine years. The average carbon footprint of an American is 16 tons a year while the average person worldwide burns about 4 tons a year, according to The Nature Conservancy. CLIMATE ACTIVISTS EMBRACE EXTREME TACTICS, VIOLENCE AS DEADLINE TO 'SAVE THE PLANET' DRAWS NEAR Over the last two months, the jet has frequently traveled to and from Los Angeles suburb Hawthorne, California, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, the flight tracking data showed. The longest tracked flight was a 1,203-mile trek from Wichita, Kansas, to Hawthorne. That trip alone burned seven metric tons of carbon. A representative for Ford didn't respond to a request for comment. CLIMATE ACTIVIST STEVEN SPIELBERG'S PRIVATE JET HAS BURNED $116,000 WORTH OF JET FUEL IN TWO MONTHS Ford, though, is not the only celebrity and climate activist to prefer private jet travel over commercial airlines. Hollywood director Steven Spielberg burned a whopping $116,159 worth of jet fuel between June 23 and Aug. 22, Fox News Digital previously reported. Spielberg's Gulfstream G650 flew more than 17,000 miles and burned at least 179 metric tons of carbon in that time span.  Leonardo DiCaprio has flown via private jet and traveled long distances on yachts while pushing extreme climate measures and financially supporting nuisance lawsuits against Big Oil firms. The actor flew approximately 8,000 on a private jet in 2016 to receive an environmental award.

Greg Gutfeld: Biden warns UN of climate 'crisis' but spends billions on Ukraine war,"President Biden's warning to the United Nations General Assembly about the climate ""crisis"" is an interesting juxtaposition given the fact he has simultaneously helped bankroll the Ukrainians in their military resistance against the Russians, Greg Gutfeld argued Wednesday. ""I find it interesting that in this you saw Biden talking about  I wonder, is $60 billion in arms sent to Ukraine? Does that help or hurt the climate crisis?"" Gutfeld asked on ""The Five."" ""Just putting it out there. I mean, it kind of seems like you can't say both things. You can't tell us we're in a crisis and then keep a war going on with billions and billions of our dollars, with missiles and bombs and trucks,"" he continued, as none of those items are particularly climate-friendly. Gutfeld added that, in terms of the war, Vladimir Putin likely did not count on having to potentially conscript retirees and reservists to fight  which he called a credit to the Ukrainian military and billions of American taxpayer dollars sent overseas. BIDEN OFFICIAL GRILLED AFTER LATEST TAIWAN DECLARATION CONTRADICTS POLICY: HE SAID IT FOUR TIMES Russian military morale will likely crater if it hasn't already, the host added.

HHS embraces new mission: 'Climate Change and Health Equity',"One of the largest departments in the federal government says it has role to play in safeguarding Americans' health from the effects of climate change, and argues this role is ""firmly rooted in public health history."" The Department of Health and Human Services is a $2 trillion entity that houses agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration. Last week, the departments new Office of Climate Change and Health Equity said it was ready to tackle the challenges of climate-related health impacts, just as the government took on sanitation standards and air pollution decades ago. WEST VIRGINIA GOVERNOR TORCHES DEMOCRATS' ENERGY AGENDA: HOW CAN ANYBODY DEFEND WHAT'S GOING ON IN DC? ""The incredibly broad effects of climate change and the many ways it worsens existing inequities in the United States must be met with a swift and sustained public health response,"" wrote John Balbus, the interim director of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity. ""Our country helped eradicate polio and sanitized our cities. Now we must rise to meet another challenge."" Balbus said part of that work is ensuring the health of ""disadvantaged"" groups that would be most affected by climate change. ""Climate change does not affect all of us the same way. Just as unsanitary urban settings at the turn of the 20th century primarily affected low-income and immigrant communities, climate change likewise often hurts disadvantaged groups most,"" he wrote. As one example, he said if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius, ""Black and African American individuals are 34% more likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood asthma."" GAVIN NEWSOM'S 2024 CHANCES COULD BE THREATENED BY CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID STRUGGLES The Office of Climate Change and Health Equity says it exercises the ""power of convening, coordination and collaboration"" to advance ""climate change and health policy"" as it pursues ""environmental justice and equitable health outcomes."" Among its priorities are identifying communities with ""disproportionate exposures to climate hazards and vulnerable populations,"" and addressing ""health disparities exacerbated by climate impacts to enhance community health resilience."" JOHN KERRY'S CLIMATE OFFICE FIRE WITH TIES TO FAR-LEFT GREEN GROUPS HHS has also established an Office of Environmental Justice within the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, which focuses on the ""people of color, disadvantaged, vulnerable, low-income, marginalized, and indigenous peoples"" who are ""disproportionately burdened by environmental hazards.""  The new climate change mission at HHS was established by an executive order from President Biden that he released in his first week in office. That order created a special presidential envoy for climate, a role filled by former Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and gave most major federal departments a climate change mission. It specifically instructed HHS to create its Office of Climate Change and Health equity to ""address the impact of climate change on the health of the American people.""

"Democrats blaming climate change for Hurricane Ian at odds with science, experts say","Multiple experts contacted by Fox News Digital argued that there isn't sufficient evidence to suggest climate change caused Hurricane Ian or any individual natural disaster. The experts' comments come as a series of media outlets, Democrats and progressive commentators continue to blame the hurricane on human-caused global warming. Hurricane Ian slammed into southwest Florida as a Category 4 storm on Wednesday, causing more than a million residents to lose power and prompting stark safety warnings from Florida officials. ""What they're trying to do is politicize the pain and suffering of these people to promote their green agenda,"" Gregory Wrightstone, the executive director of the climate policy think tank CO2 Coalition, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Well, their policies and their agenda to promote renewables will do far greater economic destruction to the country and Florida."" Over the last several days, media outlets, including the New York Times, Associated Press, Politico, NPR and Axios, have published news stories reporting that climate change is to blame for Hurricane Ian and the storm's rapid intensification. A Time magazine article said the ""science is well known"" that climate change created the conditions for Hurricane Ian. NASA: VIDEO OF HURRICANE IAN CAPTURED FROM SPACE STATION AS IT HITS FLORIDA In addition, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., appeared to suggest that Americans need to vote for Democrats to avoid future hurricanes during an interview Tuesday. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., tweeted Thursday that ""the rapid storm intensification we're seeing with Hurricane Ian will become more common and more dangerous"" as the climate changes. And a series of progressive commentators and climate activists took to social media to similarly peg the hurricane on global warming. MIDTERM CANDIDATES RUNNING RACES IN HURRICANE IAN'S PATH REACT TO THE DISASTROUS STORM ""Ian is a climate change hurricane,"" Pam Keith, a former Democratic Senate candidate and founder of left-wing firm Center for Employment Justice, tweeted Wednesday. ""[Hurricane Ian] is a textbook example of climate change impacting people,"" Nina Turner, a senior fellow at progressive think tank Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, added. ""Climate change isnt political, its reality."" However, Wrightstone and the other experts contacted by Fox News Digital rejected those arguments, arguing that individual storms cannot be linked to climate change. ""If you read what [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)] says on hurricanes, there's just not enough data,"" Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow at the Energy &amp; Environment Legal Institute, told Fox News Digital. ""There's nothing to back up what they're saying is,"" he continued. ""There were about 16 major hurricanes between 1916 and 1965 but only six since 1965. So, clearly major hurricanes happen with lower levels of carbon dioxide. That doesn't add up for them."" BIDEN SUGGESTS AMERICANS NOT PROUD OF US IN DIVISIVE FUNDRAISER SPEECH AS FLORIDA PUMMELED BY HURRICANE IAN A NOAA study last revised in July concluded that its models and analysis didn't support the notion that greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to large increases in either tropical storm or overall hurricane numbers in the Atlantic. The study, authored by senior NOAA scientist Tom Knutson, added that it was ""premature to conclude with high confidence"" that human-caused increasing greenhouse gases have had any impact on hurricane activity in the Atlantic. Jamie Rhome, the acting director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center, echoed the study's findings in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, pushing back against anchor Don Lemon's argument that Hurricane Ian's intensification is tied to climate change. Rhome said he ""would caution against"" linking any one storm to climate change. ""Trying to blame global warming for Hurricane Ian not only defies scientific evidence  the clear weight of scientific evidence  but it is a despicable politicization of a real tragedy that requires our attention and focus on the people negatively affected,"" James Taylor, the president of conservative think tank Heartland Institute, said in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""These types of hurricanes existed before SUVs and coal-fired power plants were invented,"" Taylor added. ""In fact, they were much more frequent and severe before coal power plants and SUVs.""  Wrightstone, who also serves as an expert reviewer for the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), added that the number of hurricanes this year has actually been lower than previous years. ""The IPCC sees no correlation between warming temperatures and more hurricanes,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""And we saw that this year. Up until this hurricane, which is massive, it had been almost historically low numbers of hurricanes.""",30/09/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-blaming-climate-change-hurricane-ian-odds-science-experts-say

Inflation, which nationally hit a 40-year record-high of 9.1% in June, ranked sixth. Climate change is ""only going to get worse if we don't act on it now,"" London, from Milwaukee, said. But 91% of Republican voters polled in the Marquette survey said inflation was their top issue. They rated climate change last.  ""I really don't care about climate change,"" Matt said. ""It's normal for temperature to change."" But Christian, from Milwaukee, said Americans need to think about potentially drastic climate changes ahead in the next few decades.

David, visiting from Texas, told Fox News: ""Climate change is part of a more dire an issue of something that needs to be corrected while the other will eventually correct itself."" He said the U.S. recovered from heightened inflation in the past.  Democrats across the country have implemented policies in an effort to slow climate change. Congress, for example, in August passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included tax subsidies for electric vehicles. Gov.

""It's critical that that be addressed,"" one man said on high inflation. ""Climate change is more of a long-term aspiration.""

"King Charles III: A climate change of mind? Not so quick, royal expert says","While our brand new King Charles has only been in the job a matter of days it appears that, unlike his previous life, he is of course taking things a tad more cautious than previously. This is not just in his new role, but his more measured response to things where previously he may have spoken openly and now takes that vital moment to check with his much respected courtiers around him about matters of state. Plus, of course the legacy that his highly respected late mother Queen Elizabeth II of 70 years on the real throne would have done. She has taught him well that is for sure, but the story of his changing his mind about attending a United Nations climate conference is intriguing in many respects as this particular cause is one that is so close to the king's heart that even as recently as July this year the then-Prince Charles was carrying the baton for climate change.He, though, is not alone and his eldest son and youngest son, the non-royal working Prince Harry, have all spoken out in public about their own personal thoughts about the climate and what is going on in the future.  It was only last year William, Kate and the then-Prince of Wales all attended the United Nations climate conference, also known as Cop 26, in Scotland meeting many stars at the event specially attending in their private jets like Leonardo DiCaprio along with many others. So it came a shock to many to find that His Majesty the King had pulled out of attending this year's U.N. climate conference in Egypt in November on the advice of the latest and brand new British Prime Minister Liz Truss ... or did he? KING CHARLES III MAY REMOVE PRINCESS BEATRICE AND PRINCESS EUGENIE'S ROYAL TITLES DUE TO PRINCE ANDREW: ROYAL EXPERTAccording to a very good source, the story is great political spin, but the source tells me that the king had already declined the kind offer due now to the increased work attached to his new role as king. While it appears that the new prime minister can stake claim to holding that kind of power over the new king it's not quite what it appears. Ms. Truss, of course, holds the historical record of now being the very final prime minister to meet and be asked to form a government by the late monarch which Charles was very moved by, and I hear that he and Ms. Truss get along very well after ""his mum"" gave her a great resounding reference to Charles. Even right at the very end the queen was working very hard, however the real reason is that Charles is not, and does not want to interfere with his son William's climate message via his charity Earthshot, and so he agreed with him to keep at bay.

"Wisconsin voters say inflation, climate change are among their top voting priorities ahead of midterms","Wisconsin voters sounded off on what they consider the most important issues heading into the midterm elections, with most telling Fox News that the economy and climate change were top priorities. ""Inflation is out of control,"" Matt, from Wisconsin, said. ""We gotta get gas prices down because I dont want to be paying that much at the pump."" Inflation, which nationally hit a 40-year-high of 9.1% in June, was the top issue for registered Wisconsin voters, with two-thirds saying they were ""very concerned"" about soaring prices, according to an August Marquette University survey. Gun violence and crime followed closely behind, while 41% said they were very concerned about climate change. ""Its getting kind of scary,"" London, a Democrat from Milwaukee, told Fox News, citing climate change as her top priority. She said her concerns are apparent considering the flooding following Hurricane Ian and that several regions facing severe droughts. 2022 MIDTERM ELECTION NEWS AS DEMOCRATS, GOP FIGHT TO CONTROL SENATE, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ""Its only going to get worse if we dont act on it now,"" London said.  Nearly 80% of Democratic Wisconsin voters said climate change was their top priority, according to the Marquette poll, while Republicans ranked it their lowest concern. Meanwhile, 91% of Republican voters cited inflation as their main issue, which Democrats ranked sixth.  But while climate change is a major concern for Chase, a Democrat, it wasn't his top issue. Instead, his priority is on reining in government spending to ease inflation. ""Even as a Democrat, as a moderate Democrat, Im still concerned about that,"" Chase said. ""The deficit is out of control."" BIDEN SIGNS $739 BILLION INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, SLAMS GOP FOR VOTING AGAINST THE TAX, CLIMATE DEAL ""I moved here for my first middle class job and still the cost of living as a single person is ridiculous,"" Chase continued. ""Milwaukees not even an expensive city."" Shelter costs in U.S. cities, including rent prices, rose .07% from July to August, the steepest increase since 1991, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In expensive urban areas like New York City, rents decreased by .9% over the last month but increased 12.1% compared to October 2021, according to the Apartment List. Several voters mentioned crime as their top priority.  ""In a city like this, it's almost like you have rules when you walk down the street,"" one Milwaukee resident said. ""Be careful how you look at certain people because now you cant talk to everybody."" WISCONSIN'S RISE IN CRIME CAUSED BY TONY EVERS WEAK LEADERSHIP: GOP CANDIDATE TIM MICHELS Wisconsin saw 321 homicides in 2021  nearly double the number in 2019, according to Wisconsin Department of Justice data. Some violent crimes decreased, such as a 10% drop in robberies, but aggravated assaults rose 12% over the same period.  ""Its kind of hard to feel safe anywhere,"" another voter said. ""Theres no such thing as freedom here.""  Another Wisconsin voter, Miles, said there are many issues to be addressed, but he isn't confident any candidate to fix them.  ""Not sure I trust either party to solve them,"" Miles told Fox News, saying candidates are ""just talking heads."" ""They try to do their best but they really are just out for themselves,"" Miles said.",12/10/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-voters-inflation-climate-change-top-voting-priorities-midterms
Washington Post article claims climate change fuels 'hate speech' through hotter temperatures,"Washington Post weather reporter Amudalat Ajasa wrote that researchers are worried that hotter temperatures caused by climate change are spurring a rise in ""hate speech."" In her Thursday report, titled, ""Hotter days bring out hotter tempers, research finds,"" Ajasa cited two studies that show that because of climate change, hotter temperatures are inducing people to engage in ""hate speech and hostile behavior."" Ajasa wrote, ""As temperatures around the world increase, scientists have documented large-scale environmental effects  rising sea levels, drought and famine, intense flooding and the disappearance of species. But increasingly, some researchers worry that higher temperatures might also contribute to people behaving badly."" WISCONSIN VOTERS SAY INFLATION, CLIMATE CHANGE ARE AMONG THEIR TOP VOTING PRIORITIES AHEAD OF MIDTERMS She added, ""Two recent studies add to the idea by showing that when it gets hot out, people are more prone to hate speech and hostile behavior."" According to the one of the studies, ""hate speech on social media escalated with high temperatures."" The other found that there was ""an increase in workplace harassment and discrimination at the U.S. Postal Service when the temperature eclipsed 90 degrees."" Ajasa noted that these studies are just part of a ""growing literature connecting heat to aggressive behavior."" Delving more specifically into the data, the reporter cited the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Researchs study, which found an ""increase of hate speech of up to 22 percent on Twitter when temperatures are above 107 degrees Fahrenheit."" Not only that, but ""extreme cold"" coincided with a rise in ""offensive tweets."" Ajasa noted offensive tweets saw ""a 12.5 percent increase when it was below 27 degrees."" Ajasa claimed that scientists made these findings by using ""a machine-learning algorithm to analyze 75 million hate tweets from a database containing over 4 billion tweets posted by people across the United States between 2014 and 2020. The tweets spanned 773 cities."" GREEN ENERGY PROJECTS FACE STARK ENVIRONMENTAL, LOCAL OPPOSITION NATIONWIDE The algorithm showed that ""Aggressive behavior was the tamest between 54 to 70 degrees, according to the peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Lancet Planetary Health."" It also found that ""temperatures above 81 degrees were consistently linked to significant increases in online hate across all climate zones."" Ajasa added, ""As summers get warmer and the number of heat waves increases, researchers fear that there will be an increase in online hate."" The author quoted University of Michigan associate professor Libby Hemphill to bolster the claim, who said, ""I do think that as living in a climate impacted world increases our stress and precarity, we will see increases in aggression online as well."" Hemphill, who the piece said studies ""hate speech and social media,"" added, ""It makes sense to me that climate threat would have the same impact or a similar impact to all these other types of threats that stress people out and make them lash out."" Ajasa also cited Iowa State University professor Craig Anderson, who said, ""As global warming increases, there will be, in fact already is, an increase in the frequency with which people are uncomfortably warm or uncomfortably hot. That in itself can lead to decision-making and behaviors that are more aggressive and under some circumstances can lead to increases in violent behavior."" The weather reporter concluded her piece, saying, ""Experts agree that slowing climate change could keep heat-inflamed behavior in check.""

"Climate change effects 'can begin in the womb' warns New York Times opinion piece, pushes for govt. action","Babies in the womb can be negatively affected by climate change, argued one opinion writer in The New York Times Wednesday.  The opinion piece written by Jessica Grose was headlined, ""The Effects of Climate Change Can Begin in the Womb."" Grose based her claim on a study published in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, which followed kids who lived through Hurricane Sandy while in their mother's womb, and kids who were born before or were conceived after the storm. According to the Times, the study found elevated psychological issues in kids who lived through Hurricane Sandy while in utero. ""The studys authors found that boys who were exposed to Sandy in the womb had elevated risks for ""attention-deficit/disruptive behavioral disorders,"" while girls had elevated risks for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders and phobias,"" Grose wrote. IN WAKE OF DOBBS V. JACKSON, NEW YORK TIMES COLUMN PRESENTS ABORTION AS FAMILY VALUE, MORAL GOOD The columnist searched for solutions to the problem since climate change wasnt ""going away anytime soon  even if humanity suddenly got our collective act together and started doing more to ameliorate it and pregnancies will continue to coincide with hurricanes, tornadoes and floods."" She reached out to one of the study's authors who said parents weren't to blame, and called for policymakers to ""invest in communities for children and pregnant women"" to study the long-term affects of disasters on children.  But the Times columnist called other measures simply a ""Band-Aid"" to solve the problem of climate change. She ultimately pushed for climate legislation as the solution. ""The burden cannot be on any individual to fix a problem...While, yes, we can ask for increased screening of children who are exposed to natural disasters in utero, that feels like putting a Band-Aid on a deep wound. Its an inadequate fix to a problem that will cascade over our lives, and our childrens lives, for years to come,"" Grose stated. CLIMATE FOR KIDS: CARTOON USES ANIMALS TO ADDRESS INS AND OUTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE After citing the Inflation Reduction Act, Grose suggested more aggressive legislation was needed. ""[B]ut for every delay theres another disaster, another storm flooding people out of their basement dwellings, another generation of parents left to care for children, potentially not knowing the causes of psychological issues, without the resources to deal with those issues and not enough being done to counter the trend of climate disasters,"" she concluded.  After Hurricane Ian hit Florida and South Carolina last month, some in the media used the opportunity to bring up their concerns about climate change and link it to seemingly unrelated issues. A guest essay in the paper claimed Florida was targeted by the storm because of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis hadn't taken enough measures to combat climate change. Another article in the Washington Post claimed hotter temperatures due to climate change, fueled a rise in hate speech.",19/10/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/media/climate-change-effects-begin-womb-warns-new-york-times-op-ed-pushes-govt-action

German climate change activists splash mashed potatoes on Monet painting,"A pair of activists on Sunday doused a Claude Monet painting in a German museum to protest climate change.   The two activists from the group Last Generation can be seen in a video throwing a thick substance over Monets ""Les Meules"" at Potsdams Barberini Museum, then gluing their hands to the wall below the painting. The group later confirmed that the mixture was mashed potatoes. ""We make this #Monet the state and the public the audience,"" the group later tweeted along with a video of the incident. ""If it takes a painting  with #MashedPotatoes or #TomatoSoup thrown at it  to make society remember that the fossil fuel course is killing us all: Then we'll give you #MashedPotatoes on a painting!""  In total, four people were involved in the incident, according to German news agency dpa. ANTI-OIL ENVIRONMENTALISTS POUR TOMATO SOUP ON VAN GOGH SUNFLOWERS PAINTING The Barberini Museum said later Sunday that because the painting was enclosed in glass, the mashed potatoes didn't cause any damage. The painting, part of Monet's ""Haystacks"" series, is expected to be back on display on Wednesday. ""While I understand the activists' urgent concern in the face of the climate catastrophe, I am shocked by the means with which they are trying to lend weight to their demands,"" museum director Ortrud Westheider said in a statement. Police told dpa they had responded to the incident. Last Generation tweeted later Sunday that the activists, ""Mirjam and Benjamin,"" have been taken to jail without further details. The Monet painting is the latest artwork in a museum to be targeted by climate activists to draw attention to global warming. The British group Just Stop Oil threw tomato soup at Vincent van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" in London's National Gallery earlier this month.  Just Stop Oil activists also glued themselves to the frame of an early copy of Leonardo da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" at London's Royal Academy of Arts and to John Constable's ""The Hay Wain"" in the National Gallery.

"The top issues liberal media outlets have blamed on climate change, from ISIS to hate speech","Liberal media outlets have long been infatuated with doomsday predictions about climate change, with journalists blaming a wide variety of sociopolitical issues, like hate speech and terrorism for the ongoing increase in global average temperature.  Democrats and their cohorts in the media in the media have often blamed major hurricanes, tornadoes, and other extreme weather events on climate change. But, their dire warning about the issue have also led them to blame more unconventional problems on changes to our global climate.  Effect of climate change on babies in the womb A New York Times opinion piece released last week claimed that babies in the womb can be negatively impacted by climate change, citing a study published in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. The study compared babies in utero during the storm, versus kids who were born or conceived after the storm. According to Times opinion writer Jessica Grose, the study found higher rates of psychological issues among kids who lived through the hurricane while inside the womb.  ""The studys authors found that boys who were exposed to Sandy in the womb had elevated risks for ""attention-deficit/disruptive behavioral disorders,"" while girls had elevated risks for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders and phobias,"" Grose wrote. CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS 'CAN BEGIN IN THE WOMB' WARNS NEW YORK TIMES OPINION PIECE, PUSHES FOR GOVT. ACTION The writer suggested that extensive climate legislation, much larger than the Inflation Reduction Act, was needed to combat the issue, based off the idea that climate change would continue to increase the severity and frequency of severe weather events, thus impacting pregnant women.  Possible link between climate change and hate speech A week earlier, a Washington Post article claimed that climate change was leading to a rise in ""hate speech"" incidences, spurred by hotter temperatures across the globe.  In an October 13 report, titled, ""Hotter days bring out hotter tempers, research finds,"" weather reporter Amudalat Ajasa cited two studies that show that because of climate change, extreme temperatures are inducing people to engage in ""hate speech and hostile behavior.""

CBS PUSHES STUDY BLAMING CLIMATE CHANGE FOR RISING CHILDHOOD OBESITY RATES Media publications habit of blaming climate change as the catalyst for numerous negative outcomes.  Climate change to blame for rising childhood obesity In August, CBS pushed a study blaming climate change for rising childhood obesity rates. Co-host Nate Burleson introduced the study published in the journal ""Temperature"" that argued ""climate change, specifically warmer temperatures is making our children more inactive and more obese."" Burleson said the study found that children were 30% less ""aerobically fit"" than their parents and claimed hotter temperatures were preventing kids from exercising outside. Climate change helped to strengthen ISIS, The Taliban, and more A year earlier, CBS News released a report that claimed climate change had helped strengthen the Taliban. In the report titled ""How climate change helped strengthen the Taliban,"" CBS News' climate and energy reporter Cara Korte highlighted that ""rural Afghanistan"" has been ""rocked by climate change,"" and said the Taliban has ""taken advantage"" of those who have suffered from floods and droughts that have destroyed their crops and left them hungry. The report also made note of the impact of climate change on an increase in floods in the winter, caused by the melting of snow and glaciers in the countrys northern mountains. Furthermore, the report noted that rain had increased in south and west of Afghanistan by 10-25% over the past 30 years. Such flooding had allegedly led Taliban forces to exploit and recruit Afghan farmers, who are told they could make up their lost profits by joining the group.  In recent years, concerns over how climate change could fuel conflicts have gained traction. National Geographic, in particular, often floated the idea that extreme weather, such as droughts and storms, could exacerbate economic and political turmoil in destabilizing regions.  GERMAN CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVISTS SPLASH MASHED POTATOES ON MONET PAINTING On at least three separate occasions, National Geographic floated a similar theory in regard to ISIS recruitment in Iraq, a lack of peace in Afghanistan, and the Syrian War.  Two years ago in 2020, the magazine released an article titled ""In Afghanistan, climate change complicates future prospects for peace."" Alleging that Afghanistan is one of the most vulnerable, and least equipped countries in the world to handle climate change, the papers consulted experts warned that climate change would fuel natural disasters, leading to mass displacement, child marriage, and violence.  In November 2018, National Geographic published a piece entitled ""Climate change and water woes drove ISIS Recruiting in Iraq."" The piece claimed that shifting resources, and desperate farmers were ""driven into terror recruiters clutches,"" and questioned whether such a scenario could happen again, or become worse in the future.  Just a year earlier the magazine said the refugee crisis facing the European Union could become far worse as climate change wreaks havoc on Syria, and other Eastern Mediterranean countries.  ""As warming worsens, these influxes would accelerate. Under one scenario where warming stabilizes by 2100, asylum applications could increase by some 28 percent. But in a scenario with ""business-as-usual"" warming, applications could nearly triple, to more than a million asylum seekers per yea,"" the report stated.  In a 2015 report, the magazine linked a number of droughts in Syria and South Sudan to climate change, and claimed that it had made the Syrian Civil War worse.  ""Drought, worsened by climate change, led to mass migration that helped spark the Syrian conflict, researchers say,"" the report said in part. DEMOCRATS BLAMING CLIMATE CHANGE FOR HURRICANE IAN AT ODDS WITH SCIENCE, EXPERTS SAY Climate change will cause murders, rapes, and assaults to rise: MSNBC guest The possible link between violence and climate change was also discussed by MSNBCs ""Morning Joe"" panel back in 2019. At the time, journalist and author David Wallace-Wells claimed that there was a direct correlation between rising temperatures and conflict on the planet.  ""For every half a degree of warming were expected to see a 10 or 20% increase in conflicts. So if we get to where were going by the end of the century, we could have twice as much war as we have today. And that conflict happens even at the individual levels, so well see rises in murder rates and rape, domestic assault. It spikes the rates at which people are admitted to mental hospitals,"" Wallace-Wells said.  Screenwriter says climate change could cause real life sharknado Conversations about climate change have even cropped up in media interviews related to popular entertainment. Such was the case in 2014 in a conversation between anchor Tamron Hall and screenwriter Thunder Levin.   During the interview, Hall asked Levin how he and his colleagues came up with a story as original ""Sharknado,"" to which Levin said that it was time to alert the world the perils of global warming and ""biomediaology,"" and getting facts out to everyone.  ""Because this can happen,"" Hall laughed.  ""Absolutely it can happen,"" Levin replied. It was unclear during the interview if the ""Sharknado"" creator was serious about his comments.

Fisherman believe many once-profitable species that declined with climate change may be gone for good,"Fishing regulators and the seafood industry are grappling with the possibility that some once-profitable species that have declined with climate change might not come back. Several marketable species harvested by U.S. fishermen are the subject of quota cuts, seasonal closures and other restrictions as populations have fallen and waters have warmed. In some instances, such as the groundfishing industry for species like flounder in the Northeast, the changing environment has made it harder for fish to recover from years of overfishing that already taxed the population. Officials in Alaska have canceled the fall Bristol Bay red king crab harvest and winter snow crab harvest, dealing a blow to the Bering Sea crab industry that is sometimes worth more than $200 million a year, as populations have declined in the face of warming waters. The Atlantic cod fishery, once the lifeblood industry of New England, is now essentially shuttered. But even with depleted populations imperiled by climate change, it's rare for regulators to completely shut down a fishery, as they're considering doing for New England shrimp. TWO MEN EMBROILED IN LAKE ERIE FISHING TOURNAMENT SCANDAL ENTER PLEAS TO CHARGES The Northern shrimp, once a seafood delicacy, has been subject to a fishing moratorium since 2014. Scientists believe warming waters are wiping out their populations and they won't be coming back. So the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is now considering making that moratorium permanent, essentially ending the centuries-old harvest of the shrimp. It's a stark siren for several species caught by U.S. fishermen that regulators say are on the brink. Others include softshell clams, winter flounder, Alaskan snow crabs and Chinook salmon. Exactly how many fisheries are threatened principally by warming waters is difficult to say, but additional cutbacks and closures are likely in the future as climate change intensifies, said Malin Pinsky, director of the graduate program in ecology and evolution at Rutgers University. ""This pattern of climate change and how it ripples throughout communities and coastal economies is something we need to get used to,"" Pinsky said. ""Many years are pushing us outside of what we have experienced historically, and we are going to continue to observe these further novel conditions as years go by."" While its unclear whether climate change has ever been the dominant factor in permanently shutting down a U.S. fishery, global warming is a key reason several once-robust fisheries are in increasingly poor shape and subject to more aggressive regulation in recent years. Warming temperatures introduce new predators, cause species to shift their center of population northward, or make it harder for them to grow to maturity, scientists said. GIANT 6,000-POUND SUNFISH SETS WORLD RECORD AS LARGEST BONY FISH: REPORT In the case of the Northern shrimp, scientists and regulators said at a meeting in August that the population has not rebounded after nearly a decade of no commercial fishing. Regulators will revisit the possibility of a permanent moratorium this winter, said Dustin Colson Leaning, a fishery management plan coordinator with the Atlantic States commission. Another approach could be for the commission to relinquish control of the fishery, he said. The shrimp prefer cold temperatures, yet the Gulf of Maine is warming faster than most of the world's oceans. Scientists say warming waters have also moved new predators into the gulf. But in Maine, where the cold-water shrimp fishery is based, fishermen have tried to make the case that abundance of the shrimp is cyclical and any move to shutter the fishery for good is premature. ""I want to look into the future of this. Its not unprecedented to have a loss of shrimp. We went through it in the 50s, we went through it in the 70s, we had a tough time in the 90s,"" said Vincent Balzano, a shrimp fisherman from Portland. ""They came back."" Another jeopardized species is winter flounder, once highly sought by southern New England fishermen. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has described the fish as ""significantly below target population levels"" on Georges Bank, a key fishing ground. Scientists with University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management wrote that the fish have struggled to reach maturity ""due to increased predation related to warming winters"" in a report last year. ME LOBSTER FISHERMEN'S LAWSUIT AGAINST WHALE PROTECTION RULE EXPEDITED BY FEDERAL COURT On the West Coast, Chinook salmon face an extinction risk due to climate change, NOAA has reported. Drought has worsened the fish's prospects in California, at the southern end of its range, scientists have said. Fishermen on the East Coast, from Virginia to Maine, have dug softshell clams from tidal mud for centuries, and they're a staple of seafood restaurants. They're used for chowder and fried clam dishes and are sometimes called ""steamers."" But the clam harvest fell from about 3.5 million pounds in 2010 to 2.1 million pounds in 2020 as the industry has contended with an aging workforce and increasing competition from predators such as crabs and worms. Scientists have linked the growing predator threat to warming waters. The 2020 haul in Maine, which harvests the most clams, was the smallest in more than 90 years. And the 2021 catch still lagged behind typical hauls from the 2000s, which were consistently close to 2 million pounds or more. Predicting what the clam harvest will look like in 2022 is difficult, but the industry remains threatened by the growing presence of invasive green crabs, said Brian Beal a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. The crabs, which eat clams, are native to Europe and arrived in the U.S. about 200 years ago and have grown in population as waters have warmed. ""There seem to have been, relative to 2020, a ton more green crabs that settled,"" Beal said. ""Thats not a good omen."" One challenge of managing fisheries that are declining due to warming waters is that regulators rely on historical data to set quotas and other regulations, said Lisa Kerr, a senior research scientist with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine. Scientists and regulators are learning that some fish stocks just aren't capable of returning to the productivity level of 40 years ago, she said.  Back then, U.S. fishermen typically caught more than 100 million pounds of Atlantic cod per year. Now, they usually catch less than 2 million pounds, as overfishing and environmental changes have prevented the population from returning to historical levels. The future of managing species that are in such bad shape might require accepting the possibility that fully rebuilding them is impossible, Kerr said. ""It's really a resetting of the expectations,"" she said. ""We're starting to see targets that are more in line, but under a lower overall target.""",27/10/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/us/fisherman-believe-once-profitable-species-declined-climate-change-gone-good
COP27: Thousands of global diplomats to descend upon ritzy resort town in Egypt to solve global warming,"The United Nations' latest annual climate change conference, COP27, is set to kick off Monday at the luxurious resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where thousands of leaders will engage in wide-ranging policy discussions. The conference comes one year after COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, where leaders from around the world, including nations with the highest emissions, signed a non-binding climate agreement resembling previous pacts. Shortly following the agreement, though, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres downplayed the agreement and paved the way for COP27. ""It's an important step, but it's not enough,"" he said at the time. ""It's time to go into emergency mode."" Groups, including Greenpeace International, similarly criticized the agreement, calling it a ""polite request.""  UN BRUSHES OFF CONCERNS ABOUT UPCOMING CLIMATE SUMMIT'S 'HUGE CARBON FOOTPRINT' Ahead of this year's summit, which is scheduled to begin Monday and conclude on Nov. 18, high-ranking officials in the U.S. and other Western nations have reiterated the importance of solving global warming, which they characterized as the biggest threat facing humanity. ""Among all of the centrifugal forces of these last 20 years, all vying to pull the world apart in many ways, the climate crisis still looms largest as the issue that will change life unalterably. Now, that may sound grandiose, but it is no exaggeration,"" Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, who will lead the American delegation at the event, said in October. ""Existential means existential. It demands that we all work together, because no country can resolve this crisis by itself,"" he continued. ""So its especially appropriate to be here, just 12 days before the gavel is going to come down at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh  and with it, a major accountability moment on this urgent issue."" JOHN KERRY WILL FLY COMMERCIAL TO UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE FOLLOWING BACKLASH FOR PRIVATE JET CARBON EMISSIONS  Kerry added that nations must ""repair the planet at the pace that science demands"" and increase the ability to adapt to cataclysmic global warming. Among the conference's main objectives will be to forward solutions that cut carbon emissions and limiting global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world has already warmed about one degree above pre-industrial levels, according to the U.N. ""I have no expectations for COP27 whatsoever because there's been 27 of these meetings and they haven't solved climate change in any one of them,"" Anthony Watts, a senior fellow for environment and climate at The Heartland Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""This is literally nothing more than a trade show."" ""Even with the Paris accords in 2015  they supposedly came up with a breakthrough,"" Watts added. ""Well, that breakthrough will amount to just a few hundredths of a degree of temperature drop by 2100 if everyone complies with the promises they've made and the thing is entirely voluntary. It's entirely just show and trade craft. There's no real things being accomplished here."" JUDICIAL WATCH SUES BIDEN ADMIN OVER JOHN KERRY'S TRAVEL COSTS, CALENDAR, STAFFER INFO Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow at the Energy &amp; Environment Legal Institute, noted that the U.N. has itself projected carbon emissions will increase by at least 10% by 2030, suggesting previous pledges have been relatively ineffective. ""Even if you do believe that emissions are going to destroy the world, nobody's really doing anything about it,"" he told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""So, the whole thing is just pointless."" Another priority of the conference will be to hash out additional climate finance agreements enabling developing nations to pay for complex renewable energy technologies and clean energy development. Western nations have fallen far short of a 2009 U.N. pledge to give $100 billion a year to poor countries for climate mitigation through 2025. Although the Trump administration backed out of climate finance agreements, President Biden has pledged more than $11 billion per year to the developing world for climate mitigation. A group of African and Arab countries have banded together to form the so-called COP27 Coalition ahead of the conference to issue a series of demands for wealthy nations. Among the demands, the coalition said the West should ""provide finance, technology and capacity to developing countries."" BIDEN PLEDGES TO MOBILIZE PRESIDENCY TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE: 'CODE RED FOR HUMANITY' ""We're telling developing nations that we don't want them to go through the process of developing, we don't want them to have coal or natural gas or even nuclear,"" Daniel Turner, the executive director of Power The Future, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""We want them to use wind and solar, which is intermittent, which is ineffective, which is incredibly cost prohibitive."" ""Along with climate financing is a lot of energy poverty and we're very comfortable plunging certain sectors of the world, even certain sectors of the American population, into energy poverty,"" he said. Overall, the two-week summit is expected to welcome about 40,000 participants  including 24,000 diplomats and 13,000 observers  matching last year's total, according to the U.N.  In addition to Kerry, President Biden and several top administration officials are expected to travel to Egypt for the conference. And U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reversed his decision not to attend COP27, saying climate action was essential to long-term prosperity and energy security. However, China and India, two of the world's largest emitters, are expected to send a slimmed-down delegation compared to past conferences, calling into doubt whether any agreement reached could have a significant impact. China accounts for about 27% of total global emissions  nearly tripling the total in the U.S., the world's second-largest emitter, according to Rhodium Group  and continues to approve and construct a large amount of coal power plants. CHINA HALTS MILITARY, CLIMATE TALKS WITH US IN RETALIATION FOR PELOSI VISIT ""That should be the first priority, or the maybe the first agenda item at the conference. If climate is a global issue and two of the world's largest emitters are not participating, then all the rest of our reductions, or our pledges, are absolutely meaningless,"" Turner said. ""China is bringing more coal online. They're bringing more coal online than we currently have in the United States,"" he continued. ""Why would America make any efforts to cut something like coal, when it's being completely offset, or exacerbated, by what China's doing?"" In recent months, European consumers and businesses have been hit with massive energy bills due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which upended global oil and gas markets due to Russian producers' dominance, and an aggressive transition to green energy sources like wind and solar pushed by several major European nations.  Amid the crisis, Europeans have been forced to take drastic measures to conserve energy and keep bills low while governments have imposed rationing rules and introduced relief programs. In the U.S., energy prices have surged due to a similar crisis. Home heating costs alone are expected to rise another 17.8% this winter compared to last year.  ""The green agenda is a kind of cult-like, quasi-religious movement,"" Benny Peiser, the director of the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation, told Fox News Digital. ""They will go as long as governments push that agenda and there's no indication in Europe or in the U.S. currently, that this is going to go away."" ""There is, of course, a growing realization that the energy policies in Europe over the last 20 to 30 years have been an utter disaster,"" he added. ""But are our governments, our ministers, going to acknowledge that and say, 'Sorry, we've got it wrong'? No.""",05/11/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cop27-thousands-global-diplomats-descend-ritzy-five-star-resort-egypt-solve-global-warming
COP27: delegates weigh ??limate compensation' for poor nations impacted by global warming,"As the United Nations latest annual climate change conference, COP27, kicked off Sunday in the ritzy resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, delegates from nearly 200 countries agreed to discuss compensating poor nations for damage linked to global warming.  The item managed to land on the agenda even as the international community remains distracted by the ongoing war in Ukraine and rampant inflation.  Wealthy nations at climate conferences in past years have generally ruled out discussions on ""loss and damage,"" wherein rich nations send money to poor nations to help them cope with the impacts of climate change.  At last years conference in Glasgow, the United States and the European Union blocked a proposal to establish a loss and damage financing body.  UN BRUSHES OFF CONCERNS ABOUT UPCOMING SUMMIT'S HUGE CARBON FOOTPRINT Calls to put such proposals into practice have been growing louder in recent years, particularly after devastating natural catastrophes such as flooding in Pakistan, which caused an estimated $30 billion in economic losses and left thousands of people homeless.  At the opening plenary, COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said the discussions inclusion on the agenda, ""reflects a sense of solidarity for the victims of climate disasters"" and that the talks are intended to lead to a conclusion decision ""no later than 2024.""   Still, it remains to be seen what concrete measures will be put into place in the coming years. Such an initiative would have step hurdles to raising cash, with western governments facing depleted resources to stave off inflation.",06/11/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cop27-delegates-weigh-climate-compensation-poor-nations-impacted-global-warming
"EPA wants your help spending $13B on ??nvironmental justice,??climate crisis","The Environmental Protection Agency is asking for public input on how it should spend more than $13 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act on fighting the ""climate crisis"" and advancing ""environmental justice."" The EPA announced Friday that it would be soliciting public comments on how to spend money on things like air quality and climate change projects. The $13 billion comes from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation that mostly boosted funding for the Democrats environmental and health care goals despite its name. ""The Inflation Reduction Act provides states, tribes, communities and organizations with the unprecedented opportunity to make lasting progress to equitably protect people and the planet from air pollution and climate change,"" said Joseph Goffman, principal deputy assistant administrator for EPAs Office of Air and Radiation. ""We are eager to engage with all who have a stake in the success of these efforts, and our next steps will be guided by the wisdom and experience from the conversations we have and the feedback we receive over the next several months."" EPA SPENDS $50 MILLION ON AIR MONITORING FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WITH BIDEN SPENDING BILL FUNDS EPA set up a webpage for the public on six grant programs and will collect input on these initiatives through Jan. 18, 2023. One grant program will let EPA distribute $5 billion to help states, local agencies and tribes develop and implement ""strong climate pollution reduction strategies."" Another will send $4 billion to reduce transportation emissions, including by replacing ""dirty heavy-duty vehicles with clean alternatives,"" and a third will spend $1.5 billion to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. EPA SPENDS NEARLY $1 BILLION ON ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES AMID NATIONWIDE BUS DRIVER SHORTAGE EPA has said the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden signed in August, authorized the ""largest investment to combat the climate crisis in U.S. history."" In total, the new law allows EPA to spend $41.5 billion on projects to monitor air quality, reduce pollution and support the Biden administrations goal of ""environmental justice,"" which the administration defines as getting resources to low-income and other ""marginalized"" communities that it says bears the brunt of pollution. EPA said its goal is to make sure the goals of the Inflation Reduction Act are ""realized by all people, particularly those who have been most burdened by environmental, social, and economic injustice."" In late October, EPA provided nearly $1 billion for electric school buses and focused most of that effort on low-income, rural and tribal school districts. BIDEN ANNOUNCES EXECUTIVE ACTIONS ON CLIMATE CRISIS, FOCUSES ON EXTREME HEAT AND BOOSTING OFFSHORE WIND The Biden administrations climate push has also seeped into other federal agencies. The Department of Health and Human Services runs an Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), which Republicans targeted in October as possible wasteful spending at a time when the health agency should be focused on things like the fentanyl crisis, and when the administration should be more worried about runaway spending.  ""Wasteful spending on a radical left-wing agenda is par for the course for this administration and has led to historic inflation,"" Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee wrote to HHS last month. ""It raises serious questions as to why HHS is now spending millions of taxpayer dollars and expanding the federal bureaucracy when Americans are struggling to pay their energy bills, buy gas and groceries, and pay for transportation to and from work.""",07/11/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/epa-help-spending-13b-environmental-justice-climate-crisis
Biden promises billions for ??ature-based solutions??to climate change,"The Biden administration said it will direct billions of taxpayer dollars toward ""nature-based"" climate change solutions, which includes plans for ""bringing the power of nature to maximize the value and resilience of military bases."" The White House on Tuesday released its ""Roadmap for Nature-Based Solutions to Fight Climate Change,"" which the White House says will ""put America on a path that will unlock the full potential of nature-based solutions to address climate change, nature loss, and inequity."" It said $25 billion worth of current and pending projects are already aligned toward this goal. ""Nature-based solutions"" means actions to protect or restore ecosystems that are also ""solutions to societal challenges,"" such as the conservation of natural areas that help boost resilience to flooding or heat. President Biden initiated this new effort with an executive order he signed on Earth Day this year, which directed federal agencies to pursue nature-based solutions to the climate crisis. BIDENS FINAL WEEK OF CAMPAIGNING PLAGUED WITH GAFFES: WHATS HIS NAME? One element of the roadmap calls on the Department of Defense to create a guide for ""nature-based solutions for Military Installation natural resources management planning."" That guide will ""provide military installation planners and managers with current and actionable information on the appropriate use of nature-based solutions; the current state of science and observed performance reliability; and other considerations regarding design, cost and benefits, implementation, and operations and maintenance."" Under White House direction, an early draft of this guide is due in March 2023. The plan calls for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to consider ""nature-based solutions"" as alternatives for all projects that have the potential to affect floodplains or wetlands. It said FEMA has already started to make things easier for ""disadvantaged communities"" to fund projects with ""nature-based solutions."" In addition to finding ""nature-based solutions"" for military installations, the administration said it would look for similar solutions for ""energy, the economy and national security."" For example, the administration is rating Department of Energy sites for climate sustainability and wants the department to also rate sites on environmental justice and cultural resource protection. BIDEN AVOIDS PUBLIC ELECTION DAY APPEARANCE, TAPING RADIO INTERVIEW AND CALLING 'LID' BEFORE NOON The plan asks several agencies to expand funding that will help train workers in the area of nature-based solutions, in order to ""support good jobs in federal agencies and the private sector."" To support that goal, the Department of Treasury will produce reports on ""How Climate Challenges American Household Finances."" The White House noted that federal agencies are already using funding from the 2021 infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act to fund similar priorities. These include conservation, reforestation and habitat restoration led by the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is distributing $837.5 million in grant funds and $4 billion in loan authority to improve ""energy efficiency, water efficiency, and climate resilience."" WOKE PENTAGON: CLIMATE LITERACY POLL DISTRIBUTED TO SERVICE MEMBERS, CIVILIAN DEFENSE WORKERS  John Podesta, the senior advisor to the president for clean energy innovation and implementation, presented the new White House plan at the opening of the U.S. Center at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changes Conference of the Parties.

African countries seek funding to tackle climate change,"Battling droughts, sandstorms, floods, wildfires, coastal erosion, cyclones and other weather events exacerbated by climate change, the African continent needs to adapt, but it needs funds to do so, leaders and negotiators from the continent said at the U.N. climate summit. It's one of the main priorities for the African Group of Negotiators at the summit, known as COP27, currently underway in Egypt. Ephraim Shitima, the group's chair, said Africa is keen to see the outcomes of the negotiations translated into action for the continent where millions are facing climate-related disasters. Shitima said the summit ""should provide solutions to the millions of people in the continent,"" adding that Africa needs finance to adapt to extreme weather as well as ""to facilitate just energy transition and boost renewable energy uptake."" A recent study released by the World Bank said that climate-related events will squeeze more than 132 million people into poverty worldwide with African countries losing between 10% and 15% of their GDP by 2050. COP27: DELEGATES WEIGH CLIMATE COMPENSATION' FOR POOR NATIONS IMPACTED BY GLOBAL WARMING Africa produces only 4% of the world's planet warming emissions despite making up 17% of the world's population but is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Climate finance for adapting to climate-related disasters and stopping them from getting worse remains a thorny issue at climate negotiations. A promise of $100 billion a year in climate funding is yet to be fulfilled despite being two years past its deadline. Speakers at the Africa Pavilion at the conference mulled over how to close the gap between the continent's financial needs on climate and what it actually receives, which is currently estimated by the African Development Bank to be between $160 billion and $340 billion by 2030. Earlier this week Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne called for the taxing of fossil fuel firms profits to support developing countries and small island states to adapt to climate change and move toward clean energy. ""We know they make extortionate profits,"" he said. He added that countries would seek compensation for climate harms from major polluters, known as loss and damage in climate negotiations. ""We see this loss and damage funding as a form of solidarity of nations standing with each other and as form of funding to countries that are in distress,"" Brown said. Seychelles President Wavel Ramkalawan said leaders in the Alliance of Small Island States are also seeking new finance facilities for loss and damage. ""We are definitely pushing for that,"" Ramkalawan told The Associated Press.  The Least Developing Countries group, which represents some 46 low income nations have also put money for adaptation and loss and damage among their top demands. ""COP27 must keep adaptation at the center,"" said Madeleine Sarr, the chair of the LDC group, adding that the group ""want to see how the shortfall in the $100 billion per year promise will be made up.""",11/11/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/world/african-countries-seek-funding-tackle-climate-change

FLASHBACK: Founder of climate group vandalizing famous paintings said Holocaust was 'normal event',"Roger Hallam  the founder of Just Stop Oil, a far-left British climate activist organization  once downplayed the Holocaust as a ""normal event"" and said climate change was a more serious threat. Hallam, who also founded the climate group Extinction Rebellion, said in 2019 that there were many other instances of cruelty in human history besides the Holocaust, in an interview at the time with German media outlet Die Zeit, according to The Guardian. After facing widespread criticism for the comments, Hallam noted the climate crisis was another Holocaust on a ""far greater scale."" ""The fact of the matter is, millions of people have been killed in vicious circumstances on a regular basis throughout history,"" Hallam told Die Ziet in the 2019 interview. ""They went to the Congo in the late 19th century and decimated it,"" he continued. ""[The Holocaust was] almost a normal event. Just another f---ery in human history."" BIG OIL HEIRESS FUNDING JUST STOP OIL GROUP THAT THREW SOUP ON VAN GOGH PAINTING The climate activist was then roundly condemned for the comments which critics said were insensitive and unhelpful. The German branch of his group Extinction Rebellion even ripped Hallam, tweeting that it would distance itself from his ""belittling and relativizing statements"" about the Holocaust. Hallam then backtracked, saying he did not mean to downplay the Holocaust, but he added that climate change poses a greater threat to humanity than the slaughter of millions of Jewish people in the mid-20th century. CLIMATE ACTIVISTS EMBRACE EXTREME TACTICS, VIOLENCE AS DEADLINE TO 'SAVE THE PLANET' DRAWS NEAR ""I want to fully acknowledge the unimaginable suffering caused by the Nazi Holocaust that led to all of Europe saying never again,'"" Hallam said. ""But it is happening again, on a far greater scale and in plain sight. The global north is pumping lethal levels of CO2 into the atmosphere and simultaneously erecting ever greater barriers to immigration, turning whole regions of the world into death zones."" ""That is the grim reality. We are allowing our governments to willingly, and in full knowledge of the science, engage in genocide of our young people and those in the global south by refusing to take emergency action to reduce carbon emissions."" Hallam's groups, meanwhile, have pushed for extreme measures to fight global warming and reduce emissions. Both Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion have engaged in and staged civil disobedience protests to oppose new oil leasing and energy development. Just Stop Oil has made headlines in recent months for blocking traffic in busy cities and vandalizing famous pieces of artwork in museums. Last month, two activists affiliated with the group dumped tomato soup on a Vincent van Gogh painting worth millions of dollars at a museum in London. ""You will only be successful when you break the rules and break the laws,"" Hallam wrote in an essay in April 2021. ""You will start to be successful when you throw off the outlook of life of older people.""  ""You need to realize that you are going to get harmed anyway,"" he continued. ""Putting yourself in harm's way is in fact the only way you can reduce the far greater harm coming down the line. When you act, your despair will lift in resistance to the death which is planned for you.""  Hallam implored his followers to ""keep going day after day"" and to never stop.  Just Stop Oil, however, has received major funding from Aileen Getty, an heiress to the Getty Oil fortune. Getty was the founding donor of Climate Emergency Fund, a California-based organization that funds the so-called A22 Network, an umbrella group that includes Just Stop Oil and similar civil disobedience groups in 10 countries including the U.S., Germany, France and Canada.

Poll shows religious Americans are less likely to be concerned with climate change,"Most adults in the United States  including a large majority of Christians and people who identify with other religions  consider the Earth sacred and believe God gave humans a duty to care for it. But highly religious Americans  those who pray daily, regularly attend religious services and consider religion crucial in their lives -- are far less likely than other U.S. adults to express concern about global warming. Those are among the key findings in a comprehensive report released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, which surveyed 10,156 U.S. adults from April 11 to April 17. Its margin of error for the full sample of respondents is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. The survey says religious Americans tend to be less concerned about climate change for several reasons. JASON MOMOA SLAMMED IN FULL-PAGE USA TODAY AD FOR CLIMATE HYPOCRISY: 'MORE SCIENCE-FICTION THAN REAL' ""First and foremost is politics: The main driver of U.S. public opinion about the climate is political party, not religion,"" the report says. ""Highly religious Americans are more inclined than others to identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, and Republicans tend to be much less likely than Democrats to believe human activity (such as burning fossil fuels) is warming the Earth or to consider climate change a serious problem."" Responding to the findings, the Rev. Richenda Fairhurst, steward of climate at the non-profit Circle Faith Future, said the siloed culture in America sows further division instead of inspiring teamwork. ""I don't know who that serves,"" she said. ""But it's not serving the community  and it's certainly not serving the planet."" The poll found that about three-quarters (74%) of religiously affiliated Americans say the Earth is sacred. A larger share, (80%), feel a sense of stewardship -- and fully or mostly agree with the idea that ""God gave humans a duty to protect and care for the Earth, including the plants and animals."" REPUBLICANS ARE PLANNING TO BATTLE BIDEN'S 'RADICAL' GREEN AGENDA WITH HOUSE CONTROL: 'KEEP ENERGY COSTS LOW' Religious Americans who show little or no concern about climate change also say ""there are much bigger problems in the world, that God is in control of the climate, and that they do not believe the climate is actually changing."" Many religious Americans are also concerned about the potential consequences of environmental regulations, including the loss of individual freedoms, fewer jobs or increased energy prices, the report says. The survey also found that two-thirds of U.S. adults who are religiously affiliated say their faiths scriptures include lessons about the environment, and about four-in-ten say theyve prayed for the environment in the past year. The views, the report says, are common across a range of religious traditions. Three-quarters of both evangelical Protestants and members of historically Black Protestant churches say the Bible includes lessons about the environment. Eight in ten U.S. Catholics and mainline Protestants say the Earth is sacred and so do 77% of non-Christian religions, according to the poll. But Christians, and more broadly, religiously affiliated Americans, are divided in their views about climate change, the report says. Those who consider climate change ""an extremely or very serious problem"" range from 68% of adults who identify with the historically Black Protestant tradition, to 34% of evangelical Protestants. In none of the major Protestant traditions did a majority say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity; only 32% of evangelicals felt that way. The report says the religiously unaffiliated -- the fastest-growing group in surveys asking Americans about their religious identity  are much more likely to say that climate change is an extreme or very serious problem (70%) than religiously affiliated Americans (52%). Commonly known as the ""nones,"" they describe themselves as atheists, agnostics or ""nothing in particular."" The report says they are far more likely to say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human-induced activity (66%) than those who are religiously affiliated (47%). LEFT-WING GREEN AGENDA BACKED BY JOHN KERRY WOULD BE 'DISASTER' FOR DEVELOPING WORLD, EXPERTS SAY The survey offers clues as to why religious Americans are less likely to care about climate change than those with no religion despite seeing a link between their beliefs and caring for the environment:  For U.S. congregations, climate change doesnt seem to be a major focus. The report says that among all U.S. adults who attend religious services at least once or twice per month, only 8% say they ""hear a great deal or quite a bit about climate change in sermons.""  One in five say they hear some discussion of the topic from the pulpit.  And just 6% of American congregants say they talk about climate change with other people at their congregation a great deal or quite a bit. Highly religious Americans are also less likely to view inefficient energy practices as morally wrong, the report says. This same pattern is also seen when asked about eating food that takes a lot of energy to produce.  The Rev. Fletcher Harper, an Episcopal priest, and executive director of GreenFaith, a global multi-faith environmental organization based in New York, said he was not surprised by the findings since he doesn't see culturally and politically conservative Americans prioritizing climate action. ""What this study doesnt tell us, though, is the role that religion, when utilized effectively, can play in moving people who are concerned but inactive into public action on the climates behalf,"" Harper said. ""This warrants further research so that we can all understand better what positive role religion can play in the fight against climate change.""",17/11/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/us/poll-shows-religious-americans-less-likely-concerned-climate-change
UN negotiators agree to pay climate reparations to poor nations,"Representatives and negotiators from nearly 200 countries have reached a historic agreement to pay reparations to poor countries said to be victimized by climate change, though proponents say more is needed to scale back fossil fuels.  The deal, gaveled around dawn in the Egyptian Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, established a fund for what negotiators call ""loss and damage."" It was a big win for poorer nations that have long called for money  sometimes viewed as ""reparations""  because they are often the victims of floods, droughts, heat waves, famines and storms despite having contributed little to the pollution that heats up the globe. While the fund would be largely aimed at the most vulnerable nations, there would be room for middle-income countries severely battered by climate disasters to get aid. Details of the fund have yet to be worked out. It will likely be a major topic at next year's climate conference in the United Arab Emirates in 2023. So far, only a few nations have made significant pledges for payments. POLL SHOWS RELIGIOUS AMERICANS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE CONCERNED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE The fund would initially draw on contributions from developed countries and other private and public sources, such as international financial institutions. While major emerging economies such as China  the second-largest economy in the world and the top emitter  wouldn't automatically have to contribute, that option remains on the table. This was a key demand by the European Union and the United States. They argue that China and other large polluters currently classified as developing countries have the financial clout and responsibility to pay their way. Environment officials in developing nations hailed Sundays development as an investment in the future and a ""win for our entire world."" Others, particularly EU officials, expressed disappointment that attendees failed to make more robust commitments to scaling back fossil fuels and cutting emissions.  While the new agreement doesn't ratchet up calls for reducing emissions, it does retain language to keep alive the global goal of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Next year's talks will also see further negotiations to work out details of the new loss and damage fund, as well as review the world's efforts to meet the goals of the Paris accord.

GREG GUTFELD: Climate change activists 'win over no one' with these stunts,"Happy Tuesday, everybody. It's great to see every one of you except for you over there. So, once again, protesters attacked expensive pieces of art. And no, I'm not talking about my quads, though they are pricey and worth it. This time it's an Andy Warhol in Milan, Italy. On Friday, the attention-seeking freaks threw flour on a sports car painted by the pop artist in 1979. Pop artist. Fortunately, the Italian police sprang into action and formed it into a pizza crust. But the event is just another in a trend by young psychotics who vandalize art with food or paint. Although such actions might improve a Jackson Pollock. A little art humor there for all you sophisticates. And does anybody else find it ironic? The one piece of art they don't throw soup on is this one. I guess it's redundant. Now, every time we report on this, I get a little angry. But then again, I'm 5'5"", so what other kind of angry can I get? But the whole point - I am. But the whole point of this vandalism is to get suckers like me to report on their cause. So let's ignore the cause. I don't even know what it is. I don't know what it is. Instead, let's focus on the freaks who destroy their cause with each stunt, they win over no one. GREG GUTFELD: TWITTER'S PREVIOUS REIGNING CHAMPION IS BACK For every painting they attack, I'll eat another cow. Hell, I might even push one out of my coal-powered jet. No, but it's going to be great. That sound they make when they land, yeah. But the big story here, it's not just gender that's no longer binary. It's sanity. Those people breaking these laws appear to be certifiable. Look at them. They're madness personified. They're sad, and they're gross. If they didn't spend their time throwing vegan corn chowder on Mona Lisa's ****, they'd have no lives at all. In the old days, they'd be carted off, placed in comfy cells with padded walls. Kat knows what I'm talking about. You know, thank God I helped her get it straight. You're welcome, Kat. But now they're not even bumrushed by security. Judging by how little effort these guards make, you'd think they weren't protecting a Warhol, but this. I can draw Binky. In fact, you've got to wonder if these aren't inside jobs. I mean, who lets people into a gallery while they're carrying containers of flour or paint cans? Not that art museum guards should be SEAL Team Six, but if you see a bunch of nose ring green hairs carrying bags of flour or cans of soup or paint, you can bet they aren't there to smile back at the Mona Lisa. Insanity used to be easily defined, but now we've redefined unstable behavior as passionate. But you know who else was passionate about the environment? Charles Manson and his passionate family of human scum. Before, we used to look at these people and say, ""Well, that's one point of view."" Now relax while some men in white coats chase you with a giant butterfly net. Remember those nets? Those are great.  Now it's, ""Wow, they're so dedicated. Let's hear them out. They must really believe in this cause to scream in strangers faces and smear poop on the walls."" Or maybe they're just getting ready to host ""Jesse Waters Primetime."" That's all you need to do. So we're now at the mercy of scammers and mentally damaged people. These are desperate, isolated souls with no real sense of the world, and they're gaining traction. Joe Biden and his pals at the UN climate conference has agreed to pay up to $1 billion in so-called climate reparations to poor nations for damage apparently caused by the West's fossil fuel use.  Yeah, let's apologize for raising the standard of living for 90% of the human population on the planet and be punished by the 10% who couldn't keep up. Sorry world for the AC, the combustion engine, irrigation systems, sewage treatment plants, dishwashers, electricity. So here's a couple billion while you continue to burn things far worse than coal. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP And here's the kicker. The world's biggest emitter doesn't have to pay a dime. And no, not Eric Swalwell. It's communist China. And why? Because it's still considered a developing nation. Yeah, that makes real sense. Calling China developing nation is like calling Dolly Parton a developing female.  But let's face it, China is smarter than us. They don't buy into this progressive ****. They don't see sex as non-binary. As a matter of fact, they see the world as binary as the computer technology they steal from us. They see the world as ones and zeros. And they're the ones and everybody else are zeros. And they laugh at us for falling for this crap. So we've now embraced insanity as an alternative lifestyle. It's the elimination of standards. The destruction of beauty, whether it's in art or one's own body. Activists destroy priceless paintings as easily as they butcher their own healthy bodies. It's like our society is experiencing a sort of a mental illness as a whole.  Before, if someone couldn't participate in civilized life, we'd get them help. Now, we can't even say who's mentally ill at all. Which might be the new definition of crazy. And most of this stuff is coming out of Tik-Tok. And who owns that? China. It's a brilliant strategy.

White House to study releasing aerosols into the atmosphere to counter climate change,"The White House plans to study spraying aerosols such as sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to counter climate change  a strategy some scientists view as a risky intervention in the atmosphere but that others think may be a useful last resort to prevent global warming. This practice, called geoengineering, aims to reflect the suns radiation from the stratosphere back into space to minimize rising temperatures. The White House five-year plan was authorized by Congress this year and is being executed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Department of Energy. Researchers are split on whether the risks of geoengineering outweigh the rewards, mostly due to a lack of information on the subject. BIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY TOOK MEETING WITH BILL GATES IMMEDIATELY AFTER SENATE CONFIRMATION Daniel Cohan, associate professor for civil and environmental engineering at Rice University, said there are more natural, safe and impactful ways to counter climate change than geoengineering. But he added that additional studies on the topic can reveal the exact magnitude of its cooling benefits and climate risks. ""It seems likely that these techniques could be developed to offset much of the warming that is expected in the decades ahead,"" Cohan told Fox News Digital. ""But how it would affect regional weather patterns is highly uncertain, and thats likely where there would be huge winners and losers."" This form of geoengineering involves aircraft releasing aerosols in the atmosphere where they can partially reflect the suns radiation. The White House project will not include flying planes but instead study potential impacts. The hypothesis has its roots in documented instances of volcanic eruptions leading to notable decreases in temperatures in the surrounding area. ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST MEGHAN MARKLE SEEN BOARDING PRIVATE JET FOLLOWING FEMALE EMPOWERMENT EVENT Harvard professor David Keith said there is a growing case for research efforts that explore the exact impact of geoengineering. ""Use of geoengineering will never be necessary  its a hard choice one on which people will have divergent views,"" Keith told Fox News Digital. ""My hope is that the U.S. government comes out with a transparent, high-quality research plan that can advance knowledge in the public interest."" Diana Furchtgott-Roth, the director of the Center on Energy, Climate, and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, said she is in full support of the White Houses research because an effective geoengineering model would be far more affordable than current efforts to counter climate change such as environmental regulations and renewable energy. ""This has potentially very large benefits with a much smaller cost,"" Furchtgott-Roth told Fox News Digital.  US PROPOSES MEASURES TO LIMIT METHANE LEAKS CAUSED BY OIL DRILLING The downside of geoengineering, several experts note, is that the released aerosols only impact a limited area and must be renewed at a rapid pace to continue a reflection of the sun. Potential risks included unintentionally cooling farms that need the sun to grow crops, as well as intensified storms. Benji Backer, the president of the American Conservation Coalition, said the Biden administration is better off focusing on more environmentally friendly policies.  ""One of the worst ways to mess with a change in our weather is by trying to create more changes in the weather,"" Backer told Fox News Digital. ""The climate change dilemma certainly requires solutions that improve our air quality and overall level of pollution, but what we don't need is over-corrective research that attempts to play the hand of God.""",02/12/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-study-counter-climate-change-releasing-aerosols
Bill Maher skewers young environmentalists blaming elders for climate change: 'Using cars as much as we did!',"On his ""Club Random""podcast, HBO host Bill Maher went after the progressive, environmental left, calling their criticism of older generations hypocritical and saying he wasnt going to be the ""schmuck driving the three-dollar car"" in order to fight climate change. Talking to fellow comedian Dana Carvey, Maher knocked the idea of wealthy environmentalists forgoing the use of private jets: ""I say this now: The only people who dont fly private are the ones who cant. Anyone who can, would.""  Maher said he didn't want to be the only one making sacrifices to save the planet, something needs to be done ""as a group of humans"" for the problem to be solved, but it's been all talk and no action. ""I just dont feel like me [not flying private] is making a difference,"" he added. ""We either do this as a group - Im just not going to be the one schmuck not enjoying my life.""  BILL MAHER SAYS BIDEN'S FAR LEFT PANDERING MAKES IT HARD TO 'CONVINCE' CENTRIST DEMOCRATS TO VOTE FOR HIM Highlighting Gen Z environmentalist Greta Thunberg, the host declared her to be an exception as she wont fly in private jets: ""Shes not representative of her generation who love to blame us.""  Maher summarized young environmentalists' criticism of their elders as ""you wrecked the world!"" Then retorted, ""Yeah, like you're doing it differently. You're not driving? Right. You're just with Greta on a sailboat all the time. You're using cars as much as we did. So, shut the f--- up!""  He jokingly said, ""We're all decided that were just going to drive over the Grand Canyon and have a great time on our way. And as long as that's what we decided, Im not going to be the schmuck driving the three-dollar car.""  Comedian Carvey joined in, dismissing Thunberg with his ""three-word"" impersonation: ""How dare you? How dare you?""  BILL MAHER MOCKS DEM OBSESSION WITH NON-WHITE, NON-MALE CANDIDATES AMID 2024 CHATTER: 'SORRY GAVIN NEWSOM' Carvey offered a middle ground take on the whole discussion, saying of humanity's solutions: ""We're going to try to get to the renewables when they're practical and they can take over for fossil fuels.""  But for now, Carvey offered, ""Everyone's a Republican when the lights go out, right?""  Maher concluded the discussion by pointing out developing nations like India find American environmentalists to be unreasonable in their demands. He imagined them saying, ""Wait, you used [the resources] and now we cant have air conditioning?"" On last weeks podcast, Maher again took on his fellow liberals, saying some of them are ""crazy"" for saying that men can get pregnant. He dismissed the whole idea as a ""Ripleys Believe It or Not"" joke.

The Dark Ages are back in Europe and the climate change lobby is loving the return to chaos and control,"Politico Europe, a publication marinated in green politics, has named Russian President Vladimir Putin as one of its ""power players of the year"" -- for, in the publication's words, ""advancing Europe's green agenda."" ""By invading Ukraine and manipulating energy supplies to undermine European support for Kyiv, Putin has achieved something generations of green campaigners could not -- clean energy is now a fundamental matter of European security,"" the news outlet explained approvingly. It went on to note that Putin ""invaded Ukraine after the EU had spent two years laying the foundations of its Green Deal program for zeroing out emissions by 2050. That meant the policy machinery for a total remake of the European energy economy was already moving. All it needed was a nudge."" PROTESTS AND STRIKES ERUPT ACROSS EUROPE AS SOARING INFLATION, COST OF LIVING DRIVES 'WINTER OF DISCONTENT' You would have to be pretty severely afflicted with Climate Change Derangement Syndrome to celebrate a silver lining in Putin's murderous attack on Ukraine. Meanwhile, Europe has sprinted so far ahead of the United States in its quest to end the use of fossil fuels that many U.S. politicians, environmentalists and media voices look on with envy. But how is Europe's Green New Deal going now that Putin has given it ""a nudge""? So far, the results are, to say the least, unencouraging. Euroland has been thrust into an epic energy crisis with electricity rationing, power outages, $10 a gallon gas and citizens encouraged by governments to use candles for lights and burning wood for heating purposes.  Germany is reopening shuttered nuclear plants to avoid perpetual blackouts. It's a return to the Dark Ages in Europe -- and the climate change lobby is loving the return to chaos and mayhem. PROTECT US MILITARY INSTALLATIONS FROM PRYING EYES: DEFENSE FUNDING BILL TAKES CHINA THREAT SERIOUSLY This might be a slight exaggeration, but not much of one. The government in France has now warned of acute energy shortages this winter with drastic steps to conserve. As one publication put it, Paris, the City of Lights, may have to turn off the lights in the weeks and months ahead if it's a cold winter. Officials in Paris have decreed that local authorities must prepare power outage plans ""that would reduce consumption of electricity by up to 38%."" Wait, there's more: ""The French government said it was working alongside the Ministry of Education to develop plans to close schools in the mornings if the area is to be impacted by rolling blackouts.""  It sounds to me like climate change is the new COVID-19 for militant lockdowns and curfews. SWEDEN TOUTS NUCLEAR ENERGY AS REMEDY TO RUSSIAN DEPENDENCE, HIGH PRICES: 'A DIRE SITUATION' Germany's energy shortage is so severe that one of the fastest-growing energy sectors is coal. That's because the Germans have declared war on natural gas, so because of the self-inflicted energy crisis, they are forced to use an energy source that emits more greenhouse gases. Wood is also becoming a major source of heating homes. The Dark Ages are back. Then there is the calamity that is unfolding in Switzerland. This is a country that is anything but a heavy-handed socialist state, but now thanks to the ""energy state of emergency,"" which is the norm in Europe, the Swiss government has announced it will ban the use of electric cars for ""nonessential"" journeys. At the same time, it is encouraging people to take the train to shop for their groceries, but it has admitted that train service may also be disrupted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER That's not all. The government is also drawing up plans for dealing with blackouts that include reducing store hours by up to two hours per day, heating systems in nightclubs to be turned off and other buildings to be heated to no more than 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Online streaming services and game consoles could be banned. Christmas lights might be turned off, and all sports stadiums and leisure facilities could be closed. Is Europe turning into a third-world banana republic? All of this brings us to a stark reality. Europe has gone all-in on wind and solar power, and the experiment has failed miserably. These fringe energy sources don't work and aren't scalable for industrial economies. And the more it doesn't work, the more it requires police state interventions with fascistic controls over the economy and personal behavior.  All of these assaults on freedom and prosperity are in the name of saving the planet. One wonders if this is the real endgame objective. The old saying that the greens are the new reds (communists) is proving to be all too true. It's a future that only tyrants like ""man of the year"" Putin could love.  Worst of all, President Joe Biden's administration and green groups look to Europe as a sterling silver model for America. Biden's climate henchmen even want to move to the left of Europe on climate change controls on our economy. Biden boasted at the climate conference in Egypt last month that he wants the U.S. to sprint ahead of the Europeans on climate controls as if there is virtue in imposing pain and lowing living standards on the public. In other words, we are speeding over the same cliff of energy poverty, power outages and climate lockdowns that have crashed and burned everywhere else. The calamity is staring in front of us. And the Biden administration is saying faster, faster.

AOC climate change documentary earns only $80 per theater despite rave critic reviews,"New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezs new climate change documentary debuted in movie theaters over the weekend, generating an abysmal $80 per theater. The new film, ""To the End,"" was filmed over four years and follows four young women, Cortez, activist Varshini Prakash, climate policy writer Rhiana Gunn-Wright and political strategist Alexandra Rojas, as they attempt to pass sweeping climate change legislation in Congress. The film currently boasts an 88% ""fresh"" critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and does not yet have an audience score. AOC, CORI BUSH ANGER FELLOW SOCIALISTS BY VOTING YES ON RAILROAD WORKER DEAL ""Representative Ocasio-Cortez offers the best onscreen antidote to despair  shes funny, a canny political strategy,"" Teo Bugbee of the New York Times wrote. ""To the End is set to ignite more Americans to take action,"" RogertEbert.coms Nick Allen wrote in his review. The documentary debuted on more than 120 screens over the weekend but garnered less than $10,000 dollars across all theaters, coming in 33rd place overall at the box office. Several Oscar-bait films lauded during film festivals have struggled to excel in theaters this year, with critics attributing the audience drop-off to the rise in streaming platforms, audiences increasing distrust in critic scores, and topics that do not interest a large swathe of the public. The latter factor may have been the largest contributor to the films meager earnings, with climate change documentaries in the last several years failing to draw in a substantial audience. NEW YORK REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ UNDER INVESTIGATION BY HOUSE ETHICS COMMITTEE Earlier this year, ""The Territory,"" a National Geographic film about indigenous people fighting effects of climate change, earned less than $70,000 throughout its entire run in theaters. Rachel Lears and Robin Blotnick, the creators of ""To the End,"" previously made ""Knock Down the House,"" which revolved around the 2018 congressional primary campaigns of Cortez, Amy Vilela, Cori Bush, Paula Jean Swearengin and four other progressive Democrats. While the ""Knock Down the House"" documentary garnered praise from movie critics, certified with a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, the public had a very different opinion on the project, with a score sitting at 11%. One audience member called the film a ""knocked down drag out snooze fest,"" while others knocked the film for its ""extremely polarizing message.""  ""I feel like I must have watched a completely different movie than the ones [the critics] watched,"" one viewer said. ""It was absolutely terrible, and it actually made me dislike Alexandria Cortez after it was all over. I now see the audience score and I would say it is much more accurate compared to the critics.""

CBS News called out for claiming airplane turbulence is result of climate change: 'Typical',"The ""Outnumbered"" panelists took aim at CBS News Tuesday after the media outlet credited climate change for severe turbulence on a recent flight bound for Hawaii.  Dr. Nicole Saphier, a Fox News medical contributor, warned the issue shouldnt be ""chalked up"" to climate change without solid evidence. CBS raised eyebrows with a quote from Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, after 36 passengers were injured and 11 hospitalized due to turbulence.  ""Severe weather increases chances of turbulence, and due to climate change, these kinds of incidents will only continue to grow,"" Garland said. Saphier, however, pushed back on the claims.  MAJOR ECO GROUP SAW LARGE FUNDING UPTICK FUELED BY LIBERAL DARK MONEY NETWORK: BEST YEAR EVER ""I don't think the spokesperson for the Flight Attendants Association Union should be the climate change czar,"" she told panelists Tuesday. ""Turbulence happens all the time. It's happened since we've invented flying. And thankfully, it's actually gotten better because of the technology on the airplanes."" Jimmy Failla, host of ""Fox Across America,"" noted the curious lack of data to support the claim that climate change will make turbulence worse. ""The only data we have to support climate change is that people are getting rich selling it to us, and none of the people making that money are adhering to any of the guidelines they're forcing on us,"" Failla said.  ""The reason people fall for this garbage is because they want to sound empathetic and considerate."" TUCKER CARLSON: THESE CLIMATE ACTIVISTS ARE FRAUDULENT Twitter users immediately responded to CBS News' claims, roasting the outlet for using a union official's statement as evidence.  Tammy Bruce, a Fox News contributor, sounded off on the flight attendant union for pushing blame onto climate change. ""This is a union entity reinforcing a government-Democrat narrative,"" Bruce said.   Bruce criticized organizations for turning things like airplane turbulence into a broader political issue, and she argued it will ultimately lead to more funding for the union.

Bill Gates warns climate change will create 'dramatically worse' world for our grandchildren,"Billionaire Bill Gates warned in a blog post on Tuesday that climate change will create a ""dramatically worse"" world for ""our grandchildren.""  Gates argued that the solution to climate change can be summed up in two sentences.  ""We need to eliminate global emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. Extreme weather is already causing more suffering, and if we dont get to net-zero emissions, our grandchildren will grow up in a world that is dramatically worse off,"" he wrote.  Gates also wrote that it would be one of the hardest things humans have ever done.

Gates wrote that emissions ""rose from 51 billion tons of carbon equivalents to 52 billion tons"" between 2021 and 2022, but that the world was further along on ""getting companies to invest in zero-carbon breakthroughs."" The billionaire Microsoft co-founder added that buildings were a surprising source of carbon emissions.  ""The energy they use for air conditioning, heating, lights, and so on is responsible for nearly 14% of all greenhouse gases.

Here?? how government can fight climate change and achieve energy independence,"In politics, there often seems to be little we can agree on. Increasingly, however, Americans are inching toward consensus on what was once a hot-button issue: climate change. Recent polling from my organization, the American Conservation Coalition, in partnership with pollster Frank Luntz, shows that voters ranked climate change second as the ""most urgent crisis"" to address on the heels of midterm elections  just behind affordability.   Polling also shows that Americans were vocal in supporting investments in renewable energy and the expansion of nuclear power. While these measures are certainly worth pursuing, theres a roadblock: permitting reform.   In laymans terms, permitting reform refers to the process by which construction and development projects receive government approval and necessary permits. The current permitting process for new energy projects is slow, cumbersome, and often ineffective. It hinders the growth and development of clean energy technologies, with an average review time of 4.5 years and added costs to the tune of millions. Reform efforts aim to streamline the process so that projects can be completed more quickly and at a lower cost.   OR BANS SALES OF NEW GAS-FUELED VEHICLES BY 2035 The unfortunate reality is that the term means very little to the everyday American.   While not the most popular or exciting, this wonky policy topic is an essential solution to a challenge that is top of mind for most Americans. You wont see a protest sign demanding ""permitting reform now"" alongside ""end fossil fuels"" at a march or rally anytime soon. Still, the approach aligns with what Americans want: a balance between economic priorities and environmental concerns.   Republicans, specifically, should support permitting reform efforts as part of their commitment to free market principles and American competitiveness. After all, in the greatest country in the world, we must build cleaner, faster. The United States is a hub for innovation and cutting-edge technology, and we also have some of the highest environmental standards in the world. By streamlining our permitting process, we can create a more-efficient system that will help pave the way for a more sustainable and prosperous future.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  On one hand, streamlining regulations can help to stimulate economic growth. Through regulatory certainty, permitting reform makes it easier for businesses to develop clean energy projects. This drives investment and innovation into the sector, in turn creating jobs for American workers. But job creation isnt the only economic benefit to permitting reform  by reducing red tape and bureaucracy, its easier for energy companies to operate and compete, ultimately driving down costs for consumers.   On the other hand, these economic advantages come coupled with environmental benefits. Most obviously, increased domestic production means reducing emissions. While promoting energy independence, we can reduce our reliance on foreign nations. By fostering the growth of domestic clean technologies, we can improve our energy security and reduce our vulnerability to global market fluctuations.   The current permitting process for new energy projects is slow, cumbersome, and often ineffective. It hinders the growth and development of clean energy technologies, with an average review time of 4.5 years and added costs to the tune of millions.  Policy opportunities that bring together both sides of the aisle are rare, yet they are what Americans want. When asked what type of change respondents want to see in Washington and Congress, 40% called for common-sense solutions, while only 15% called for transformational change. When the prospect of collaboration presents itself, we must seize the opportunity.  Overall, permitting reform is a rare win-win for both the economy and the environment. To address climate change, we need to streamline permitting now  progressives, liberals, moderates and conservatives should all be on board. If not, our climate goals will remain just that: goals.",23/12/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/heres-how-government-can-fight-climate-change-achieve-energy-independence
"Liberal media made slew of dubious claims about climate change, year-end report finds","The Associated Press took $8 million in donations to fund climate coverage in 2022, with the news cooperative and several other major media publications engaged in dubious claims about climate change, according to a new, exclusive year-end report.  The ""Climate Fact Check 2022"" report, presented by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), the Heartland Institute, the Energy &amp; Environmental Legal Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and the International Climate Science Coalition (ICSC), stated that ""climate alarmists"" and members of the media engaged in claims about the relationship between manmade emissions and natural disasters, claims that clashed with ""reality and science."" In February, the Associated Press admitted that they would assign more than 24 journalists across the globe to cover ""climate issues"" after receiving more than $8 million over three years from various organizations. BIDEN TURNS TO COUNTRY WITH DOCUMENTED CHILD LABOR ISSUES FOR GREEN ENERGY MINERAL SUPPLIES: 'IT'S EGREGIOUS' The organizations contributing to the ""philanthropy-funded news"" via a ""climate grant"" are the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Quadrivium, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Walton Family Foundation. AP News Vice President Brian Carovillano only accepts money ""without strings attached"" and asserted that funders have no influence on the stories conducted. Similarly, in March 2021, high-ranking State Department officials discussed a proposal to sponsor foreign journalists to ""have experiences that educate them on reporting on climate change,"" according to emails obtained by Protect the Public's Trust (PPT) and shared with Fox News Digital. Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow at the Energy &amp; Environment Legal Institute, told Fox News Digital that the Associate Press has essentially become a ""propaganda outfit"" for liberal organizations with climate agendas. ""Its hard to claim its news when youre being paid to report only one side of the climate discourse,"" he said. WH ADVISER JOHN PODESTA STAFFING UP WITH FAR-LEFT CLIMATE ACTIVISTS: 'NEED TO SET AMBITIOUS GOALS' The report pointed to a recent article from the Associated Press, by reporter Seth Borenstein, called ""New abnormal: Climate disaster damage down to $268 billion,"" as proof of bias.  The article attributed flooding in Pakistan, Hurricane Ian, droughts in Europe, China and Africa, as well as deadly heat waves across the world to climate change. ""Weather disasters, many but not all of them turbocharged by human-caused climate change, are happening so frequently that this years onslaught, which 20 years ago would have smashed records by far, now in some financial measures seems a bit of a break from recent years,"" Borenstein wrote. The Climate Fact Check report questioned whether climate activists and ""media mouthpieces"" could legitimately attribute disaster damages to climate change or if they were merely trying to ""surf human tragedy"" to advance a political agenda. The report also highlighted several other climate claims from major media corporations, providing fact-checks for articles written by the Washington Post, New York Times and more. In August, Times reporter Derrick Bryson Taylor claimed that Britains brief heatwaves this summer were worsened by climate change. A fact-check from the report noted that heat waves have dramatically declined in duration and frequency in the U.S. over the past 90 years, according to the National Climate Assessment. JOHN KERRY SAYS GREEN ENERGY TRANSITION ISN'T HAPPENING FAST ENOUGH: 'EVERYTHING HAS TO ACCELERATE' Furthermore, the report claimed it was ""unlikely"" that emissions are increasing heat waves in Britain because hotter temperatures in the U.K. were offset by cooling elsewhere. Additionally, meteorologist Cliff Mass said that while heat waves may bring temperatures 30 to 40 degrees above the norm, global warming is only in the noise level of 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit. The Washington Post in November published a piece by Barry Svrluga with the headline ""In this World Cup ski season, climate change is winning."" The piece claimed that climate change had led to shorter winters and made it so warm that only one of eight races was able to be held as of mid-November. A fact-check of the claim found that when the World Cup skiing started in the 1960s, the season began in January. However, now it begins in October. ""If the competition began in the winter everything would likely be okay because wintertime snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing since the 1960s, the report claimed.   Milloy said that such claims have long been a part of the 30 years of ""climate hysteria"" cultivated by liberal media networks and have little to show for their dire predictions. ""Instead of moving on to something else, theyre doubling down on this, and theyre making themselves look worse at the same time,"" he added.",27/12/2022,https://www.foxnews.com/media/liberal-media-dubious-claims-climate-change-year-end-report
WaPo torched for 'nonsense' piece linking domestic violence to climate change,"The Washington Post took harsh criticism after a recent op-ed linked climate change to domestic violence. ""Outnumbered"" panelists sounded off on the liberal outlets ""nonsense"" conclusion, warning it diminishes the seriousness of abuse.  Terry McGovern, head of the Population and Family Health department at Columbia University, claimed in the op-ed that worsening climate conditions are to blame for increasing violence.  ""Heat waves, floods, climate-induced disasters increase sexual harassment, mental and physical abuse, femicide, reduce economic and educational opportunity and increase the risk of trafficking due to forced migration,"" McGovern wrote.  MYSTERIOUS ECO GROUP IS FUNDING LOCAL CLIMATE JOURNALISM: ADVOCACY DRESSED UP AS NEWS REPORTING Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe questioned why the left is so eager to link issues to climate change.  ""Turbulence on a plane, gun violence, everything is being attributed to climate change. And then now this, domestic abuse,"" she told the ""Outnumbered"" panel. ""Why is there this effort by the left, by the media, to draw a linear connection to climate change on essentially every issue?"" Martha MacCallum, anchor of ""The Story,"" noted that climate change is the top issue being discussed across the Americas, with former Pentagon officials even calling it a threat to national security.  LIBERAL MEDIA MADE SLEW OF DUBIOUS CLAIMS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, YEAR-END REPORT FINDS She said labeling issues as a result of climate change is a convenient way to bring peoples attention to the topic but argued it has unfortunate consequences for people who have been affected by real problems. ""It siphons off what their issue is, what they're suffering from,"" MacCallum said. She explained that increases in domestic violence are also seen during times of war or when people are suffering economically. ""It feels a bit disingenuous to say the least,"" she argued. ""Outnumbered"" co-host Emily Compagno argued the real cause of domestic violence is ineffective laws and enforcement, which receives less attention when the focus is on climate change. ""The travesty to me is that The Washington Post publishes this op ed, this nonsense, and takes that space away from actual arguments, from actual facts,"" she said.   Compagno encouraged people to start with state and local laws if they want to advocate for change. She stressed the difficulty in obtaining a restraining order and noted that many people who commit violence against their partner were already known to law enforcement.  ""Climate change?

Kamala Harris mocked for repeating several word salads during climate crisis talk: 'WTF is her deal',"Vice President Kamala Harris gave a series of familiar word salads and comments during her latest appearance in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Thursday. Harris was joined by Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and University of Michigan professor Kyle Whyte at the universitys Rackham Auditorium to discuss further efforts to combat the climate crisis. However, over the course of the discussion, Harris made several statements which triggered the memories of many Twitter users. The vice president repeated her love for Venn diagrams.  ""I love Venn diagrams. I do. I love Venn diagrams. So, the three circles  and you can do more! Nobody says a Venn diagram has to only be three circles, right?"" Harris said Thursday.  KAMALA HARRIS CALLS HOUSE-PASSED BORN-ALIVE ACT EXTREME, CLAIMS IT JEOPARDIZES REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS  She made similar comments in October.  ""Let me just say, I love Venn diagrams. I really love Venn diagrams. You know, the circles, right?"" Harris said.  Back to the Michigan event, the vice president jovially referenced the prospect of electric school buses. ""I'm excited about electric school buses. I LOVE electric school buses. I just love them! For so many reasons. Maybe because I went to school on a school bus. Hey, raise your hand if you went to school on a school bus!"" Harris exclaimed while raising her hand. The comment was almost identical to one she made during a Seattle appearance back in October. ""Who doesn't love a yellow school bus, right? Can you raise your hand if you love a yellow school bus? Many of us went to school on the yellow school bus, right? Its part of our experience growing up,"" Harris said. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., joked, ""Other than failing as Border Czar and talking about Venn diagrams, what does Kamala Harris even do all day?"" ""Bidens day: Gets a Special Counsel Kamala: I'm excited about electric school buses! I love electric school buses! I just love them for so many reasons! Maybe b/c I went to school on a school bus? Raise your hand if you went to school on a school bus!!!'"" Steve Guest, communications adviser for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted. ""Seriously, wtf is her deal with venn diagrams,"" X Strategies senior digital strategist Greg Price wrote. ""Also did the whole school bus forced laughter thing at this event. Playin the hits!"" Townhall.com political editor Guy Benson commented. REPUBLICANS SHOULD CHEER: JOE BIDEN WILL REPORTEDLY RUN AGAIN IN 2024  Others commented on what they considered Harris' bizarre description of the Caribbean islands. ""In the Western hemisphere, that is where the Caribbean is. We are also in the Western Hemisphere. They are our neighbors,"" Harris said. ""Geography czar Kamala Harris,"" Washington Free Beacon investigative reporter Chuck Ross joked. ""Groundbreaking stuff,"" Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' rapid response director Christina Pushaw tweeted. In March of last year, Harris was mocked for a similar oversimplification of the war in Ukraine, as well as ""nonsense"" regarding a climate plan. ""Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine, so basically thats wrong,"" Harris said. Telegraph contributor Nile Gardiner poked fun at Harris saying, ""I think of this moment as a moment that is about great momentum."" ""Kamala Harris talks complete nonsense,"" he wrote.  The comment reminded social media users of a different event, where she stated, ""Thats why were here today. Because we have the ability to see what can be unburdened by what has been and then to make the possible actually happen.""  Harris has frequently been mocked for word salads and awkward public interactions since taking on her position as vice president.",12/01/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-mocked-repeating-several-word-salads-during-climate-crisis-talk-wtf-deal
Greta Thunberg removed by German police from site of mass-climate change protest at coal mine,"German police reportedly removed 20-year-old climate change activist Greta Thunberg from the site of a mass protest over the demolition of an abandoned village for the expansion of a coal mine.  Thunberg, a self-proclaimed Swedish ""autistic climate justice advocate,"" joined thousands of demonstrators who showed up Saturday to protest the clearance of the hamlet of Luetzerath, walking through the nearby village of Keyenberg and past muddy fields in western Germany.  On Sunday, Thunberg again failed with police requests to leave the site, before two officers carried her away, the German newspaper BILD reported, showing a photo of Thunberg smiling with two officers, each wearing a helmet outfitted with a face shield, on each side taking her by the arms.  According to BILD, German police said that 70 officers were injured and nine protesters were taken to the hospital in an ambulance during the weekend demonstrations though no one was seriously injured. Organizers of the protest, however, claimed Saturday several demonstrators were critically hurt.  THUNBERG SWIPES AT ANDREW TATE AMID HUMAN TRAFFICKING CHARGES IN TWITTER SPAT  The operation to evict climate activists who flocked to the site in Luetzerath, west of Cologne, kicked off Wednesday morning and progressed steadily over the following days. Police cleared people out of farm buildings, the few remaining houses and a few dozen makeshift constructions such as tree houses. On Saturday, thousands of people demonstrated nearby against the eviction and the planned expansion of the Garzweiler coal mine. There were standoffs with police as some protesters tried to reach the village, which is now fenced off, and the mine. Environmentalists say bulldozing the village to expand the Garzweiler mine would result in huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. The government and utility company RWE argue the coal is needed to ensure Germanys energy security. Russias invasion of Ukraine last February has heightened concerns for Europe to ensure its energy independence from the Kremlin.  The German regional and national governments, both of which include the environmentalist Green party, reached a deal with RWE last year allowing it to destroy the abandoned village in return for ending coal use by 2030, rather than 2038. The Greens' leaders argue that the deal fulfills many of the environmentalists demands and saved five other villages from demolition and that Luetzerath is the wrong symbol for protests. Activists reject that stance. Police said in a statement Sunday that nearly 300 people have been removed so far from Luetzerath. They added that ""the rescue by RWE Power of the two people in underground structures continues; beyond that, the clearance by police is complete."" They said that 12 people were detained in connection with Saturday's incidents. Demolition of the buildings in Luetzerath is already underway. On Saturday, police said Thunberg briefly sat on an embankment at the edge of the mine and officers carried her a few steps away after didn't comply with calls to move for her own safety, German news agency DPA reported, adding that she then went on her way. Video shows Thunberg linking arms with other protesters as police attempt to push the group of them away from the demolition site.   By Monday, police said the last two protesters who had remained inside a self-dug tunnel for days to prevent heavy equipment from being brought in to bulldoze the hamlet had left the site.

"Davos conference speaker says climate change, malaria connected, as are inflation and TB","Climate change is increasing malaria infections, the executive director of the world's biggest health fund said in Davos on Monday. Huge surges in malaria infections followed recent floods in Pakistan and cyclones in Mozambique in 2021, said Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. ""Whenever you have an extreme weather event it's fairly common to have a surge of malaria,"" he said at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos. ECO GROUP SLAMS DAVOS SUMMIT AS GLOBAL ELITES ARRIVE IN PRIVATE JETS TO TALK CLIMATE POLICY The increase in extreme weather events, and the resulting large pools of standing water that attract mosquitoes, are leaving poorer populations vulnerable. He said climate change was also changing the geography of mosquitoes. The highlands of Africa, in Kenya and Ethiopia, are now succumbing to malaria because of a shift in the low temperatures that once made the area unsustainable for mosquitoes. Sands runs the world's largest global fund, which invests in fighting tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS in some of the poorest nations in the world. The fund, which set a target of raising $18 billion, has so far raised $15.7 billion, the largest amount of money ever raised in global health. Part of the shortfall, he said, was a billion dollar hit from currency fluctuations that affected donations. Looking ahead, climate change is just one of the factors that could hamper efforts to eradicate the diseases, Sands said. 'FIGHT WE MUST': RON DESANTIS FLAMES DAVOS 'JETSETTERS,' 'TECHNOCRATIC ELITES' IN FIERY INAUGURATION SPEECH The war in Ukraine has led to a worsening of AIDS and tuberculosis. In middle income countries such as India, Pakistan and Indonesia, tuberculosis cases amongst the poorest populations are also rising. With fears of a global recession rising, Sands said those countries would come under increased pressure. ""I think the big concern from our perspective is what happens to health budgets in the 120 or so countries we are investing.""

Al Gore says Inflation Reduction Act mainly climate change bill,"Former Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday said the Inflation Reduction Act is primarily a climate change bill during the World Economic Forum (WEF) summit.  Speaking on a panel, Gore, who has made fighting climate change one of his main priorities, listed the passage of the inflation bill as one of the best accomplishments by the United States.  ""In my country, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which is primarily a climate act, $369 billion, which will actually be much larger than that, because the heavy lifting is done by tax credits that are very long-term, some of them actually open-ended, and the early investments that have already been triggered by it give a great deal of reason, many reasons, for believing its going to be much larger than $369 billion,"" Gore said at the Davos, Switzerland forum. ""So Im very encouraged by that."" ELITES IN DAVOS STRATEGIZE ON HOW TO FIGHT RIGHT-WING' GROUPS: HIT BACK The $739 billion package was passed last year to combat soaring costs that have hamstrung many Americans. Included in the legislation is an estimated $369 billion going toward investments in ""Energy Security and Climate Change."" The bill offers tax credits to households to make cost-saving energy efficiency improvements to their homes and other incentives to manufacturers.  The Environmental Defense Fund called it the ""biggest package of climate investments in U.S. history.""    Despite the intent to fight inflation, multiple analyses concluded the package doesn't. The Congressional Budget Office said the bill will have ""a negligible effect"" and its impact in 2023 would range between reducing inflation by 0.1% and increasing it by 0.1%.",18/01/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/al-gore-inflation-reduction-act-climate-change-bill
"Coffee?? ??ontribution to climate change' is just the ??ip of the iceberg,??study says","Canadian researchers analyzed coffee's ""contribution to climate change"" in a piece published in early January and suggested people moderate their consumption of the popular drink as a part of the solution. Researchers Luciano Rodrigues Viana, Charles Marty, Jean-Francois Boucher and Pierre-Luc Dessureault wrote in an analysis published in The Conversation that pollution from preparing coffee was ""just the tip of the iceberg."" ""Limiting your contribution to climate change requires an adapted diet, and coffee is no exception. Choosing a mode of coffee preparation that emits less GHGs (greenhouse gases) and moderating your consumption are part of the solution,"" the researchers at the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi wrote.  The study also found that using coffee pods to brew coffee contributed less to the carbon footprint than brewing coffee with a traditional filter.  BEN AFFLECK CAUSES SOCIAL MEDIA FRENZY SERVING DUNKIN' DONUTS TO CUSTOMERS, FIREFIGHERS: LIVING THE DREAM  ""Our analysis clearly showed that traditional filter coffee has the highest carbon footprint, mainly because a greater quantity of coffee powder is used to produce the amount of coffee. This process also consumes more electricity to heat the water and keep it warm,"" the researchers wrote.  The researchers compared brewing with coffee pods, brewing coffee the traditional way in a coffee maker, brewing coffee with a French press and using instant coffee. ""Our analysis clearly showed that traditional filter coffee has the highest carbon footprint, mainly because a greater quantity of coffee powder is used to produce the amount of coffee. This process also consumes more electricity to heat the water and keep it warm,"" the researchers wrote.  They found that instant coffee was the most environmentally sound.  FILTERED COFFEE IS MORE HEART HEALTHY THAN OTHER METHODS, STUDY CLAIMS Coffee production contributed more to contributed to total emission than coffee preparation, according to the analysis.  ""This mechanization, irrigation and use of nitrous oxide-emitting fertilizers  the production of which requires large quantities of natural gas  greatly contribute to coffees carbon footprint,"" the researchers said.  The researchers also added that the convenience of coffee pods might lead people to double their coffee consumption and in turn make the environmental advantage ""redundant.""  Studies released last year found that drinking one to two cups of coffee a day may benefit heart health.  The American College of Cardiology found in a study released in March 2022 that coffee was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and dangerous heart rhythms.",18/01/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/media/coffees-contribution-climate-change-just-tip-iceberg-study-says
Global elites took 150+ private jets to fight climate change in Davos,"Business executives, celebrities, billionaires and government officials traveled to the World Economic Forum (WEF) summit last week largely using private jets, according to a Fox News Digital analysis of flight data. During the conference, which began on Jan. 16 and concluded Friday, at least 150 private jets flew into three of the closest airstrips near WEF's headquarters in Davos, Switzerland, according to data obtained from flight tracking software Flightradar24. The data suggests that conference attendees spewed hundreds of thousands of pounds and thousands of metric tons of carbon as a result of their private jet usage. ""Europe is experiencing the warmest January days ever recorded and communities around the world are grappling with extreme weather events supercharged by the climate crisis,"" Klara Maria Schenk, a campaigner for environmental group Greenpeace International, said in a statement ahead of the conference.  ""Meanwhile, the rich and powerful flock to Davos in ultra-polluting, socially inequitable private jets to discuss climate and inequality behind closed doors,"" she continued. ECO GROUP SLAMS DAVOS SUMMIT AS GLOBAL ELITES ARRIVE IN PRIVATE JETS TO TALK CLIMATE POLICY Private jet travel is by far the most carbon-intensive mode of transportation. They are about 10 times more carbon-intensive than commercial planes and 50 times more carbon-intensive than trains, according to a 2021 report from the group Transport &amp; Environment. The flight data broadly showed private jets traveling to the region from various cities around Europe and others from the U.S. and Asia.  For example, on Jan. 15, a Gulfstream G650 jet traveled from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Friedrichshafen Airport, a small airstrip two hours north of Davos. The nine-hour flight burned an estimated 44 metric tons of carbon, according to an emissions calculator created by the firm Paramount Business Jets.  JOHN KERRY'S FAMILY PRIVATE JET EMITTED OVER 300 METRIC TONS OF CARBON SINCE BIDEN TOOK OFFICE Another long-distance private jet flight  from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Friedrichshafen Airport on a Bombardier Global 6000 jet on Jan. 16  burned roughly 42 metric tons of carbon. And a four-hour flight on Friday from Baku, Azerbaijan, to St. GallenAltenrhein Airport on the same model aircraft emitted about 23 metric tons of carbon. By comparison, the average person worldwide has an estimated annual carbon footprint of four tons.  In addition, dozens of the private jet trips tracked by Fox News Digital were short-distance flights from bordering countries.  In one example, on Tuesday, an Embraer Phenom 300 jet traveled just 31 minutes from Milan, Italy, to St. GallenAltenrhein Airport. On Thursday, a Cessna 680A Citation Latitude flew 53 minutes from Prague, Czech Republic, to the same airport. Other short-distance flights came from Buochs, Switzerland; Speyer, Germany; Frankfurt, Germany, Turin, Italy; Salzburg, Austria; Nice, France; Lyon, France and Cannes, France. Meanwhile, the WEF conference's agenda focused largely on environmental issues like climate change and achieving net-zero ambitions. The conference's program highlighted the top priority as ""addressing the current energy and food crises in the context of a new system for energy, climate and nature."" PETE BUTTIGIEG TOOK GOVERNMENT JET TO NYC FOR RADIO INTERVIEW, ACLU MEETING BEFORE FLYING BACK HOURS LATER And several high-profile climate activists and officials, such as Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and former Vice President Al Gore, attended the summit, imploring fellow attendees to double down on climate commitments.  ""When you start to think about it, it's pretty extraordinary that we  select group of human beings because of whatever touched us at some point in our lives  are able to sit in a room and come together and actually talk about saving the planet,"" Kerry remarked on Tuesday. ""I mean, it's so almost extraterrestrial to think about saving the planet."" While the three airports  St. GallenAltenrhein Airport, Samedan Airport and Friedrichshafen Airport  analyzed by Fox News Digital are popular airstrips for individuals traveling to WEF summits, previous studies of private jet travel to Davos have tracked flights into four additional airports including Geneva Airport and Zurich Airport, two major international travel hubs.   Such studies have determined that between 1,000-1,500 private jets traveled to all the surrounding airports near Davos during past WEF summits. In 2019, WEF responded to criticism, acknowledging that attendees had taken about 500 jets to the summit that year, but said attendees were ""taking the environmental impact of their travel more seriously."" ""We have been offering incentives to participants to use public transport for some years,"" WEF said in a statement in January 2019. ""We also ask that they share planes if they have to use them; something that has been gaining popularity in recent years.""

""Well, you know, you can take anything - sexism, racism, misogyny, homophobia, whatever, the war,"" the actress said. ""And if you really get into it, and study it and learn about it and the history of it and everything's connected. There'd be no climate crisis if it wasn't for racism.""

"Miami should begin 'preparing for evacuation' due to climate change, Berkeley professor argues","Daniel Aldana Cohen and Samantha Schuyler provided arguments regarding the question ""Should We Start Preparing for the Evacuation of Miami?"" in a piece for The Nation on Friday. Cohen, a UC Berkeley sociology professor, offered the main argument in support of evacuating the major Florida city to both help Floridians and ""force municipalities across the United States to get serious about hosting climate migrants in egalitarian ways."" ""Its urgent for governments and social movements to start planning for millions of people to land in new places. Prepping Miamis evacuation is a perfect starting point. Its residents are a multiracial, multinational, and multigenerational assemblage that spans the class spectrum. Tragically, many of them are already climate migrantslike Puerto Ricans displaced by recent hurricanes,"" Cohen said. He continued, ""If cities around the country were forced to plan how theyd integrate arriving Miamians into communities flush with public green investment, theyd get a head start on planning for climate migration generally. This would also trigger conversations about zoning for density, enshrining tenant rights, upgrading infrastructure, taxing the rich, building green banks, and battling racism and police violence."" CNN CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT TOUTS STUDY PREDICTING GLOBAL DOOM AND DEATH SENTENCE FOR ISLAND NATIONS  Cohen further criticized the U.S. for taking part in what he referred to as ""racial violence"" for failing to properly relocate citizens. ""And yet, right now, the U.S. doesnt have a justor even functionalpolicy for immigrants and refugees. Its still struggling to support Indigenous communities facing displacement from environmental calamities caused by colonial settlers. And the US has handled domestic movements for freedom terribly. In the last century, the emancipatory promise of the Great Migration was savagely curtailed by segregation and mass incarceration. Leading sociologists and scholars of environmental injustice called this racial violence a form of apartheid. Today, a surge in climate displacement threatens to deepen this eco-apartheid,"" Cohen wrote. Although Schuyler, The Nations research director, argued against evacuating Miami, she instead argued to further adapt coastal cities to prepare for climate disasters. MIAMI MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: AMERICA NEEDS GENERATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND A POSITIVE MESSAGE  ""Shortsighted, surface-level adaptations arent going to save metropolises like Miami; we need to reimagine coastal living. The United Nations estimates that over 1 billion people live in low-lying cities vulnerable to coast-specific climate hazards,"" Schuyler wrote. ""Miami, therefore, has a lot of work to do. So far, the metro areas attempts at resiliency have been green-lighted and financed in such a halting, disjointed, and uncoordinated way that they have resulted in a faulty patchwork of projects."" She also conceded, ""At some point, if South Florida doesnt change its approach to navigating climate change, evacuation will be necessary. But by withdrawing from Miami too soon, we will lose a vibrant city that could have become a training ground for learning how to adapt to the planets future. Its not just South Florida that is facing climate catastrophe; its Los Angeles, New York City, Mumbai, and many other places. Tremendous human effort created Miami, and if we act soon, that kind of effort can save it tooand show the world how its done.""  As recently as October, mainstream media touted climate change as a threat to Florida, particularly after the state faced Hurricane Ian.

""Because of our climate investments, our kids will breathe cleaner air, drink safer water, and get to school powered by clean energy,"" Biden tweeted Tuesday morning. The president added, ""Thats the future were building,"" tapping EPA Administrator Michael Regan, ""lets finish the job.""  Twitter users, however, accused the timing of the tweet of being ""tone deaf,"" as concerned residents who live miles away from the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment are telling local news outlets that theyre still smelling lingering odors in the atmosphere. Some reported developing worsening coughs. Others expressed fears of drinking or bathing in the water coming from their faucets despite water utilities across state lines in West Virginia taking precautions and local officials assuring its safe.   One resident of North Lima, more than 10 miles from East Palestine, told WKBN-TV that her five hens and rooster mysteriously slowed before ultimately dropping dead this week, spurring fears among other animal owners that livestock might be exposed to chemicals through the air, water and soil.  OHIO TRAIN DERAILMENT PROMPTS WATER UTILITY ACROSS STATE LINES TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS AS HEALTH CONCERNS MOUNT  ""Not in Ohio,"" one Twitter wrote, replying to Biden's tweet.  ""Does Ohio not exist to this guy? Extremely poor timing to talk about the climate,"" another user added.  ""The audacity of this statement considering whats going on in Ohio and its [sic] surrounding states. Yet, once again, Biden remains mum on the subject,"" a third wrote.  In a Feb. 10 letter, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notified Norfolk Southern Railway Company of the threat of additional pollutants or contaminants released into the environment from the East Palestine derailment site. In addition to vinyl chloride, the chemical widely reported after the controlled release, the letter said multiple rail cars and tankers were observed derailed, breached, and/or on fire, that included but were not limited to ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylhexyl acrylate, isobutylene, and butyl acrylate.  The EPA admitted, ""vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate, and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether are known to have been and continue to be released to the air, surface soils, and surface waters."" Also of concern are phosgene gas and hydrogen chloride gas, which the EPA detected in air monitoring.  One outraged Twitter user noted that phosgene gas was used as a ""choking agent"" in World War I, condemning Biden as a ""blight on humanity.""   ""This idiot nuked Ohio. And he wants to talk about clean air?"" another user wrote.  At approximately 8:55 p.m. on Feb. 3, 38 rail cars of a Norfolk Southern trains 150 cars derailed in East Palestine, an Ohio village of some 4,700 residents about 50 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. A fire ensued, damaging an additional 12 rail cars. The EPA said there were 20 total hazardous material cars in the train, 11 of which derailed.  Residents on both sides of the Ohio-Pennsylvania border were ordered to evacuate amid fears of a possible explosion as a fire sent smoke billowing into the air.  Three days later, authorities held a controlled release of the chemicals.  Five rail car tankers of vinyl chloride were intentionally breached, and the chemical was diverted to an excavated trench and then burned off. The EPA said areas of contaminated soil and free liquids were observed and potentially covered and/or filled during reconstruction of the rail line, including portions of the burn pit.  On Feb. 8, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told residents they could return home and air quality samples in the area were showing readings below safety screening levels for contaminants. As of Monday, the EPA said 291 homes have been screened and no detections of vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride were identified to date. There were 181 homes that remain to be screened.  On Tuesday, Bidens official account shared a Jan. 10 video from Regan during a visit to Bucyrus, Kansas, following the presidents State of the Union address. While there, Regan says he took a ride on the first-ever electric school bus in Kansas thanks to the EPAs Clean School Buses Program.  He also shows drones in the skies at Guetterman Brothers Family Farms, saying he was ""looking how advanced technology will usher in clean tech and combat the climate crisis.""

"Climate crisis could have been avoided if colonists adopted indigenous lifestyle, says top Biden official","Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said Tuesday that the harmful effects of climate change being felt today around the world would not be as bad if early colonizers had adopted the environmental practices of the indigenous tribes they eventually supplanted.  ""Many of the challenges we face today  a warming planet, the loss of habitat and wildlife, dying coral reefs  these could have been lessened or completely avoided  if early colonists had valued the stewardship practices and environmental wisdom that tribes have cultivated over thousands of years,"" Haaland said in her prepared remarks in Perth, Australia. Haaland appeared to be talking about both the situation in America and Australia, as well as other countries that were colonized over the last several hundred years. Haaland said her mothers side of the family can be traced back 35 generations to an indigenous tribe that ""has called the Southwest United States home for millennia."" She said that tribe lived in that region of the world in a sustainable way, and used its knowledge to ""escape drought, to feed their families, to care for the earth, and to coexist with the land, water, and wildlife that sustained them."" NATIVE AMERICAN ATTORNEY NAMED AS TOP LEGAL ADVISOR TO INTERIOR SECRETARY DEB HAALAND She said that in Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people ""have cared for the land that sustains communities across this country."" Haaland said that solving the climate crisis requires an effort to draw on the hundreds of years of experience that indigenous populations have living on the land in a sustainable way. She said the Biden administration is seeking help from Native American tribes to fulfill its pledge to cut carbon emissions by 2030. ""Through indigenous-led conservation and co-stewardship initiatives, the United States is creating opportunities for the original stewards of our countrys lands and waters to participate in how they are managed,"" she said. DEB HAALAND: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BIDEN'S SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR NOMINEE ""What is critical here is that we are putting words into action,"" she added. ""And the exciting part is that much of what we are doing can be replicated for a more equitable and climate-resilient future worldwide."" In 2022, for example, the Biden administration gave 465 acres of land in Virginias coast to the Rappahannock Tribe, who will help manage that land. ""Through the agreement, the Tribe will draw on its Indigenous knowledge and practices to better manage the areas habitat, which is a globally significant nesting location for resident and migratory bald eagles,"" she said. ""The Tribe also plans to expand its river education program, which conveys traditional river knowledge and practices to young people and their surrounding communities."" BIDEN CHOOSES DEB HAALAND FOR INTERIOR, AOC PRAISES THE PROGRESSIVE MOVE  Haaland said 20 of these agreements have been struck under the Biden administration, and 60 more are being developed. She reported that similar efforts are being undertaken in Australia, where indigenous knowledge is being used to ""protect iconic and threatened ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef."" Haaland said that indigenous people who are ""of the land"" can better preserve resources for future generations.  ""Our solutions should be informed by thousands of years of observation, interaction and intimate understanding of our planets natural systems,"" Haaland said. ""By centering Indigenous-led conservation, we can leverage the diversified and locally informed knowledge of the communities who have always stewarded the land and waters we all depend on.""",14/02/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-crisis-avoided-colonists-adopted-indigenous-lifestyle-top-biden-official
GOP Sen. Josh Hawley interrupted by climate protester during speech: 'China is not our enemy',"A climate protester interrupted Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley's speech on foreign policy Thursday by walking on stage and shouting ""China's not our enemy, the climate crisis is."" A woman with a handcrafted poster containing the words ""people [and] planet, not war [and] aggression"" written on it stood up and shouted as Hawley gave remarks to the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C. ""I think you're forgetting that we have the largest military in the world. We spend over $1 trillion every year in this state,"" the unidentified woman claimed as she walked onstage alongside Hawley. ""Your state of Missouri... over half the people are in poverty."" YOUTH TRANS CLINICS PROVIDING 'GENDER-AFFIRMING' CARE TARGETED BY NEW HAWLEY BILL A security guard for the event grabbed the woman and began to pull her away from the stage as she yelled, ""China's not our enemy, the climate crisis is."" ""We need to be more serious about the climate crisis,"" she added as she was removed from the event. ""We are continuing to have more aggression with China and we're spending more on our military than 100 countries combined. The climate crisis is our common threat."" After the woman was removed from the room, Hawley went back to his remarks, saying, ""It's interesting this administration wants to use the climate crisis as a justification for its agenda in Ukraine and elsewhere."" ""Maybe they ought to visit with that gal,"" he added. Following the event, Hawley took to Twitter, where he referred to the protester as President Biden's ""next energy secretary"" and suggested that her interruption of his remarks was ""so fun."" ""Just saying out loud what Biden actually believes,"" Hawley added of the protester in a separate tweet.  Responding to the outburst from the climate protester, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said the notion that China is not a greater threat than climate change is ""idiotic."" ""Even if China wasnt the worlds worst polluter  which it is  the idea that climate change is a greater threat to the United States than the Chinese Communist Party is idiotic,"" Roberts told Fox News Digital. ""Whats even more foolish  this administrations willingness to ignore very real threats from China because they want a purely political win on climate change.""",16/02/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-sen-josh-hawley-interrupted-climate-protester-during-speech-china-not-our-enemy
Senate Dems focus on climate change ??larmism??in first budget hearing but no sign of budget plan,"Democrats this week used the first Senate Budget Committee hearing of the new Congress to talk about climate change, a decision that drew complaints from Republicans who said the committee should focus on producing a budget after it failed to get that job done last year. The new chairman of the committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., has issued dire warnings about a climate catastrophe for several years and has delivered dozens of climate speeches on the Senate floor alongside a poster of planet Earth that says, ""Time to Wake Up."" On Wednesday, Whitehouse convened a Budget Committee hearing on the ""Climate-Related Economic Risks and Their Costs to the Federal Budget."" Whitehouse argued that big chunks of the $31.4 trillion national debt were added on because of crisis events like the mortgage crisis and COVID and that the impending climate crisis is another crucial challenge that will likely lead to more debt. ""The reason were having this hearing and the reason that were going to continue to have hearings on this subject is that $10 trillion of our federal debt can be ascribed to exogenous shocks to our economy with which we had to cope,"" Whitehouse said. ""It wasnt cheap, but we had to do it. The biggest exogenous shock on the horizon out there is climate upheaval."" BIDEN TORCHED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE TWEET VOWING CLEANER AIR, SAFER WATER AMID OHIO TRAIN DERAILMENT But Republicans accused Whitehouse of pursuing a climate agenda in a committee thats charged with putting together a budget plan, a task that Senate Democrats failed to achieve last year. The top Republican on the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Democrats were ignoring the purpose of the committee to make it about one of their favorite pet projects. ""Instead of focusing on the growing national debt, out-of-control deficits or the consequences of our spending addiction, Democrats selected climate change for the topic of their first hearing,"" Grassley said Wednesday. While Grassley said the changing environment is a legitimate issue to consider when looking at the federal budget, he added that the Senate has other committees, like Environment and Public Works and Energy and Natural Resources, to deal with climate issues. ""Only the budget committee is tasked with developing a budget,"" he said. ""That ought to be our focus."" CONSERVATIVES SHARPEN THEIR SPEARS FOR HISTORIC DEBT CEILING FIGHT Other Republicans agreed and accused Democrats of trying to inject ""climate hysteria"" into every issue. ""The United States is more than $31 trillion in debt,"" said committee member Roger Marshall, R-Kan. ""This is the true threat to national security that the Budget Committee should prioritize, not the lefts climate hysteria."" ""Lets not fool ourselves, and most importantly, lets not fool those we represent, the American people,"" added Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, during the hearing. ""Our ballooning deficits and burgeoning debt have been driven by and will continue to be driven by runaway profligate spending by the federal government, not because of any effects of climate change. That is a different thing."" He said Democrats are using ""climate alarmism"" in order to justify the federal takeover of the U.S. economy. ""Its my hope that this committee will spend more of its time and effort this Congress deliberating ways to reduce our budget deficits so that we can stabilize our debt while putting our budget on a pathway to balance,"" he said. GRASSLEY RIPS SENATE'S SLEEPY WORK SCHEDULE UNDER DEM LEADERSHIP: THINGS NEED TO CHANGE Republicans broadly took the hearing as a sign that Democrats are not serious about reining in federal spending, despite broad consensus among many economists that rampant spending during the COVID pandemic juiced consumer demand and led to inflation levels that hadnt been seen in decades. Grassley noted that under Democratic leadership in the last Congress, the Budget Committee failed to approve a budget and the Senate didnt consider any of the 12 annual spending bills that are supposed to be the mechanism by which Congress manages the federal government. Instead, Congress passed a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill at the end of last year that bumped up federal spending even more, he said. Grassley said both parties are to blame for the massive national debt but said Democrats played a larger role in ramping up spending during COVID. ""For decades, Congress turned a blind eye as our nation walked toward a fiscal cliff. But Democrats turned that walk into a sprint,"" he said. ""In March 2021, Democrats took advantage of an emergency situation to pass a $2 trillion partisan spending bill, even as our economy showed strong signs of recovery. Then as inflation soared to a 40-year high, they doubled down, spending trillions more on their liberal wish lists,"" Grassley added.  In the House, the Republican majority is widely expected to pass a budget resolution this year and send it along to the Senate, but its not clear if the Senate will try to pass its own. Its also not clear if the House Budget Committee will wait for President Joe Bidens budget proposal  which is already late and not expected to arrive until March  or forge ahead on its own.",16/02/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-dems-focus-climate-change-alarmism-first-budget-hearing-but-sign-budget-plan
Rep. Barbara Lee launches Senate campaign promising to 'take on climate crisis' and stop 'MAGA extremists',"California Democrat Rep. Barbara Lee on Tuesday announced she's running for  the U.S. Senate, and joined a small group of Democrats seeking to replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein. ""To do nothing has never been an option for me,"" Lee said in the video announcing her campaign that highlighted her days as a student facing segregation on a cheerleading team, and her opposition to military authorization for the Iraq war while in Congress. ""When my high school said cheerleaders couldnt be Black, I took them on. I worked with the NAACP, and earned my spot as the schools first black cheerleader,"" Lee said in the video. ""When there werent protections for survivors of domestic violence, I wrote Californias first Violence Against Women Act. When it was legal to discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, I wrote the Hate Crimes Reduction Act."" REP. BARBARA LEE FILES TO ENTER RACE FOR FEINSTEINS SEAT ""For those who say my time is past, well, when does making change go out of style?"" Lee said in her campaign launch video. Lee joins California Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Katie Porter in the race for the open Senate seat that Feinstein announced she will vacate at the end of her current term. Schiff and Porter have both attempted to position themselves as the more progressive candidate in the race. Schiff has the backing of powerful House Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, while Porter has the backing of some progressive groups and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. CALIFORNIA SENATE CANDIDATE BARBARA LEE ONCE PRAISED FIDEL CASTRO AS 'A SMART MAN' Lee cited reducing poverty and easing economic burdens of the middle class as top priorities in her campaign video. ""We have to take on the climate crisis, and we have to stop these MAGA extremists who think they can control peoples' bodies and dismantle our democracy. And even though there are no African American women in the United States Senate, that won't stop us either,"" she said. ""When you stand on the side of justice, you dont quit if they dont give you a seat at the table. You bring a folding chair for everyone, and they are here to stay.""  Feinstein, who has represented California in the U.S. Senate since 1992, announced Feb. 14 that she would not seek re-election in 2024, ending months of speculation at what the oldest serving senator would do. Her potential successors did not wait for an announcement  Porter launched her campaign in January and Schiff followed with his own announcement weeks later. ""I'd like to congratulate Senator Feinstein on her historic, trailblazing career and echo the gratitude of her constituents in our beautiful state for her service,"" Lee said Thursday.",21/02/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-barbara-lee-launches-senate-campaign-promising-climate-crisis-stop-maga-extremists
"WWII-style 'rationing' of food, fuel needed to combat climate change, academics claim in new paper","Governments should consider imposing World War II-style policies of rationing on goods such as food, fuel and clothing in order to fight climate change, according to a newly published academic paper. Researchers at the University of Leeds, a top British institution, wrote in the journal Ethics, Policy &amp; Environment that rationing has been wrongfully ""neglected"" as a policy option for mitigating climate change, arguing such an approach would be more effective than the ""slow and inequitable"" results from tax hikes to promote a green agenda. ""We argue that rationing could help states reduce emissions rapidly and fairly,"" the academic paper states. ""Our arguments in this paper draw on economic analysis and historical research into rationing in the UK during (and after) the two world wars, highlighting success stories and correcting misconceptions."" The authors added that the ""rejection of markets, and a commitment to fair shares, is a key part of the value of rationing, and precisely what made rationing attractive to the public in the 1940s."" HOW A FIRST-GENERATION RANCHER USES INSTAGRAM TO DISPEL 'PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS' ABOUT BEEF PRODUCTION Specifically, governments could ration various goods, such as flights, petrol, household energy, and even meat or clothing, according to the paper, which also suggests limiting ""the number of long-haul flights an individual could make in a year"" or ""the amount of petrol one can buy in a month."" Another way to roll out the rationing scheme could be ""carbon cards"" to track one's ""carbon allowance."" Such an idea is not new. Last year, the president of Alibaba Group, a major Chinese tech company, boasted at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting about the development of an ""individual carbon footprint tracker"" that will be able to track where people travel, how they travel, and what they eat. The academics pointed to World War II as a model for rationing supplies to the public, claiming that while a rationing system is perceived as unattractive, many who experienced it did not have a negative experience. REPUBLICANS UNVEIL EFFORT TO REMOVE BIDEN ADMIN'S BARRIERS BLOCKING OIL AND GAS DRILLING ""It is important to emphasize the difference between rationing itself and the scarcity that rationing was a response to,"" the paper states. ""Of course, people did welcome the end of rationing, but they were really celebrating the end of scarcity, and celebrating the fact that rationing was no longer necessary."" A problem with rationing energy, the researchers note, is people might not be as willing to accept it as they would if resources were scarce, because they know there's an ""abundance of resources available."" They suggest therefore regulating fossil fuels through limitations on activities such as oil exploration, long-haul flights, and intensive farming to create a scarcity in products that harm the planet. Then rationing could be introduced gradually to manage the subsequent scarcity. Critics quickly decried the paper's suggestions as extreme and unpalatable. ""Academics propose the rationing to combat climate change!"" tweeted Nigel Farage, a British broadcaster and former politician. ""Flights, meat, petrol and even clothing should have a non-transferable token, tracked by a 'carbon card' instead of bank card. Worst part is these crackpot ideas will soon be mainstream."" The researchers did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. However, the paper's two lead authors provided statements to British press outlets. ""There is a limit to how much we can emit if we are to reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change. In this sense, the scarcity is very real,"" said Rob Lawlor. Fellow lead author Nathan Wood said, ""The concept of rationing could help, not only in the mitigation of climate change, but also in reference to a variety of other social and political issues  such as the current energy crisis.""  Some supermarkets in Britain have already begun rationing fruits and vegetables amid soaring energy costs, which have devastated some farmers.",23/02/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wwii-style-rationing-food-fuel-combat-climate-change-academics-claim-new-paper
New warning about the 'dire' impact of the 'climate crisis' on nursing homes,"The USA Today used a Senate committee report on nursing home deaths from the February 2021 ice storm to warn about the ""dire"" impact of the ""climate crisis."" The report from the Senate Finance Committee and Senate Special Committee on Aging on ""The impact of the 2021 Texas Blackout on Long-Term Care Residents and the Need to Improve Emergency Preparedness"" did not make climate change a major focus, but reporter Ken Alltucker's article did. The USA Today piece was titled ""US nursing homes aren't safe amid climate crisis, report finds. And it's getting worse."" and the subheading said, ""A Senate report examines the dire situation and what the worsening climate crisis means for the nation's vulnerable adults."" Alltucker wrote that the report ""highlights the risks confronting medically vulnerable adults and disabled residents during climate change-driven extreme heat or cold, floods, tornadoes or wildfires,"" while admitting that wasn't the focus. MSNBC, CNN GIVE STRAIGHT NEWS ON CALIFORNIA GRID ISSUES AFTER PANNING TEXAS OVER WINTER BLACKOUT The results, Alltucker wrote, should lead to ""calls for greater urgency amid climate crisis."" ""Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden said emergency preparedness is pivotal because homes that care for vulnerable residents will face greater challenges as the climate crisis leads to an increase in severe weather events,"" he wrote. Wyden was quoted, ""This report is a case study of just one in an increasing number of circumstances where elderly or infirm Americans are subjected to difficult conditions due to severe weather. Whether its a winter storm, hurricane or wildfire, more must be done to ensure long-term care facilities are adequately prepared to handle these events and care for their residents."" CHATGPT CONFESSION: GLOBAL WARMING? NOT MUCH SINCE 2016  Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., claimed in the article that the latest reports should be ""warning signs"" for dealing with climate crises in the future. ""As we experience more frequent and catastrophic climate disasters, long-term care facilities must be better prepared to protect residents living there,"" Casey told USA Today. Alltucker also quoted David Dosa, a Brown University professor, who warned about the impact of climate change disasters on nursing home patients. ED BEGLEY JR. SAYS ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM HURT HIS ACTING CAREER: I GAVE PEOPLE THE CREEPS  ""[Dosa] cited the example of 19 deaths at Lafon nursing home in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Emergency management crews were in the parking lot of the facility as people died,"" Alltucker wrote. ""People died in that facility literally right under their nose,"" Dosa was quoted as saying. ""These are just very vulnerable people who, unfortunately, get subjected to this kind of climate change event and don't do well."" Mainstream media outlets and Democratic figures have frequently blamed climate change for several issues, some of which did not involve weather disasters. In Oct. 2022, the Washington Post weather reporter Amudalat Ajasa suggested that extreme temperatures caused by climate change can cause people to engage in ""hate speech and hostile behavior."" In Aug. 2022, CBS published a study claiming that ""climate change, specifically warmer temperatures is making our children more inactive and more obese.""  ""Climate change"" was also frequently blamed for Hurricane Ian hitting Florida in October, however, experts pushed back, arguing that individual storms cannot be linked to climate change.",27/02/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-warning-dire-impact-climate-crisis-nursing-homes
John Kerry is the Neville Chamberlain of climate change,"Our country recently received a sobering wakeup call with Chinas spy balloon hovering over our skies. The blatant violation of American sovereignty wasnt just an off-hand stunt, it was emblematic of Communist Chinas view that they can get away with any aggressive actions against America with little consequences. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cares first and foremost about displacing the United States from its perch among the worlds powers, and this is particularly true when it comes to powering the world. As the Biden administration continues to shift American energy policy away from fossil fuels and toward green alternatives, its playing right into Chinas hands. More specifically, Chinas clean energy supremacy should be viewed as a direct threat to the United States. China controls large parts of the supply chains for critical minerals (e.g., copper, nickel, and lithium) and rare earth elements. These materials are absolutely crucial to clean energy technologies, like electric vehicles and solar panels, as well as a range of essential products from smartphones to fighter jets. CHINA, US HEADING FOR CONFLICT AND CONFRONTATION,' FOREIGN MINISTER WARNS In the modern-day gold rush for these irreplaceable building blocks, China is dominating  with the help of Uyghur forced labor and its predatory Belt and Road Initiative that gives high interest loans to developing countries. While CCP does not have a monopoly over upstream production of critical minerals, they have a stranglehold on the midstream and downstream supply chains. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China refines between 60 and 70 percent of cobalt and lithium and a stunning 90 percent of rare earth elements Some on the left, however, say that we must appease China so that they will help us fight climate change. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry has said that the CCPs human rights horrors are ""not my lane.""  Just last month, at a Heritage Foundation event about China and Ukraine, a protester took to the stage with a message consistent with Kerrys actions: ""Chinas not our enemy, the climate crisis is."" This mistaken approach toward China is as dangerous as it is delusional. First, from espionage and human rights abuses to supply chain monopolies and intellectual property thefts, the CCP is clearly a massive threat to U.S. sovereignty. Second, China emits more than the whole developed world and is building an astonishing number of coal plants. Many in the Biden administration, notably John Kerry, are willing to sacrifice national security and human rights concerns in the name of climate policy  but this futile attempt to appease Chairman Xi wont get the worlds worst emitter to decarbonize any faster than is in its own interests. John Kerry is the Neville Chamberlain of climate change. China interprets this posture as weakness and is exploiting it. Thankfully, there are ways to resist dependence on the CCP for critical minerals and rare earth elements  and do more for the environment than Democrats approach. Instead of denying domestic mining, such as mining in Minnesota for copper and nickel, we need more of it. ""Made in America"" has a national security component, and U.S. mines are much better for our economy, security, and the climate than Chinese mines. Working with our North American allies will also strengthen our supply chains. Additionally, we must support innovative developments with two power sources that Democrats have often opposed, reliable and carbon-free nuclear and carbon capture for fossil fuels. We should also diversify our energy mix so we are not overly reliant on one power source or one foreign power  then we can protect this country while remaining the worlds leader in reducing emissions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Countering Chinas control of clean energy supply chains wont be easy, and, at least initially, it will be more expensive. But dependence on the CCP is the highest price of all. So, while we are focusing on the skies above us right now, lets not forget the natural resources under our feet  resources we must cultivate to prevent reliance on the CCP for keeping our lights on and homes heated. By mining more, and ensuring reliable access to diverse power sources, we can prevent China from surpassing the United States. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

Oregon eyes mandate for climate change lessons in schools,"Oregon lawmakers are aiming to make the state the second in the nation to mandate climate change lessons for K-12 public school students, further fueling U.S. culture wars in education. Dozens of Oregon high schoolers submitted support of the bill, saying they care about climate change deeply. Some teachers and parents say teaching climate change could help the next generation better confront it, but others want schools to focus on reading, writing and math after test scores plummeted post-pandemic. Schools across the U.S. have found themselves at the center of a politically charged battle over curriculum and how matters such as gender, sex education and race should be taught  or whether they should be taught at all. TO AVOID TODAY'S WOKENESS, PARENTS ARE ENROLLING THEIR KIDS IN CATHOLIC SCHOOL One of the bills chief sponsors, Democratic Sen. James Manning, said even elementary students have told him climate change is important to them. ""Were talking about third and fourth graders having a vision to understand how this world is changing rapidly,"" he said at a Thursday state Capitol hearing in Salem. Connecticut has the only U.S. state law requiring climate change instruction, and its possibly the first time such a bill has been introduced in Oregon, according to legislative researchers. Lawmakers in California and New York are considering similar bills. Mannings bill requires every Oregon school district to develop climate change curriculum within three years, addressing ecological, societal, cultural, political and mental health aspects of climate change. NEW JERSEY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HIT SNOOZE AS BOARD OF EDUCATION APPROVES LATER START TIME Its unclear how Oregon would enforce the law. Manning told The Associated Press that he is going to scrap an unpopular proposal for financial penalties against districts that dont comply, but didnt say whether another plan was coming. For now, the bill doesnt say how many hours of instruction are needed for the states education department to approve a districts curriculum. Most states have learning standards  largely set by state education boards  that include climate change, although their extent varies by state. Twenty states and Washington, D.C., have specifically adopted what are known as the Next Generation Science Standards, which call for middle schoolers to learn about climate science and high schoolers to receive lessons on how human activity affects the climate. New Jerseys education standards are believed to be the most wide-ranging. For the first time this school year, climate change is not just part of science instruction, but all subjects, like art, English and even PE. Several teens testified at the state Capitol in favor of the bill. No students have submitted opposition testimony. ""In 100 years are we going to have to teach our children what trees are because there arent any left? Its a thought that horrifies me,"" said high school sophomore Gabriel Burke. ""My generation needs to learn about climate change from a young age for our survival."" TOP REPUBLICAN RAISES ALARM ON BIDEN ENERGY SECRETARY'S WORK WITH CHINA-CONNECTED GROUP PUSHING GAS STOVE BAN Some teachers testified in support of the bill. But others say theyre already struggling to address pandemic learning losses. Adding climate change on top of reading, writing, math, science and social studies is ""a heavy lift that will end up coming down on the backs of teachers,"" said Kyler Pace, a grade school teacher in Sherwood, Oregon. Recent surveys conducted by Columbia Universitys Teachers College and the Yale Program on Climate Communication suggest that a majority of Americans think that climate change and global warming should be taught in school. But climate change is still seen by some as a politically divisive issue, and Pace said that mandating its instruction could inject more tension into schools. Nicole De Graff, a self-described parents rights advocate and former GOP legislative candidate, testified that her children, ages 9, 15, and 16, are ""done being overwhelmed with things that are fear-based, like COVID."" In Pennington, New Jersey, wellness teacher Suzanne Horsley aims for age-appropriate lessons on what can be a daunting topic. In her K-2 physical education classes at Toll Gate Grammar School, she plays a game with pretend trees, using bean bags representing carbon to show students that fewer trees leads to higher levels of atmospheric carbon. In Horsleys lesson plan for teens, students learn how climate change disproportionately impacts low-income communities. They look at air quality maps in areas with higher industrial activity or car traffic.  There is a push for students to feel as though they have some ability to influence their world, Horsley said. ""Whether its conserving water or finding ways to plant more trees or take care of the trees that already exist ... they want to feel empowered.""",11/03/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oregon-eyes-mandate-climate-change-lessons-schools
"Researchers identify this mammal as latest potential cause of climate change, suggest balancing species","Researchers claim that moose are potentially a leading cause of climate change and that the species should be balanced, suggesting they are ""one of the biggest potential single sources of carbon emissions from wooded parts of Norway."" The Norwegian University of Science and Technology studied moose in Norwegian forests for several years and concluded that the species have a major effect on vegetation growth and are altering the carbon cycle by dining on tree buds. ""Moose are an ecosystem engineer in the forest ecosystem, and strongly impact everything from the species composition and nutrient availability in the forest. A grown animal can eat 50 kilograms of biomass each day during summer,"" Gunnar Austrheim, an ecologist at the NTNU University Museum, said in a press release.  Moose tend to eat birch and young samplings in clearcut forests, an act researchers claim is where the ungulates ""gobble up"" possible carbon storage in trees. ENERGY SECRETARY GRANHOLM CLAIMS US CAN LEARN FROM WHAT CHINA IS DOING ON CLIMATE CHANGE ""It was really a surprise to see how much moose can influence vegetation growth, the carbon cycle and the climate system,"" said Xiangping Hu, a researcher at NTNUs Industrial Ecology (IndEcol), said in the release. OREGON EYES MANDATE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE LESSONS IN SCHOOLS The study also claimed that moose were not only bad for the climate but aided the forest industry. The solution suggested to the latest climate change theory was to balance moose numbers and forest management in an effort to limit CO2 emissions. ""We dont only regulate the amount of animals, we very carefully regulate the proportion of females, males and calves. So theres a stronger management for moose than for most livestock in Norway,"" Francesco Cherubini, director of IndEcol Programme said. ""I think as we get more of an understanding of how all these different things are interrelated, land managers could come up with an optimal plan. That could be a much-needed win-win solution for climate, for biodiversity and for timber value."" The moose is not the first animal on climate activists labeled a potential threat to the climate after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) linked ""farting cows"" to causing climate change.   In 2019, the congresswoman suggested ""we shouldnt be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch, and dinner"" in her effort to reduce carbon emissions coming from cows. ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero, emissions in 10 years because we arent sure that well be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast,"" Ocasio-Cortez's FAQ page for the Green New Deal read.",13/03/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/researchers-identify-mammal-latest-potential-cause-climate-change-suggest-balancing-species
"UN head calls for scientist to serve 'cold, hard facts' that will push governments to curb climate change","The head of the United Nations called Monday for scientists to serve up ""cold, hard facts"" to push governments into making policies that curb climate change before a key global warming threshold is passed. His comments came as experts and officials from around the world gathered for a week-long meeting in the Swiss Alpine town of Interlaken to finalize the last of seven reports issued by the global body's panel of top scientists since the Paris climate accord was forged in 2015. In a video address to delegates, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ""could not come at a more pivotal time."" UN BRUSHES OFF CONCERNS ABOUT UPCOMING CLIMATE SUMMIT'S 'HUGE CARBON FOOTPRINT' ""Our world is at a crossroads  and our planet is in the crosshairs,"" he said. ""We are nearing the point of no return; of overshooting the internationally agreed limit of 2.7 Fahrenheit of global warming."" That threshold, agreed in Paris almost eight years ago and measured against average temperatures during pre-industrial times, has become the yardstick for climate scientists who warn of the dangers of an ever hotter planet. UN CLIMATE NEGOTIATORS POISED FOR DEAL CREATING DISASTER FUND, REPORTS SAY Guterres cited recent IPCC reports showing that while some impacts of global warming are already unavoidable, ""it is possible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees with rapid and deep emissions reductions across all sectors of the global economy."" Some scientists disagree, noting that the rate at which greenhouse gas is being pumped into the atmosphere makes this limit almost impossible to keep to. The U.N. chief said the final installment in the IPCC's sixth reporting cycle  known as the synthesis report because it brings together insights from six previous papers  should provide governments with ""solid, frank, detailed scientific guidance to make the right decisions for people and planet"" when they gather for the annual world climate conference in Dubai at the end of the year.   Guterres stressed that speeding up the phase-out of fossil fuels is ""tough but essential.""

"Biden warns people 'can't deny' climate change, 'wrath' of Mother Nature: 'Whole generation is damned'","President Biden gave a dire warning about the future while talking about climate change in a new interview. While a guest on ""The Daily Show,"" Biden told former Obama aide Kal Penn that young people between 18 and 35 years old motivated him to sign off on the Inflation Reduction Act.

Its the single-most existential threat to humanity weve ever faced, including nuclear weapons,"" Biden said during a Democratic National Committee fundraiser. Biden touted how he had urged automakers to go electric as part of his climate change plan. ""Within five weeks [of our meeting] all of them agreed they were going to go electric,"" he told Penn. In 2021, Biden signed an executive order requiring half of all new auto sales in 2030 be electric vehicles. Fox News first reported on Monday that a leaked memo from the Biden administration admitted charging fossil fuel companies less to drill would provide the country ""greater energy security.""   Despite this, the White House still planned to raise royalty fees for an oil and gas lease sale off the coast of Alaska as part of Biden's climate change agenda.

"TUCKER CARLSON: Climate change experts' bullying is not about helping the Earth, it is about controlling us","It's been a tough couple of years for the experts. When it comes to big public policy questions, complicated adult stuff like war and disease and the economy  really the only things that matter  the assumption in Washington has for many years been that you should not worry about it. Don't sweat the details. That's not your role as a citizen and as a voter. We don't have that kind of democracy, the kind where you might actually participate. No, your job is to trust the experts and their conclusions and then obey them. But COVID kind of blew that up. If there's one thing we learned from that disaster, it's that public policy experts very often had no clue what they were talking about. Your hippie aunt in Mendocino County knew a lot more about how to beat a flu virus than your average virologist on CNN. They're not going to tell you to go outside, get some exercise, some sunlight, some fresh air, stop eating junk food, turn off your computer once in a while, spend time with other people. Be healthy. That advice worked. The experts, by contrast, made you get the vaccine and that did not work.  By March of 2021, people are starting to figure this out. Anyone who was paying attention in America understood that the experts, many of them, were full of it. And it was exactly at that moment that The Atlantic Magazine in Washington published a piece pushing back against a growing consensus. That story was entitled ""Following Your Gut Isn't the Right Way to Go.""  It's hard to think of a funnier headline, really mostly because it's so spectacularly absurd. You should always trust your gut, obviously. It is the one thing that will never betray you. But The Atlantic Magazine wanted you to know that your natural instincts are, in fact, worthless. ""The experts had a rough year,"" the magazine concedes, ""but we still have to trust them."" Right.  TUCKER CARLSON: CLIMATE IS NOW OUR STATE RELIGION  Actually, we don't have to trust them and on big questions of public policy, we absolutely should not trust them. It's a democracy. But Washington is continuing to demand that we do trust them. Why? There may be a reason. Maybe COVID isn't the only big project they have in mind for us, a project the experts will justify and MSNBC. And indeed it's not. There is the climate change agenda and the climate change agenda is the single most ambitious effort to remake human civilization in all recorded history, and it's coming. In fact, it's already in progress. The only reason that millions and millions of Americans aren't protesting in the streets tonight over this effort to completely overturn their lives is that on some level, many people still do trust the experts, at least on climate change, but should they?  We were pondering that this morning when we saw that the world's most famous climate change expert, Greta Thunberg of Sweden, just deleted a tweet she wrote in June of 2018.   Here it is: ""A top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years."" That scientist, of course, was a Harvard professor so obviously that prediction was going to be correct, but here we are still driving our Silverados and still alive and some of us are still happy.  So, it does make you wonder if Greta Thunberg, the greatly revered Greta Thunberg, a perennial finalist for the Nobel Peace Prize, could have gotten that so wrong, what else have the climate experts gotten wrong and how long have they been getting it wrong? Well, fortunately, the Competitive Enterprise Institute has done the research on this, and it turns out these people have been very wrong for a very long time. In 1969, The New York Times was printing climate hysteria from an expert called Paul Ehrlich ""We must realize that unless we are extremely lucky, everybody will disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years.""  That was Paul Ehrlich in 1969. Well, here it is, 2023, and that same Paul Ehrlich, who's now 90 and still publishing books and still being cited on ""60 Minutes,"" is still telling us that we're all going to die. Now, clearly, Paul Ehrlich had some sort of traumatic childhood. He's been inflicting it on the rest of us for over 50 years, and for 50 years, his fellow experts have taken him seriously.  Now, back then, of course, climate change didn't mean global warming. It meant a new ice age. In 1970, The Boston Globe reported, ""Scientists predict a new ice Age by 21st century."" According to the Globe, ""air pollution may obliterate the sun and cause a new ice age in the first third of the next century."" An ice age!  SCIENTISTS REVIVE ANCIENT ZOMBIE VIRUSES FROM SIBERIAN PERMAFROST THAT CAN INFECT AMOEBA CELLS  In 1972, Brown University's science department sent a letter to the White House explaining that they had ""deep concern with the future of the world because this ice age falls within the rank of processes which produced the last Ice Age."" Two years later, in 1974, the Guardian reported, ""Spy satellites show new ice age is coming fast"" and the report cited for moral weight analysis carried out at Columbia University. Then, a few years later, 1977, the actor Leonard Nimoy  who was not a science expert technically, but played one at one point on television  shot this video.  LEONARD NIMOY: If we are unprepared for the next advance, the result could be hunger and death on a scale unprecedented in all of history. What scientists are telling us now is that the threat of an ice age is not as remote as they once thought. During the lifetime of our grandchildren, arctic cold and perpetual snow could turn most of the inhabitable portions of our planet into a polar desert.   Hunger and death are an unprecedented scale! Someone else with a tragic childhood he inflicted on the rest of us. But by the early 1980s, when the ice didn't arrive well, the expert decided the problem wasn't too much cold. It was too much heat. It was global warming. In 1989, the Associated Press ran this story ""A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000."" In other words, 23 years ago.  That same year, 1989, a climate expert called Jim Hansen met with a reporter from Salon. According to Salon, Hansen explained that within 20 or 30 years, ""The West Side Highway, which runs along the Hudson River in Manhattan, will be underwater,"" Underwater! We checked tonight, and actually it's congested, but still a road.  Then in March of 2000, the Independent newspaper had a piece explaining that snowfalls are now just a thing of the past: ""Snow is starting to disappear from our lives."" The piece quoted a climate expert claiming that ""children just aren't going to know what snow is."" No idea what snow is! It'll be a relic of the Ice Age, but of the great inferno of global warming.   RESEARCHERS IDENTIFY THIS MAMMAL AS LATEST POTENTIAL CAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, SUGGEST BALANCING SPECIES  Then in 2004, amazingly, civilization still existed. The Guardian predicted that, ""Major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a Siberian climate by 2020""  which is a little confusing because global warming doesn't typically produce a Siberian climate. And it was around this time that they decided, ""Hey, we don't want to get pinned down on the details. Will it be too hot? Will it be too cold? We don't want to say. Something bad is going to happen, so we're going to call it climate change."" And that paved the way for Al Gore, who in 2006 released his famous documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth."" The beauty of An Inconvenient Truth is now that it's been well, inconveniently more than 15 years since it came out, we can fact-check its claims. Here's the trailer.  AL GORE: If you look at the ten hottest years ever measured, they've all occurred in the last 14 years and the hottest of all was 2005. This is Patagonia 75 years ago and the same glacier today. This is Mount Kilimanjaro 30 years ago and last year. Within the decade, there will be no more ""Snows of Kilimanjaro.""  Al Gore also said there would be no ice in the Arctic. He quoted researchers, climate researchers, experts, and he explained that, ""The North Pole will be ice-free in the Summer by 2013 because of manmade global warming."" Now, it does take a certain level of hutzpah to make a prediction that precise and Al Gore made many of them and all of them turned out to be wrong and for a normal person, that would be a cue maybe it's time to retire. I'm rich on Google stock. Maybe I could just stop talking because, of course, I've been disgraced by my own foolish predictions, But no, he kept going, and he was helped in that by the entire news media. It makes you wonder why? News organizations exist to bring you the news, to assess whether things are true or not, but if all of them collude to hide lying, you have to ask, is there something else going on here? We will let you decide. We do know that by 2006, NBC News informed the world that, ""a leading U.S. climate researcher says the world has a ten-year window"" (till 2016) ""a window of opportunity to take decisive action on global warming and avert catastrophe."" Of course, by their predicted date, Donald Trump became president, but that's not what they were predicting.   In 2008, the Associated Press reported that according to a top NASA scientist, ""in 5 to 10 years, the Arctic will be free of sea ice in the summer."" That didn't happen, but of course, no one was ever held to account for bad predictions. So, this kept going. John Kerry, now our climate czar, cited that very same science in 2009. Watch.   REPUBLICANS DEMAND BIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY RETRACT 'UNSERIOUS' COMMENTS PRAISING CHINA  JOHN KERRY: You have sea ice, which is melting at a rate that the Arctic Ocean now increasingly is exposed. In five years, scientists predict we will have the first ice-free Arctic summer.   What's hilarious is this is a guy who's never had a job. He's only been in politics. He never did one useful thing. He's not a scientist. He has never done research. He's actually not an expert. But because he's way more aggressive than you are and because he has access to the media, which amplify his claims, he poses as one.  Now, what's strange about the prediction you just heard is that John Kerry's prediction contradicts Barack Obama's famous climate prediction from a year earlier. You probably remember this.  BARACK OBAMA: Because if we are willing to work for it and fight for it and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs for the jobless. This was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.   Sad to watch that. All the cheering people, they seem so sincere. He's going to save the world and control the weather. He's Jesus. But in fact, the global healing Obama promised at the beginning of his first term never came and neither the global destruction. Here, by the way, is Neil deGrasse Tyson, another great predictor of things, saying that by 2014, the Statue of Liberty will soon be underwater.   NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: You know what I tell people? This really wakes them. Here in the New York metropolitan area, I say, you know, if we lose the ice caps, you know how high the water will be? ""Oh maybe a couple of feet."" No, it would come up to the Statue of Libertys elbow, the one that's holding the Declaration of Independence. That's where the waterline will be.   That man is a scientist and of course, climate does change it, as always, change. In fact, the landscape we live in now is formed by climate change. The glaciers are a product of climate change. The climate is changing now. It never stops changing. That is a process that we didn't cause and that we can't control to any great degree, we will never be able to control and there are upsides to it and downsides to it.   By the way, if the Earth is indeed getting warmer and it seems to be, well, then that will make more arable land in places like Canada and Northern Europe. So, like everything in this life in the temporal world, it's a mixed blessing, but you only hear the downsides, which tells you a lot. It tells you this is not science. It's manipulation. These aren't reports from the experts. These are threats. Here's Joe Biden.     PRESIDENT BIDEN: That's what climate change is about. It is literally, not figuratively, a clear and present danger. The latest climate report, nothing less than ""code red for humanity."" Let me say it again, code red for humanity.   Code red for humanity! Of course, he never explains what that means. You're going to have to check your book of science to find out.  Of course, in the details, they don't offer as many details now because they've all been wrong, but the extent they do, they are provably wrong over time. So, the question is, why are we still being bullied by these people? It has nothing to do with saving the Earth. They hate the Earth. They hate nature. It's about controlling us, and maybe we should recognize that.",16/03/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-climate-change-experts-bullying-helping-earth-controlling-us
Navy secretary cited climate change as top priority as Biden proposes shrinking the fleet,"Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said he sees fighting climate change as a top priority for the Navy as the Biden administration proposes shrinking the fleet by two ships and worries grow about how the U.S. Navy stacks up to Chinas. ""As the Secretary of the Navy, I can tell you that I have made climate one of my top priorities since the first day I came into office,"" Del Toro said March 1 in remarks at the University of the Bahamas. Del Toro said he met with Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis during his visit and spoke ""at length"" with him about the climate crisis and focused the bulk of his remarks on climate. ""The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps team has been working on climate and energy security for a long time,"" he said. ""And we are accelerating and broadening those efforts."" NAVY RENAMES SHIP OVER TIES TO CONFEDERATE OFFICER ""We view the climate crisis much the same way as damage control efforts on a stricken ship. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,"" he added. Del Toro spoke just days before the Biden administration released its proposed budget for 2024, which calls for shrinking the Navy fleet even though most military experts and senior Navy officers have called for more ships to deter China's larger fleet.  For several years now, the Navy has set a goal of having 355 manned ships. But, for the last three years, the Biden administration has proposed shrinking the fleet below the roughly 298 ships it has available now, instead of increasing it toward a 355-ship goal. CHINA OUTPACING US IN WARSHIP PRODUCTION, NAVY SECRETARY WARNS This year, the Biden budget called for the decommissioning of 11 ships and the construction of just nine ships, for a net loss of two vessels. That budget proposal was met with skepticism from members of Congress, which has acted in the last two years to spare the Navy from cuts to the fleet proposed by the Biden administration. ""No matter the favored phrase of the day  divest to invest, strategic pause, capability over capacity,  the presidents defense budget is, in practice, sinking our future fleet,"" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""A strong naval footing begins with readiness today and a plan to grow our battle force and command the seas tomorrow. President Biden is risking our maritime security by declining to work toward either of these goals."" As the Navy budget was being prepped for release, Del Toro was stressing the importance of using the Navy to fight climate change in the Bahamas and noting the many approaching climate-related events in which the Navy will participate. US NAVY INTERCEPTS FISHING VESSEL TRYING TO SMUGGLE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL FROM IRAN TO YEMEN ""There is not a trade-off between addressing climate security and our core mission of being the most capable and ready Navy-Marine Corps team,"" he said. ""The exact opposite is true. Embracing climate-focused technologies and adopting a climate-informed posture strengthens our capability to stand by our partners and allies."" Del Toro said worrying about climate change would lead to new technologies that the Navy can use to create a ""virtuous cycle of energy efficiency, cost savings, maritime dominance and climate security."" He noted that Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry was just in the Bahamas and that he was going to meet with Kerry in Panama at the ""Our Oceans Conference."" And he said the USNS Comfort, a 1,000-bed medical ship, is often in the Caribbean to help with ""climate-charged disasters."" Del Toro said the chief of naval research would host a conference in Florida in April that will focus on how to ""address climate change and marine pollution, renew and hybrid energies applied to the naval field and integrating unmanned systems.""  ""Climate change is one of the, if not the, most complex issues we have ever faced  as individuals, as nations and as a species,"" he said.

UN secretary general warns 'humanity is on thin ice' following climate change report,"United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres issued a stark warning on climate change, warning the ""time bomb is ticking"" on the heels of a new climate report.  The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its ""synthesis report"" Monday detailing the impact humanity has had on climate change and what needs to be done to counter the shift.  ""Humanity is on thin ice, and the ice is melting fast,"" Guterres said during a recorded address. ""Humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. The rate of temperature rising in the last half century is the highest in 2,000 years."" UN CALLS FOR SCIENTIST TO SERVE COLD, HARD FACTS THAT WILL PUSH GOVERNMENTS TO CURB CLIMATE CHANGE ""Concentrations of carbon dioxide are at their highest in at least two million years,"" he continued. ""The climate time bomb is ticking."" He detailed how the world would need to endure a ""quantum leap in climate action"" to reverse course, but argued it is possible if all countries are aligned socially and economically to mitigate the trend.  Developed countries should cease utilizing fossil fuel energy sources sooner rather than later, he warned, urging them to reach no net emissions by 2040.  A series of international scientists worked on the IPCC report, which was analyzed base on years of comprehensive research. Gutterres called the report, which serves as a baseline for policymakers, a ""survival guide for humanity.""  The IPCC's findings, detailed in the 37-page report, serve as the foundation for climate negotiations in the Paris Climate Accord.  The report found that greenhouse gas emissions have increased courtesy of ""unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles, and patterns of consumption and production.""    The data indicated that in order for the world to halt surpassing the targeted warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), the globe must reduce emissions in half.  And if emissions are not reduced significantly, the warming limit will surpass the 1.5 degree Celsius goal in the coming years, potentially by 2035.  President Biden echoed Guterres' sentiment on the limit earlier this month during a sit down interview on ""The Daily Show."" ""If we don't keep the temperature from going above 1.5 degrees Celsius, raised, then we're in real trouble,"" he said. ""That whole generation is damned. Thats not hyperbole. Really truly in trouble."" Biden warned the climate crisis remains a larger threat than nuclear warfare during a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in January.

UN report predicting climate catastrophe in 2030 met with mockery: 'Every single prediction' has been 'wrong',"The United Nations released a report on Monday that that claimed the planet will approach a catastrophic threshold in the 2030s unless further action is taken. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization convened by the United Nations, authored the report, which included a warning that temperatures are expected to rise to levels that could cause disastrous weather events. ""It says that global average temperatures are estimated to rise 1.5C above preindustrial levels sometime around the first half of the 2030s, as humans continue to burn coal, oil and natural gas,"" the New York Times reported. ""That number holds a special significance in global climate politics: Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, virtually every nation agreed to pursue efforts to hold global warming to 1.5C. Beyond that point, scientists say, the impacts of catastrophic heat waves, flooding, drought, crop failures and species extinction become significantly harder for humanity to handle."" Though the report contained dire predictions if the temperatures rise above 1.5 degrees, many Twitter users dismissed the headline as another hyperbolic claim by the ""climate cult."" LIBERAL MEDIA MADE SLEW OF DUBIOUS CLAIMS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, YEAR-END REPORT FINDS  National Review contributor Pradheep Shanker wrote, ""I'll believe environmentalists truly believe this as soon as they start demanding we build every nuclear reactor we possibly can to avert this crisis. And not a second before. With nuclear, we can bend this curve in less than a generation."" ""Any minute now!"" American Spectator published Melissa McKenzie joked. ""EVERY single prediction the Climate Cult has made has been WRONG. Every. Single. One. These people need to be shut down. All they are doing is HARMING the world,"" journalist Kimberly Morin wrote. Combat veteran and author Sean Parnell tweeted, ""Climate apocalypse has been 5-10 years away for the last 70 years. These Radical Greens are crazy."" ""Quick- everyone jump on their private jets to discuss this *immediately*!"" author Carol Roth wrote. Podcast host Ahmed Al Assliken explained, ""AOC promised it was going to happen sometime in 2018. Al Gore said it was 2014. BREAKING NEWS: These people are lying to you and scamming you with fear."" UN SECRETARY GENERAL WARNS HUMANITY IS ON THIN ICE FOLLOWING CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT  However, others took the report seriously as a warning and advocated for more action from the Biden Administration to combat climate change. ""Because were ran by psychopaths, we wont do anything and the consequences will be severe for all,"" Youth Victory Fund founder Elijah Manley tweeted. Author Nolen Gertz wrote, ""Very distressing to see all the replies saying We've heard this before but we're not dead yet! It's almost like people feel some desperate need to find ways to escape from having to confront reality. If only there was a word for that instead of just an emoji... _()_/ "" ""One party doesn't believe in climate change, and the other party's president just signed off on the equivalent of adding 1.7 million cars to the road.

Teen Vogue writer Lexi Mcmenamin agreed, ""good thing our president just completely backtracked on popular will and approved an oil and gas project in Alaska right next to an indigenous community that specifically rejected it! that will produce the same carbon emissions as ~2 million cars on road!"" In a recorded address after the reports release, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the ""climate time bomb is ticking.""

UN calls for mass fossil fuel shutdowns to prevent 'climate time bomb',"The United Nations (U.N.) published its latest climate change report Monday, which doubled down on global warming-related risks and which the intergovernmental organization dubbed a ""survival guide for humanity."" The synthesis report, assembled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), represents the U.N.'s latest attempt to sound the alarm on the risks posed by climate change and not taking aggressive actions to halt global warming. According to the document, ""unsustainable energy and land use"" has caused the world to warm 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, close to the 1.5-degree emergency threshold. ""The rate of temperature rise in the last half-century is the highest in 2,000 years,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a video message Monday. ""Concentrations of carbon dioxide are at their highest in at least 2 million years. The climate time bomb is ticking. But todays IPCC report is a how-to guide to defuse the climate time bomb. It is a survival guide for humanity."" ""As it shows, the 1.5-degree limit is achievable. But it will take a quantum leap in climate action,"" he continued. ""This report is a clarion call to massively fast-track climate efforts by every country and every sector and on every time frame. In short, our world needs climate action on all fronts, everything, everywhere, all at once."" CHINA UNLEASHES MASSIVE COAL POWER EXPANSION DESPITE JOHN KERRY'S CLIMATE PLEAS The report stated that every additional increment of warming that occurs will result in ""rapidly escalating hazards"" for humanity. For example, it warned that climate change will spur more intense heatwaves, heavier rainfall and other extreme risks to human health and ecosystems. And food insecurity will increase while additional conflicts and pandemics will be harder to manage, the report said. ""Mainstreaming effective and equitable climate action will not only reduce losses and damages for nature and people, it will also provide wider benefits,"" IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee said in a statement. ""This Synthesis Report underscores the urgency of taking more ambitious action and shows that, if we act now, we can still secure a liveable sustainable future for all."" ""Transformational changes are more likely to succeed where there is trust, where everyone works together to [prioritize] risk reduction, and where benefits and burdens are shared equitably,"" Lee added. ""We live in a diverse world in which everyone has different responsibilities and different opportunities to bring about change. Some can do a lot while others will need support to help them manage the change."" JOHN KERRY'S SECRET CCP NEGOTIATIONS PROBED BY GOP OVERSIGHT CHAIRMAN The IPCC report further called for a massive investment in clean energy and an immediate phasing out of fossil fuels across the world. The U.N. also called on Western nations to boost the amount of capital and financing they devote to climate investments. During the most recent U.N. climate conference in November, nations committed to billions of dollars worth of climate financing for developing countries and rallied to call on private investors to boost climate financing. However, fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas still account for the vast majority of worldwide energy consumption, according to the latest International Energy Agency data. The three sources produce nearly 70% of all global energy and a large majority of electricity generation, which accounts for another 17% of energy produced.  ""Every country must be part of the solution,"" Guterres added Monday. ""Demanding others move first only ensures humanity comes last. The Acceleration Agenda calls for a number of other actions. Specifically, no new coal and the phasing out of coal by 2030 in OECD countries and 2040 in all other countries; ending all international public and private funding of coal."" ""Ceasing all licensing or funding of new oil and gas  consistent with the findings of the International Energy Agency,"" he continued. ""Stopping any expansion of existing oil and gas reserves; shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to a just energy transition; establishing a global phasedown of existing oil and gas production compatible with the 2050 global net-zero target.""",20/03/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/un-calls-mass-fossil-fuel-shutdowns-prevent-climate-time-bomb
This blue city wants to ban new gas and auto service stations over climate change,"A Colorado city is considering a resolution that would ban new gas stations and automobile service stations to combat climate change. The proposed ordinance before the City Council also seeks to cap the number of gas stations and service stations for Louisville, Colorado, to six, with a seventh being permitted only if it's part of a large retail center. ""We have an obligation to take every step possible to address the changes to our climate that are ravaging our planet and directly impacting the health, well-being and livelihoods of the constituents we represent in Louisville,"" council member Maxine Most told Fox News. HOW CLIMATE ALARMISM IS MAKING PEOPLE CHILDLESS BY CHOICE: WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE The City Council document that includes the ordinance defines automobile service stations as a business ""engaged in the sale of motor fuels and in supplying goods and services generally required in the operation and maintenance of automotive vehicles and the fulfilling of motorists' needs."" It adds that ""major automotive repairs, painting, body and fender work are prohibited."" New gas stations and service stations will also be required to have at least two charging stations for electric vehicles and be 1,000 feet from existing stations unless they are part of a large retail center, according to the ordinance. Louisville, a Denver suburb with about 21,000 residents, currently has five gas stations with a sixth recently approved for construction. SERIAL GAS STOVE USER STACEY ABRAMS TROLLED FOR JOINING GROUP THAT WANTS TO BAN THEM The Louisville Sustainability Advisory Board reviewed the proposal earlier this month, recommending that the ordinance reduce the number of stations to five and remove the exception for an additional station for a large retailer. Limiting stations is a growing trend for local municipalities ""due to health and environmental concerns with the continued use of gasoline powered vehicles and equipment,"" the document's analysis section states. It points to California municipalities that have passed similar restrictions, like Petaluma, Santa Rosa in Sonoma County. UN REPORT PREDICTING CLIMATE CATASTROPHE IN 2030 MET WITH MOCKERY: 'EVERY SINGLE PREDICTION' HAS BEEN 'WRONG' ""Gasoline station bans may also be seen as promoting the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs), thus, reducing vehicle emissions and encouraging low-carbon and cleaner energy options for transportation,"" the ordinance adds.

"Climate scientist echoes UN warning that 'humanity is on thin ice,' says previous predictions were not wrong","""PBS Newshour"" invited climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe to discuss climate change predictions following the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on Monday. The IPCC, an organization of experts convened by the United Nations, published an extensive report warning about the disastrous effects that global warming predictions are expected to have on humanity by the early 2030s. Many social media users have called out these claims, pointing out that past climate doom predictions have been wrong for decades. However, Hayhoe insisted the predictions were not wrong and instead the ""uncertainty"" comes from humanity. ""The previous predictions were not wrong. The uncertainty is us. The predictions were for what will happen depending on the choices we make. Prior to the Paris Agreement in 2015, the world was heading towards a future that was between four to five degrees Celsius warmer than today,"" Hayhoe said. ""You might say, well, that does not sound that bad, its four or five degrees warmer. But think of it in terms of the human body. The temperature of the planet has been as stable as that of the human body over the course of human civilization. If our body is running a fever of one or two degrees Celsius, or four to six degrees Celsius, that is life-threatening.""  UN REPORT PREDICTING CLIMATE CATASTROPHE IN 2030 MET WITH MOCKERY: EVERY SINGLE PREDICTION HAS BEEN WRONG  She insisted, ""We have already, thanks to the Paris Agreement, reduced the amount of change we can expect by policies enacted by at least one degree. But we still need more, because every bit of warming carries a cost with it."" Nawaz commented on United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres statement also made that day when he warned that the ""climate time bomb is ticking."" ""Humanity is on thin ice, and the ice is melting fast,"" Guterres said. ""Humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. The rate of temperature rising in the last half century is the highest in 2,000 years."" Hayhoe commented that the ""dire"" warning from Guterres is ""completely justified."" ""It is completely justified. We scientists have been warning about the impacts of climate change on humans, and all other life on this planet, for decades. Yet our carbon emissions continue to rise. As the IPCC report says, the window of opportunity we have to make decisions that will lead us to a better future is closing rapidly,"" Hayhoe said. UN SECRETARY GENERAL WARNS HUMANITY IS ON THIN ICE FOLLOWING CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT Although Hayhoe did not provide any specific suggestions on what can be done to counter climate change, she insisted that ""it is possible"" and that ""the only question at this point is what are we waiting for."" ""Were already seeing the impacts today in the way climate change is loading the weather dice against us. We know weve always had floods and droughts and hurricanes and heat waves, but, in a warming world, they are getting stronger and more dangerous. And they are impacting all of us, but that are particularly affecting those who are vulnerable and marginalized the most. The warmer the world gets, the more it endangers our food supply, our water supply, the safety of our homes, our own health, our economy and supply chains, the natural environment. Every aspect of life on earth, including our life on earth, is at risk the warmer this planet gets,"" Hayhoe said. She concluded, ""Climate change no longer a future issue. It is right here where we live. It is right now, and the time to fix it is also here and now.""  Back in 2019, the conservative-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute put together a lengthy compilation of apocalyptic predictions dating back decades that did not come to pass.",21/03/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/media/climate-scientist-says-previous-predictions-climate-change-not-wrong
GREG GUTFELD: So-called experts 'keep moving the goalposts' on climate change 'catastrophe',"Happy Wednesday, everyone, especially since we don't have many Wednesdays left. Yeah, it's that time again, the end is nigh all hope is lost. No, Steve Doocy didn't get his own show, although Bill Hemmer found out I've been stealing his running shorts from the break room. But forget about inflation or our increasingly bellicose adversaries. Pay no mind to fentanyl, the rising crime rate or drag queen story hour. That was a mistake.  I'm talking about Mother Nature, and, boy, it's become a mother. Of course, this real threat to humanity, it's never really gone away. Its delivery day just keeps getting changed. The New York Times delivers this ominous warning, Climate Change is Speeding toward Catastrophe, the Next Decade is Crucial, the U.N. panel says. ""Earth is likely to cross a critical threshold for global warming within the next decade and nations will need to make an immediate and drastic shift away from fossil fuels to prevent the planet from overheating dangerously beyond that level, according to a major new report released on Monday."" A new report, right? Huh? It eerily sounds like the same one Al Gore and the rest of these lying, fear mongering ---- have been screaming at us for the last 40 years. Yeah!  CALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM STRIKES DEAL TO PUNISH FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES AFTER FIRST PROPOSAL REJECTED Hey, but so what? Right? You peasants need to suffer, or the whole world will be doomed. Except that the Times drops this not so subtle caveat that contradicts the whole report. ""Many scientists have,"" you know they ""pointed out that surpassing the 1.5 degree threshold will not mean humanity is doomed."" Wait a second, so, wait, we're not doomed? Holly ----. Why didn't you just say so to begin with? Now, I'm sure that this so-called threshold is arbitrary, just the thing every fear merchant can agree on. It's funny, though, the headline screams catastrophe, but then halfway through it, they say never mind.  The shocking news isn't so shocking at all. Imagine if that's how I called 911, huh? Hello? Everyone's going to die. Why? My fan broke. What a bunch of shock blockers. Anyway, it's not as if there was ever any climate change before we all decided we were killing the planet. It's not like 12,000 years ago there was a giant glacier right where I'm sitting, but no one blamed that on one of my many yachts. But we've been down this road before, like, every few years, like, for my entire life, and I'm 85 years old. I know I look great, it's all about hydration and a healthy sex life. Isn't that right, Melinda?  But these experts keep moving the goalposts because they're worse at predicting the end of the world than the Mayans. 2012 was the last time I donated to charity because I thought the world was ending. What's the point, huh? Kids are going to die. They pick the year everything ends, and then that deadline passes. Then, coincidentally, Greta Thunberg deletes her tweet about it and the climate crooks have to pick a new date, and then they start fending for their doomsday fix once again. They say the sky is falling when the only thing falling is this guy on the stairs of Air Force One. Terrible, but how often are we to keep hearing this. GRETA THUNBERG TELLS 'VIEW' HOSTS THAT CLIMATE ACTIVISTS MUST NOW GO BEYOND 'LEGAL METHODS' ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ 2019: The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change? Yeah, right. If that's true, why are you in such great shape? I mean, if the world's ending, there's no need for a beach body. Hell, I'd blow up like Brian Stelter and die in a bed made of chocolate eclairs. But imagine if it wasn't climate ideology being pushed, but something just as fallible like a Ponzi scheme, but we were forced to treat it with this solemn respect: Oh, look, the Bernie Madoff Institute for Financial Wisdom has just released its latest findings and yes, you need to give more money to the Bernie Madoff Institute for Financial Wisdom. That's climate activism. Bottom line, you can never trust an addict, even a climate change one. The apocalypse is always around the corner, then we turn that corner and nothing. So then it's the next corner, and the next, they got more corners than a haunted corn maze. And why?  Because it's incentivized. You do this grift, the world opens up to you. You don't get adulation if you speak soberly on crime or nuclear energy. Climate's different, though. Greta Thunberg is getting an honorary doctorate, even though she's literally famous for skipping school. She's like Ferris Bueller, but without the misfortune of marrying Sarah Jessica Parker. But that's an incentive not just for attention starved kids, but for attention starved adults as well. The former teen will receive the award from the Faculty of Theology at the University of Helsinki. She's the first one to hold the title of doctor while also needing one. But theology?   Now if I remember my Greek, and I remember a lot of Greeks, that's from the word Theo, which means Dr. Cliff Huxtables' only son. Wait, no, Theo means God. It's the study of Gods. I wonder how many times my name comes up in the textbooks, right? I mean, that, I guess that means they're finally admitting climate change is truly a religion, and it is, just like Jonestown.",23/03/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-experts-keep-climate-change-catastrophe
UN climate report is latest in string of cataclysmic predictions stretching back decades,"The United Nations (U.N.) issued its latest climate change report which warned the ""climate time bomb is ticking,"" sparking renewed calls for nations including the U.S. to take more aggressive actions to curb carbon emissions. The report, published Monday by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), concluded that sustained global fossil fuel usage has caused the world to warm 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, close to the 1.5-degree emergency threshold, and has pushed the world closer to a point of no return. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the report represented the most stark warning for humanity yet. ""The climate time bomb is ticking. But todays IPCC report is a how-to guide to defuse the climate time bomb. It is a survival guide for humanity,"" he said. ""As it shows, the 1.5-degree limit is achievable. But it will take a quantum leap in climate action."" Following the report, news outlets highlighted the findings and included comments from additional climate experts and environmentalists who said the report should be a final warning and that ""there is no more room for compromises."" And White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday called the report a ""sobering report on the state of our climate.""  DEMOCRATS BLAMING CLIMATE CHANGE FOR HURRICANE IAN AT ODDS WITH SCIENCE, EXPERTS SAY However, the IPCC's report is just the most recent in a long string of cataclysmic climate change warnings and calls to action from the U.N. dating back decades. The international body first called attention to emissions-caused climate change during its 1972 First Earth Summit in Sweden and zeroed in on the issue in the late 1980s when it began issuing its first major warnings about global warming. ""The ticking time bomb stuff  I mean, they really are running out of extreme rhetoric,"" Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow at the Energy &amp; Environment Legal Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""What's the rhetoric going to be like next time or is it just going to be the same? I guess it could just be the same. We could have another stark, stark warning."" ""Since they never report that they've been wrong before, it doesn't really matter. They just go on to the next one,"" he continued. ""This is an elitist-driven scare. It's very important to the green energy industry, to the greens and to Democrats, but it's not really important to anybody else. I think people are kind of getting bored with it."" BIDEN CONSIDERING TEARING DOWN KEY GREEN ENERGY SOURCE OVER ECO CONCERNS In 1989, Noel Brown, the former director of the U.N. Environment Program, told The Associated Press that entire nations would be wiped off the face of the Earth by 2000 if warming trends aren't reversed. He added that if warming wasn't reduced, humanity could expect ""more ferocious storms, hurricanes, wind shear, dust erosion."" One year later, the IPCC published its First Assessment Report which stated with certainty that human activity, namely the burning of fossil fuels for energy, ""will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface."" The report also predicted that increases in emissions could cause ""irreversible change in the climate which could be detectable"" by 2000. The IPCC continued publishing reports with stark warnings and bold predictions throughout the 1990s and 2000s.  ""Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human activities continue to alter the atmosphere in ways that are expected to affect the climate,"" the agency's Third Assessment Report published in 2001 stated. ""There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."" REPUBLICANS DEMAND BIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY RETRACT 'UNSERIOUS' COMMENTS PRAISING CHINA In 2007, the IPCC released its Fourth Assessment Report which gave the world eight more years to reverse warming and emissions trends to avoid the worst effects of climate change.  Seven years later, the Fifth Assessment Report stated the increased emissions were ""increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people andecosystems."" ""Time is running out. The more we delay, the more we will pay. Climate change is accelerating and human activities are the principal cause, as documented in a series of authoritative scientific reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,"" former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wrote at the time. ""Climate change poses sweeping risks for economic stability and the security of nations.""  Then, in 2019, U.N. General Assembly President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garcia said ""11 years are all that remain to avert catastrophe,"" giving the Earth until 2030. During the same event, Guterres said ""we have no excuse not to act."" And last year, the U.N. warned in a sustainable development report that, to avoid irreversible damage, global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak before 2025, decline 43% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050. Despite the years of warnings, though, the world has continued to see increased carbon emissions and fossil fuel production. In 2022, energy-related carbon emissions reached an all-time high and global oil consumption is projected to reach an all-time high of 101.7 million barrels per day in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.",26/03/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/un-climate-report-latest-string-cataclysmic-predictions-stretching-back-decades
This Supreme Court ruling could upend everything about climate change lawsuits,"Federal courts of appeals cannot agree whether climate change lawsuits are governed by state or federal law. Some federal courts have also concluded these cases should proceed in state court, an outcome Judge David Stras  a respected jurist on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit  just last week called ""confounding,"" even if correct. Its time for the Supreme Court to intervene. For over a century, the Supreme Court has held that lawsuits over air (and water) pollution that crosses state lines must be decided under federal law. This means overreaching states and cities cannot impose their environmental agendas on their neighbors or otherwise hijack the domain of federal environmental law, federal regulations and international treaties.  The Supreme Court unanimously extended this principle in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut (AEP). That case, decided in 2011, involved federal-law claims by eight states, New York City and others to compel certain power companies to abate their greenhouse-gas emissions.  In an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court concluded that applying federal law was appropriate, then agreed with the Obama administration that those claims couldnt proceed in court at all because Congress has delegated the regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act.  BIDEN ENERGY SECRETARY DEFENDS PRAISING CHINA ON CLIMATE CHANGE SPENDING IN FIERY HEARING EXCHANGE Dissatisfied with AEP, progressive states and cities have since changed tack in their litigation offensive against energy companies. In recent years they have launched a new frenzy of lawsuits demanding billions of dollars for damages allegedly related to past, present and future climate change. But this time, instead of relying on federal law, they have tried invoking state law. The 2nd Circuit in 2021 dismissed such claims outright in City of New York v. Chevron Corp. There, New York City sued a handful of energy companies under state law for damages allegedly caused by climate change. The court concluded that ""over a century"" of Supreme Court precedent makes clear that federal law necessarily applies to lawsuits relating to air pollution that crosses state lines, which includes greenhouse-gas emissions. Following AEP, the Second Circuit dismissed the case. That 2nd Circuit decision creates a split with the 1st, 4th and 10th Circuits, which have held that state law may apply to climate change lawsuits. Further complicating matters, a second split has developed after plaintiffs began bringing these state claims in state court, where they think the judges will be more sympathetic. Decisions in the 2nd, 5th and 11th Circuits support allowing the defendants to move such cases to federal court, but the 3rd, 4th, 8th, 9th and 10th Circuits disagree. Three of these cases are now before the Supreme Court: the 3rd Circuits decision in Delaware v. BP America Inc., the 9th Circuits decision in Chevron Corp. v. San Mateo County and the 10th Circuits decision in Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Boulder County. The energy companies in each case have asked the court to intervene and resolve both splits, reaffirming that climate change lawsuits are inherently governed by federal law and therefore belong in federal court.  A circuit split significantly increases the likelihood the Supreme Court will review a case, something progressives are desperate to avoid after their crushing (and unanimous) loss in AEP. So, in an effort to escape this review at all costs, they now minimize the splits in authority. They entirely discount the 2nd Circuits decision in City of New York, for example, because the plaintiffs there chose to file in federal court, rather than state court. But that distinction has no bearing on whether federal law inherently governs climate change lawsuits.  More importantly, even if there is no circuit split  and there are two  the stakes are simply too high for the Supreme Court to ignore.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Climate change lawsuits are currently pending against dozens of major energy companies in states across the country, including Rhode Island, New York, Maryland, Washington, California and Hawaii. These cases are undisguised ""lawfare,"" which is a cynical ploy by environmental activists to achieve through courts what they cannot accomplish at the federal ballot box.  Judge Stras recognized the litigation as nothing more than an ""attempt to set national energy policy"" and ""'effectively override... the policy choices made by' the federal government and other states."" It threatens to interfere with U.S. energy independence, national security and economic growth. It is well established that the Supreme Court will decide cases presenting ""important"" questions of federal law. The court has heard many such cases without circuit splits, including on ObamaCare, vaccine mandates, and, as particularly relevant here, greenhouse-gas emissions. The importance of the law governing climate change litigation, and where those cases should proceed, is no different. Even Judge Stras called out for the court to get involved.  Progressive state and local officials should not be able to use their state laws and state courts to manipulate energy policy and hold every other state, the federal government, and the national energy supply hostage to their climate agendas.  The Supreme Court has a chance in BP America, Chevron Corp. or Suncor Energy to stop an abusive litigation practice, resolve circuit splits and preserve over a century of its precedent. It shouldnt hesitate to do so. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY C. BOYDEN GRAY Amb. C.

Youth UN adviser says climate change needs to be treated like COVID-19: 'An emergency',"A youth United Nations (UN) climate adviser is calling for world leaders to treat global warming with the same mandates used to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Sophia Kianni, who is the UN's youngest adviser, said in a tweet earlier this week that more than 80% of the global population is being ""impacted"" by climate change and that it warranted an emergency response. ""Remember when we treated COVID-19 like an emergency?"" Kianni tweeted Monday evening. ""Well its time to do the same for climate change, over 80% of the world's population is being impacted from Climate Change!"" Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, governments implemented wide-reaching mandates and economic shutdowns, which led to massive job losses and supply chain problems, in an effort to prevent further spread of the disease. Such shutdowns were heavily criticized for their negative impacts on the global economy and education outcomes. GOP OPENS INVESTIGATION INTO BIDEN ADMIN FOR OBSTRUCTING US ENERGY PRODUCERS WITH 'RADICAL ECO-AGENDA' However, actions taken to defeat the pandemic  such as limiting travel and forcing individuals to stay at home  ultimately curbed carbon emissions and energy consumption, a priority activists have pushed. In 2020, the U.S. emitted 4.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, a staggering 11% year-over-year decline and the lowest level since 1983, according to federal data. WHITE HOUSE BLAMES PREDECESSORS FOR BIDEN APPROVING MASSIVE OIL DRILLING PROJECT ""If we can think about how to prepare for climate change like a pandemic, maybe there will be a positive outcome to all of this,"" CoolClimate Network developer Christopher Jones told NBC News in 2020 amid COVID-19 shutdowns. ""We can help prevent crises in the future if we are prepared. I think there are some big-picture lessons here that could be very useful."" ""This is a huge opportunity for countries that import fossil fuels which can save trillions of dollars by switching to a clean energy economy in line with the Paris Agreement,"" energy strategist Kingsmill Bond added months later. ""Now is the time to plan an orderly wind-down of fossil fuel assets and manage the impact on the global economy rather than try to sustain the unsustainable.""  Kianni, who is also the founder of the international climate group Climate Cardinals, meanwhile, made headlines last year after she delivered remarks at the UN annual climate conference in Egypt. During the speech, she blasted world leaders for continuing to allow new oil and gas leasing, calling for more aggressive actions to combat global warming.

Democrats turn climate change into the next mental health crisis,"House Democrats are warning that the impending climate crisis they have been predicting for years means more than rising tides, devastating storms and economic upheaval  it also means a growing mental health crisis for young Americans as they learn about and prepare to face these challenges. Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., introduced a resolution that calls on Congress to take aggressive steps to ""protect the mental health and well-being of current and future youth"" in light of the likely climate disaster that he and other Democrats believe will occur in their lifetimes. ""Youth represent a particularly vulnerable group because greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere will impact todays and tomorrows youth throughout their biological, psychological, academic, and social development,"" the resolution states. ""Youth are especially vulnerable to the physical and mental health impacts of climate-related disasters and the cumulative toll youth will endure from additional exposure to increasing climate-related disasters."" JOHN KERRY RUSHES TO DEFENSE OF CLIMATE ACTIVIST LEADERS WHO USE PRIVATE JETS Thompsons bill notes that a study from the American Public Health Association and ecoAmerica shows that nearly half of Americas youth has ""developed depression after a climate-related disaster."" Based on the expectation that these disasters will increase in number, Thompson says Congress must act to bolster the mental health of young Americans. His resolution calls for additional funding for climate education, ""resilience"" and other projects that ""benefit the mental health and well-being"" of young Americans. That includes the addition of ""trauma-informed approaches to mental health"" into disaster preparation efforts. He is also seeking more funding to school districts to help children cope with the ""mental health effects of continued climate-related disasters."" CCP-BACKED TECH COMPANIES ARE POISED TO CASH IN ON BIDEN'S CLIMATE BILL, NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS WARN Also this week, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., proposed her own resolution that calls for kids to be taught more about climate change at school. Lee said it would be a ""massive disservice not to teach students today about the threat of the climate crisisand to empower them with the education and tools they need to fight it."" Her resolution argues that children must be educated about the causes and effects of climate change, as well as potential solutions. Lee also agreed with Thompson that more mental health care is needed for kids as they take on this enormous task. Her bill says Congress should encourage people who develop educational programs on climate change should also ""address climate-induced trauma, acknowledging the growing impact of climate change on youths mental health."" CCP-BACKED TECH COMPANIES ARE POISED TO CASH IN ON BIDEN'S CLIMATE BILL, NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS WARN Her legislation also argues that climate disasters ""threaten the physical and mental safety of students by keeping them out of school, damaging infrastructure, and exacerbating Adverse Childhood Experiences."" More than a dozen Democrats signed onto Lees resolution, including Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said that despite the doom-and-gloom scenarios about the future effects of climate change, children must be taught that this is not a guaranteed outcome.   ""The next generation of Americans are growing up in a world that feels like its been predetermined for them,"" he said.

Kamala Harris issues dire climate change warning in Africa: 'Existential threat to the entire planet',"Vice President Kamala Harris gave a stern warning about the ""existential threat"" of climate change while speaking with farmers in Africa. Harris, visiting Panuka Farm in Zambia on Saturday, thanked the farmers for a tour of their facilities and demonstrations of their work before turning the conversation to the climate. ""The impact of the climate crisis is unmistakable, and without any question in my mind, poses an existential threat to the entire planet,"" the vice president said. KAMALA HARRIS DECLINES TO COMMENT ON TRUMP INDICTMENT  THEN ZAMBIA'S PRESIDENT WEIGHS IN ""The relevance of the topic as a global priority, as it relates to this continent, also includes the fact that the continent of Africa and the nations of Africa really are some of the lowest emitters in terms of greenhouse gas emissions  but are paying some of the highest costs,"" Harris said. Harris is in Zambia as part of a week-long visit to the African continent.  Her visit to Panuka Farm is intended to bring attention to climate-resilient agriculture and food security amid unpredictable climate change. KAMALA HARRIS SET TO UNVEIL $1 BILLION PLAN IN GHANA TO PROMOTE WOMEN'S ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT ""So, when I think about the work that is happening here  the work you're doing here, Panuka  it is not only a model of innovation, and inspired by, as you said, what we must do to be clever. But it is also an example of work that should happen around the country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  around the world to do the same,"" Harris told the farmers. Harris also related food scarcity to issues in the West, such as the ongoing refugee crisis, stating that famine and food insecurity can cause groups to flee their homeland. ""And it's a simple point, which is if people don't have food to eat where they live, they are likely to leave that place and often move in large numbers to a place that may not speak the same language or hold the same customs or culture  which invariably might lead to conflict. So the connection between these issues is quite clear,"" the vice president concluded.

"Climate change blamed for more home runs in baseball: Warmer air, more dingers","Over 500 home runs in Major League Baseball since 2010 can be attributed to climate change, a new study that has attracted widespread media attention claims. The study claimed that the upward trend in home runs in professional baseball is owed in part to rising temperatures making air less dense and allowing baseballs to travel farther when hit. Scientists acknowledged, however, that there are other factors as well to account for the increased amount of home runs in baseball. It predicted that rising temperatures could end up accounting for 10% of all home runs that will occur this century, provided climate change solutions arent implemented. JOE MANCHIN BLASTS BIDEN ADMIN FOR CEDING CONTROL TO CCP ON GREEN ENERGY: 'PATHETIC' The Dartmouth study, which was published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society on Friday, sought an answer to why the last 13 years have seen an upswing in the number of homers. According to the numbers, the time period has seen hundreds of more home runs compared to its preceding decade. Chris Callahan, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in climate modeling and impacts at Dartmouth College and avid baseball fan, told CNN that ""strong"" evidence showing climate change affecting batting distances ""surprised"" him. Callahan stated, ""I remember being surprised at how strong the finding was. Were not saying that every home run now is because of climate change, but you take the data and slice it any way you want, you find the same thing."" He added, ""And as a fan, I indeed am a little bit frustrated that home runs may continue to dominate, as it does now."" The study claimed that due to warmer temperatures making air less dense, balls were able to carry farther in the air and thus more likely to leave the yard. BREWERS OUTFIELDER SAYS 'USUALLY SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS' IN WIFE'S ABSENCE AFTER HITTING WALK-OFF RUN The studys co-author, Dartmouth assistant professor of geography Justin Mankin, corroborated the science behind the phenomenon, saying, ""Passenger jets fly at 30,000 feet, because air density is really low up there, and it just means that planes are more efficient, given the same fuel."" He added, ""We dont fly passenger jets low in the atmosphere because theres just so much more stuff in the way."" The studys methodology involved the researchers analyzing ""more than 100,000 MLB games and 220,000 individual hits"" and overlaying those numbers with data about ""unseasonably warm temperatures"" the CNN piece explained. They found a ""clear connection"" between home run numbers and rising temperatures.  The study found that ""games that were held in open stadiums during the day, when the sun is out, saw a spike in home runs, while games held at night or in domed stadiums would see a smaller number of home runs."" Their observations allowed them to propose that for every one degree Celsius increase in temperature, the number of home runs in a game goes up almost 2%.   The phenomenon would make it so that outdoor locations, like Chicago Cubs open-air Wrigley Field, would see a rise in home runs as the temperatures increased over time, whereas a domed stadium like Tropicana Field of the Tampa Bay Rays would not see a significant increase. Beyond inclement weather, climate change has been cited as a factor in a number of trends and societal ills, including hate speech, obesity rates, the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group and violent crime.",07/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/media/climate-change-blamed-more-home-runs-baseball-warmer-air-more-dingers
GOP urged to denounce ??larmist??UN climate change report,"EXCLUSIVE: A recent memo sent to every Republican member of Congress is urging lawmakers to dismiss the United Nations ""alarmist report"" on climate change. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently called on wealthy nations to move up its net-zero emissions goal from 2050 to 2040. But a memo sent by the Competitive Enterprise Institute offered Republicans talking points for refuting both the UNs findings and the Biden administrations push to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. ""In the wake of the latest alarmist report from the United Nations about emissions and climate change, I wanted to draw your attention to three new developments and realities that you should be aware of as debate about climate continues,"" the memo stated. WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO BOOST GREEN ENERGY IN COMMUNITIES REELING FROM COAL PLANT SHUTDOWNS The memo started by picking apart various claims from those who warn that global warming will lead to catastrophic changes to human and animal life. For example, it noted a short-term projection by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that suggests global temperatures peaked nearly a decade ago in 2015. ""Despite this reality, we are told every day that every emission warms the planet. That is clearly not the case. We should not mindlessly and recklessly proceed with dangerous and expensive emissions cuts until this paradox is resolved,"" the memo stated. It then pointed out that a recent report from the Energy Information Administration that said the Biden administration will already fall well short of its goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. BIDEN CONSIDERING CRACKING DOWN ON GAS CARS AFTER STRIPPING EVS OF TAX CREDITS ""Both the electricity utility industry and the Biden administration have now admitted that cutting net emissions to zero by 2050 ('net zero by 2050') are not happening,"" the memo outlined. Finally, the memo showed various doomsday predictions related to climate change going back to 1967 that never came true. ""These three points fairly question the wisdom of any rush to judgment on climate and/or the dismantling of our energy grid,"" the memo to lawmaker claimed. BIDEN ADMIN ISSUES 20-YEAR MINING BAN AS IT TURNS TO FOREIGN SUPPLY CHAIN AMID GREEN ENERGY PUSH House Republicans, armed with a new, narrow majority, are already chipping away at Biden's clean energy agenda. President Biden's $1.2 trillion Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, was hailed by supporters as the largest climate investment in history.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's group designed to fight climate change met for first time this week,"The group tasked by Gov. Josh Shapiro with developing a state-level plan to fight climate change met for the first time this week, a step the Democrat promised to take when he questioned his predecessor's strategy to make Pennsylvania the first major fossil fuel state to adopt carbon pricing. The group met Tuesday, unannounced, at a time when Shapiro is walking a tightrope between allies: those who support capping planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and labor unions whose members work on coal and natural gas sites. The group is chaired by Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, and Mike Dunleavy, a retired business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 5 in Pittsburgh. Shapiro's office declined to identify any other members of the group or discuss the instructions that the governor gave to the working group. Further, Shapiros office said the governor gave the working group no timeline to come up with recommendations, and is letting the group meet privately, without keeping public minutes of its meetings. Pressed for details about what, exactly, the working group is supposed to do, Shapiro's office pointed back to his criticism as a candidate of the centerpiece of then-Gov. Tom Wolfs plan to fight climate change. It could hurt the states energy industry, drive up electric prices and do little to curtail greenhouse gases, Shapiro has said. ""Governor Shapiro is focused on developing a comprehensive climate and energy policy that protects and creates energy jobs, takes real action to address climate change, protects consumers and ensures Pennsylvania has reliable, affordable, and clean power for the long term,"" Shapiro's office said. ""As he committed to doing while running for this office, the governor has convened a group of environmental, labor and business leaders to work together and recommend solutions that meet this test."" PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR: DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEY GENERAL JOSH SHAPIRO DEFEATS GOP CHALLENGER DOUG MASTRIANO Shapiro's most well-defined clean-energy goal is a pledge to ensure that Pennsylvania uses 30% of its electricity from renewable power sources by 2030, up from the current 8% in state law. However, that idea faces a steep climb in the Legislature, where the Republican-controlled Senate has been protective of hometown coal and natural gas industries in the nation's No. 2 gas state. For this part, Wolf went around the Legislature. To try to reduce greenhouse gases, Wolf used his regulatory authority to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a consortium of 12 states that imposes a price and declining cap on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Wolf called it a ""historic, proactive and progressive approach."" His administration estimated it would cut up to 225 million tons of carbon dioxide through 2030, compared to its estimate that Pennsylvania emitted 269 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2018. For now, Wolf's plan is on hold in court as judges consider legal challenges by Republican lawmakers and fossil-fuel interests. JOSH SHAPIRO BETS TOUGH MESSAGE ON CRIME, ECONOMY WILL OUTRUN RED WAVE IN PENNSYLVANIA Wolf's plan was supported by environmental advocates, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, and solar, wind and nuclear power producers. But it received sustained pushback from Republican lawmakers who accused Wolf of lacking the legal authority either to join the consortium and impose the fee without legislative approval. It was also opposed by coal- and gas-related interests that feared higher input costs, industrial and commercial power users that feared higher electricity bills and labor unions that feared its workers will lose jobs. Publicly, Shapiros administration has remained noncommittal about whether it will follow through on Wolfs carbon-pricing plan. Still, Shapiros acting environmental protection secretary, Rich Negrin, acknowledged during legislative hearings last month that Shapiro's administration will continue defending Wolfs plan in court. He called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ""a vehicle"" that could help meet Shapiros ""strong and very aspirational goals"" to help the environment.  Shapiros administration also raised eyebrows by writing $663 million into its budget plan for next year from the credits that must be bought by polluting power plants under the multistate consortium. Wolf had proposed using money from pollution credits for environmental improvements and energy efficiency programs to lower electricity bills. Pressed in a hearing to explain the effect of Wolf's plan on everyday electric ratepayers, Negrin put the onus on the working group. ""I think every single one of those questions is a good, strong, valid question that needs to be answered by the working group,"" Negrin said. ""And I think thats exactly what theyre talking about.""",14/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-gov-josh-shapiros-group-designed-fight-climate-change-meets-first-time-week
"Climate change, disease, habitat loss killing bats across North America, according to scientists","More than half of North America's bat species are likely to diminish significantly as climate change, disease and habitat loss take their toll, scientists warned Monday. A report by experts from the U.S., Canada and Mexico said 81 of the continent's 154 known bat types ""are at risk of severe population decline"" in the next 15 years. The ""state of the bats"" report was published by the North American Bat Conservation Alliance, a consortium of government agencies and private organizations. ""They need our help to survive,"" said Winifred Frick, chief scientist at Bat Conservation International, one of the participating groups. ""We face a biodiversity crisis globally and bats play a very important role in healthy ecosystems needed to protect our planet."" Bats give U.S. agriculture a $3.7 billion annual boost by gobbling crop-destroying insects, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Some are plant pollinators. Bats also serve as prey for other animals, including hawks, owls and weasels. Millions have died since 2006 from a fungal disease called white-nose syndrome, which attacks bats when hibernating and creates fuzzy spots on their muzzles and wings. It causes them to wake early from hibernation and sometimes fly outside. They can burn up winter fat stores and eventually starve. Eight U.S. bat species are listed as endangered, or on the brink of extinction. HUNDREDS OF BATS UNDERNEATH HOUSTON BRIDGE LOSE GRIP, PLUNGE TO GROUND AMID FREEZING TEMPERATURES The federal Fish and Wildlife Service designated the northern long-eared bat as endangered last year and has proposed listing for the tricolored bat. The little brown bat is being evaluated for potential listing. White-nose syndrome is the primary killer for each of the species. More than 150 agencies, nonprofits and universities are collaborating in the fight against the disease, said Jeremy Coleman, a wildlife biologist who coordinates the service's participation and a co-author of the report. Among methods under development are vaccines, anti-fungal sprays and ultraviolet light treatments for hibernation spots. ""We have a number of tools that are showing great promise,"" Coleman said. ""There are very few precedents for managing a wildlife disease, particularly one so devastating and pervasive."" The report said the bats also are imperiled by forest fragmentation  logging and urban sprawl in Canada, wildfire suppression in the U.S. and livestock ranching in Mexico. Many bats live in older trees during summer. People sometimes disturb hibernating bats in winter by exploring caves and abandoned mines. Climate change is expected to intensify the challenges, causing more extreme storms and temperature swings. The report said 82% of the continent's species are at risk from global warming's effects. CDC SCIENTISTS SPEARHEAD PROJECT TO TRACK MARBURG VIRUS ON BATS More than 1,500 bats were rescued in December after going into hypothermic shock during a sudden freeze in Houston, where they lost their grip and fell from roosting spots beneath bridges. Drought and increasingly arid conditions will leave bats with less drinking water, killing some and preventing others from reproducing, the report said. As surface waters dry up, there are fewer places to fly over in search of aquatic insects. Ironically, wind turbines  a leading source of renewable energy that can help slow climate change  pose another problem for bats. An estimated 500,000, representing 45 species, die each year in collisions with the structures, the report said. But those figures were based on 2021 calculations, said Frick, an associate research professor in ecology at the University of California at Santa Cruz in addition to her position with Bat Conservation International. So many turbines have been constructed since then that the latest estimate is 880,000 deaths.   Her organization is collaborating with manufacturers and others in searching for solutions, including acoustic devices that would cause bats to steer clear of turbines. Reducing blade rotation speeds  particularly during fall mating season, when bats are particularly active  would help, Frick said. Cori Lausen, director of bat conservation with Wildlife Conservation Society Canada, who did not participate in compiling the report, said it provided a solid overview of North American bats' plight. But some types it described as ""apparently secure"" based on their current status have grim prospects, she said. ""The government process is a slow one, deciding when to list a species and when not to. If anything, this report is a little conservative,"" Lausen said. ""Many of these bats should not be listed as OK.""",17/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/us/climate-change-disease-habitat-loss-killing-bats-across-north-america-according-scientists
"US invests $80M in alternative solar tech, more solar for renters","The Biden administration announced more than $80 million in funding Thursday in a push to produce more solar panels in the U.S., make solar energy available to more people, and pursue superior alternatives to the ubiquitous sparkly panels made with silicon. The Department of Energy announced the investments in the morning and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm plans to visit a community solar site in Washington in the afternoon. Community solar refers to a variety of arrangements where renters and people who don't control their rooftops can still get their electricity from solar power. Two weeks ago, Vice President Kamala Harris announced what the administration said was the largest community solar effort ever in the United States. Now it is set to spend $52 million on 19 solar projects across a dozen states, including $10 million from the infrastructure law, as well as $30 million on technologies that will help integrate solar electricity into the grid. The DOE also selected 25 teams to participate in a $10 million competition designed to fast-track the efforts of solar developers working on community solar projects. The Inflation Reduction Act already offers incentives to build large solar generation projects, such as renewable energy tax credits. But Ali Zaidi, White House national climate advisor, said the new money focuses on meeting the nation's climate goals in a way that benefits more communities. DO SOLAR PANELS ALWAYS SAVE ON ENERGY BILLS? ""Its lifting up our workers and our communities. And thats, I think, what really excites us about this work,"" Zaidi said. ""It's a chance not just to tackle the climate crisis, but to bring economic opportunity to every zip code of America."" The investments will help people save on their electricity bills and make the electricity grid more reliable, secure, and resilient in the face of a changing climate, said Becca Jones-Albertus, director of the energy departments Solar Energy Technologies Office. Jones-Albertus said she's particularly excited about the support for community solar projects, since half of Americans don't live in a situation where they can buy their own solar and put in on the roof. Michael Jung, executive director of the ICF Climate Center agreed. ""Community solar can help address equity concerns, as most current rooftop solar panels benefit owners of single-family homes,"" he said. In typical community solar projects, households can invest in or subscribe to part of a larger solar array offsite. ""What were doing here is trying to unlock the community solar market,"" Jones-Albertus said. The U.S. has 5.3 gigawatts of installed community solar capacity currently, according to the latest estimates. The goal is that by 2025, five million households will have access to it  about three times as many as today  saving $1 billion on their electricity bills, according to Jones-Albertus. The new funding also highlights investment in a next generation of solar technologies, intended to wring more electricity out of the same amount of solar panels. Currently only about 20% of the sun's energy is converted to electricity in crystalline silicon solar cells, which is what most solar panels are made of. There has long been hope for higher efficiency, and today's announcement puts some money towards developing two alternatives: perovskite and cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells. Zaidi said this will allow the U.S. to be ""the innovation engine that tackles the climate crisis."" Joshua Rhodes, a scientist at the University of Texas at Austin said the investment in perovskites is good news. They can be produced more cheaply than silicon and are far more tolerant of defects, he said. They can also be built into textured and curved surfaces, which opens up more applications for their use than traditional rigid panels. Most silicon is produced in China and Russia, Rhodes pointed out. Cadmium telluride solar can be made quickly and at a low cost, but further research is needed to improve how efficient the material is at converting sunlight to electrons. Cadmium is also toxic and people shouldn't be exposed to it. Jones-Albertus said that in cadmium telluride solar technology, the compound is stable and encapsulated in glass and additional protective layers.  The new funds will also help recycle solar panels and reuse rare earth elements and materials. ""One of the most important ways we can make sure CdTe remains in a safe compound form is ensuring that all solar panels made in the U.S. can be reused or recycled at the end of their life cycle,"" Jones-Albertus explained. Recycling solar panels also reduces the waste from solar and can provide materials for new panels. Eight of the projects in Thursday's announcement focus on improving solar panel recycling, for a total of about $10 million. Clean energy is a fit for every state in the country, the administration said. One solar project in Shungnak, Alaska was able to eliminate the need to keep making electricity by burning diesel fuel, a method sometimes used in remote communities that is not healthy for people and contributes to climate change. ""Alaska is not a place that folks often think of when they think about solar, but this energy can be an economic and affordable resource in all parts of the country,"" said Jones-Albertus.",20/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-invests-80m-alternative-solar-tech-more-solar-renters
Biden pledges $1B more in US funding for UN's Green Climate Fund,"President Biden is giving $1 billion to the United Nations' Green Climate Fund.

"AOC, other Dems reintroduce trillion-dollar Green New Deal that would end fossil fuels","A group of Democratic lawmakers reintroduced the Green New Deal, sweeping legislation that would cost taxpayers tens of trillions of dollars and phase out fossil fuel production. The Democrats  led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.  said their legislation, if enacted, would ""tackle the climate crisis"" with a decade-long mobilization that creates millions of good-paying, union jobs. They added the bill would strengthen U.S. infrastructure and combat pollution. ""When we first introduced the Green New Deal, we were told that our vision for the future was too aspirational,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Four years later, we see core tenets of the Green New Deal reflected in the Inflation Reduction Act  the largest ever federal investment in fighting climate change, with a focus on creating good, green jobs.""  ""But there is still much, much more to do to make environmental justice the center of U.S. climate policy,"" she continued. ""Todays reintroduction marks the beginning of that process  of strengthening and broadening our coalition, and of laying the policy groundwork for the next fight."" DEM CONGRESSWOMAN SILENT ON WHY SHE SIGNED HUSH AGREEMENT INVOLVING CHINESE TECH COMPANY Ocasio-Cortez and Markey, meanwhile, first introduced the Green New Deal resolution in February 2019 amid calls from climate activists and environmental organizations for Congress to pass aggressive policies curbing carbon emissions. The bill has been backed by a wide range of left-wing environmental and labor groups in addition to other Democrats. While the Green New Deal is just 14 pages and includes little detail about how it would achieve its lofty greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, the legislation would effectively end fossil fuel extraction and include massive investments in green energy alternatives. CONGRESS GEARS UP TO SMACK DOWN PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CHINESE SOLAR HANDOUT An analysis released by the American Action Forum shortly after the resolution was first introduced estimated that its provisions would cost up to $92.9 trillion.  ""In the four years since we first introduced the Green New Deal, the tides of our movement have risen and lifted climate action to the top of the national agenda,"" Markey said in a statement. ""We have demonstrated that our movement is a potent political force, and in the run-up to the 2024 elections, we will direct this power to demanding solutions to the intersectional crises Congress has yet to address: in health care, child care, schools, housing, transit, labor, and economic and racial justice,"" the Massachusetts lawmaker continued.  Overall, the Green New Deal calls for the U.S. to produce 100% of its power using zero-emissions sources, invest in electric vehicle development and upgrade infrastructure to achieve ""maximum energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification.""

"German climate advocates march through Berlin, cause gridlock in parts of the capital","German climate activists best known for bringing traffic to a standstill by gluing themselves to the road instead staged a rare protest on the move Friday, marching through Berlin and causing gridlock in parts of the capital. Members of the group Last Generation have repeatedly blocked roads across Germany in the past year in an effort to pressure the government to take more drastic action against climate change. On several occasions, they have glued themselves to the roads, enraging some motorists and prompting accusations of extremism from conservative politicians. Friday's protest saw hundreds of activists gather at a major road in the east of Berlin, then march very slowly toward the center, singing along the way. Police tried to get protesters to move off the road but later agreed to let the march continue along a set route. GERMANY SHUTTING DOWN LAST 3 NUCLEAR PLANTS, RELYING ON COAL, NATURAL GAS DURING 'CLEAN' ENERGY PUSH The group said earlier this week that its members would step up their actions in the coming days and try to ""peacefully bring the city to a standstill.""

"Top officials warned Biden admin about dangers wind energy projects pose to fishing industry, letter shows","The executive directors of three federally established fishery councils along the East Coast expressed concern last year about the threats posed by offshore wind energy projects. In an Aug. 22 letter to former Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Director Amanda Lefton, the three officials  who respectively lead the New England, Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils  expressed concern about current processes for approving offshore wind development. They also made a series of recommendations to help the federal government mitigate impacts on fisheries. ""As we have stated in several past comment letters to BOEM, we are very concerned about the cumulative impacts of multiple wind energy projects on the fisheries we manage,"" they stated in the letter. ""The multiple wind energy projects planned along the east coast will have cumulative and compounding effects on our fisheries.""  ""The synergistic effects of multiple projects may be more than additive and this may not be sufficiently identified in project-specific documents; therefore, losses may be undercompensated by taking a project-by-project approach,"" they continued. BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY PLANS POSE NATIONAL SECURITY RISK, PENTAGON WARNS In addition, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which represents the region encompassing the entire West Coast, penned its own letter to Lefton, similarly warning about the impacts of offshore wind development on fisheries.  The council said every proposed offshore wind lease area with multiple projects could negatively impact the ecology of the marine ecosystem, the fisheries the council manages and local fishing-dependent communities. The letters from the regional councils  which Congress established in 1976 to manage the nations marine fishery resources  came after BOEM proposed guidance in June to ensure offshore renewable energy development ""occurs in a thoughtful manner"" and that its conflicts with fisheries are minimized. Lefton said at the time the agency was seeking ""open and honest conversations focused on finding solutions."" BIDEN ADMIN SCIENTIST RAISED ALARM ON OFFSHORE WIND HARMING WHALES MONTHS AGO BOEM is expected to finalize the guidance in the coming weeks. The draft guidance, though, was criticized by the regional fishery management councils and a series of fishing industry groups that said it fell short. ""We recognize the need for renewable energy and the role these energy sources will play as we work to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. However, addressing climate change should not require significant negative impacts to food producers or to our ocean environment,"" Seafood Harvesters of America, a national organization representing thousands of fishermen nationwide, wrote in a letter to Lefton. ""We remain deeply concerned that these guidelines are simply recommendations and hold no promise of any actual mitigation or compensation for the fishing industry,"" they continued. ""Any potential effectiveness of these guidelines is negated by the fact that they are only suggestions for offshore wind energy developers, rather than binding requirements."" BLUE-COLLAR LOBSTERMEN SUE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP FOR DEFAMATION: 'THE HARM IS INTENTIONAL' In a separate letter, U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy Chief Counsel Major Clark said his department had heard concerns from heard from ""small commercial fishermen, port operators, marine equipment retailers, onshore processors, fish markets, and other fishing industry representatives."" ""Small businesses renewed their concerns regarding their inability to adequately comment on mitigation measures without knowing the impacts that offshore wind development activities will have,"" Clark wrote. ""There are simply too many unknowns for the current guidance to be effective."" Meanwhile, offshore wind projects have also faced increasing scrutiny in light of a recent spate of whales beaching along the East Coast. Since the beginning of the year, more than 20 humpback whales and endangered North Atlantic right whales have been discovered dead along the East Coast with most beaching in New Jersey, New York and Virginia, according to federal data. The uptick in deaths has led to calls from lawmakers, local officials and conservation organizations for a federal moratorium on wind development in the Atlantic Ocean.  While administration officials and some environmental groups have said there is no evidence suggesting wind turbine construction is killing whales and that the deaths are part of an ""unusual mortality event"" for both whale species dating back years, the region is on pace to far surpass death figures set since the mortality events were declared.

Soros' radical agenda: Here's how far his power and influence extend,"Billionaire left-wing philanthropist George Soros has been back in the news lately.  This time it pertains to questions about the 92-year-old Democrat mega-donors connection to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.  In the wake of Braggs openly political indictment of former President Donald Trump, Soros has been scrutinized for a $1 million contribution he made to a group that spent significant resources in support of Braggs candidacy.  While Soros didnt donate to Democrat Braggs campaign directly, tweets and statements in defense of his actions have raised eyebrows and rekindled a debate thats been on everyones mind in the political world for a very long time. How much sway does Soros have with Democrats at all levels of government?  For the past two decades, Soros has been an extremely influential benefactor of liberal candidates and causes. But these days, questions about his true reach extend far beyond the man himself to organizations and family members that push the same radical agenda.  GEORGE SOROS CIRCLES BACK TO VIRGINIA TO AID FAR-LEFT PROSECUTORS FACING DEM CHALLENGERS, FILINGS SHOW When Soros tweeted, ""While I didnt contribute to Alvin Braggs campaign, I have supported many other reform-minded prosecutors...,"" it struck many as disingenuous because his son and daughter-in-law both contributed over $10,000 each to Braggs campaign directly.  So, when Soros spokesperson added, ""George Soros and Alvin Bragg have never met in person or spoken by telephone, email, Zoom, etc... There has been no contact between the two,"" questions should have been asked about whether Bragg or Braggs staff had any contacts with any Soros family members or representatives of any of the advocacy groups under their control.  Once again, the uncurious mainstream media failed to drill down in search of the whole truth, perhaps intentionally.   According to the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations website, ""George Soros... has given over $32 billion to fund the Open Society Foundations, which work in over 120 countries around the world."" Even by todays standards, that is extraordinary largesse.  In calendar year 2021 alone, Open Society Foundations spent $401 million on programs in the United States, and its noteworthy that the groups U.S. activity has skyrocketed in recent years. In 2016 by contrast, the group ""only"" spent $162 million in America.  GEORGE SOROS' SON'S TRIPS TO BIDEN WHITE HOUSE WITH WAR CHEST COULD CAUSE DOUBLE THE DAMAGE So, on the charitable side, evidence suggests that the Soros influence over U.S. public policy is on the rise. On the political side, similar trends are apparent. A recent Washington Post article entitled, ""Meet the mega-donors pumping millions into the 2022 midterms,"" ranked Soros number one on the list with $128.5 million in contributions in support of Democrat candidates.  Soros massive financial support for left-wing candidates has opened doors in Washington at the highest levels of government. According to the New York Post, Alexander Soros ""scored at least a dozen meetings with White House officials in 2022, according to recently updated White House visitor logs."" Additionally, Tom Perriello, the executive director of an arm of Open Society Foundations, also visited the Biden White House multiple times in recent years. When it comes to Biden policy and Soros policy, its tough to tell where one ends and the other begins.  According to Open Society Foundations website, on the issue of voting rights, ""politics in the United States have been marked by partisan assaults on voting rights.""  SOROS-BACKED POLICY GROUP NOTCHES VICTORY WITH BIDEN'S TRANSGENDER TITLE IX RULES On immigration, the group says they ""support a range of groups that work on immigration issues, from local and state organizations that provide frontline legal advice, to individuals seeking asylum or facing deportation.""  On criminal justice reform, Open Society Foundations ""advocate for an approach to policing that emphasizes community engagement and accountability, particularly for the use of force.""  And on climate issues, Soros recently tweeted, ""Climate change is an existential threat to our civilization.""  If any of these statements were attributed to Joe Biden instead of someone in Soros world, no one would blink.    The problem with these positions is that they are both failed and dishonest. Turnout statistics indicate that Bidens divisive attacks on voter suppression are a total farce; the Biden administrations lawless immigration policy has created a war zone and fentanyl epidemic at the border; the lefts drive to ""reimagine policing"" has caused crime and the feeling of danger to skyrocket in our cities; and the irresponsible push for wasteful spending on the green new deal agenda has caused an inflation crisis that wont go away. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In addition, the Soros pet project of bankrolling the campaigns of left-wing district attorneys and local prosecutors around the country has been extremely detrimental to the American ideal of law and order. Unsurprisingly, Soros is in complete denial. In fact, if an op-ed he penned on the subject is any indication, he may be more out of touch than President Biden himself.  Soros opined that ""reform-minded prosecutors and other law-enforcement officials around the country have been coalescing around an agenda that promises to be more effective and just."" It takes just a cursory look at whats going on in Chicago and so many other cities to realize that nothing could be further from the truth.  But Soros continued his tall tale by saying, ""the funds I provide enable sensible reform-minded candidates to receive a hearing from the public. Judging by the results, the public likes what its hearing. ""This is absurd. Poll after poll say that Americans are very concerned about the rise in crime.   And perhaps most alarmingly, the tone-deaf Soros has indicated hes planning to continue his assault on safe streets in the future. He boasted in the article that he has ""no intention of stopping"" his support of radical prosecutors like Kimberly Gardner in St. Louis, Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, and Kim Foxx in Chicago. If theres a silver lining in the case of Alvin Braggs sham indictment of Donald Trump, maybe it will be the country refocusing on the failed radical agenda of George Soros, his family and their deep-pocketed organizations that are driving the Democrat Partys dangerous lurch to the left in the areas of crime, illegal immigration, and climate change.

Harris announces over $550 million in recommended funding to 'make communities resilient to climate impacts',"Vice President Kamala Harris said Friday the Department of Commerce has recommended $562 million in funding for projects that help make communities ""resilient"" to climate change impacts. Harris was scheduled to make a formal announcement about the investment at an event Friday evening in Miami. The awards were formed under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate-Ready Coasts Initiative, which is funded by both the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a Department of Commerce release said.  Included in the $562 million funding is $477 million for ""projects strengthening coastal communities ability to respond to extreme weather events, pollution, and marine debris; restoring coastal habitats to help wildlife and humans thrive; building the capacity of underserved communities to address climate hazards and supporting community-driven restoration; and creating jobs in local communities,"" according to the release. JEAN-PIERRE CLAIMS MCCARTHY ENERGY PLAN WOULD GIVE KIDS ASTHMA Another $46 million will go to the NOAA National Fish and Wildlife Foundation National Coastal Resilience Fund partnership, which helps communities prepare for an increase in coastal flooding, sea-level rises, and intense storms. In addition, $39.1 million will go towards ""34 state and territorial coastal zone management programs and 30 national estuarine research reserves that work in partnership with NOAA under the Coastal Zone Management Act,"" the DOC release said. BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REQUIRE AGENCIES TO MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PART OF MISSION Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said that the Biden-Harris administration is ""moving aggressively"" to ""tackle the climate crisis.""

California researchers working on new ocean-based climate solution,"Atop a 100-foot barge tied up at the Port of Los Angeles, engineers have built a kind of floating laboratory to answer a simple question: Is there a way to cleanse seawater of carbon dioxide and then return it to the ocean so it can suck more of the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere to slow global warming? Called the lungs of the planet, the ocean, whose plants and currents take in carbon dioxide, has already helped the Earth tremendously by absorbing 30 percent of carbon dioxide emissions since the Industrial Revolution and capturing 90 percent of the excess heat from those emissions. Acting as a giant carbon sink, it has been a crucial buffer in protecting people from even worse effects of early climate change. Seawater can store 150 times more carbon dioxide per unit volume than air, roughly. But absorbing the greenhouse gas has come at a cost, causing oceans to become more acidic, destroying coral reefs and harming marine species, including impeding shellfish from building their skeletons. The technology, dubbed SeaChange, developed by the University of California Los Angeles engineering faculty, is meant to seize on the ocean's natural abilities, said Gaurav Sant, director of UCLAs Institute for Carbon Management. The process sends an electrical charge through seawater flowing through tanks on the barge. That then sets off a series of chemical reactions that trap the greenhouse gas into a solid mineral that includes calcium carbonate  the same thing seashells are made of. The seawater is then returned to the ocean and can pull more carbon dioxide out of the air. The calcium carbonate settles to the sea floor. 2 MEN IN CALIFORNIA WRONGLY CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER DECLARED INNOCENT AFTER 17 YEARS IN PRISON Plans are now underway to scale up the idea with another demonstration site starting this month in Singapore. Data collected there and at the Port of Los Angeles will help in the design of larger test plants. Those facilities are expected to be running by 2025 and be able to remove thousands of tons of CO2 per year. If they are successful, the plan is to build commercial facilities to remove millions of tons of carbon annually, Sant said. But even if the project is able to remove millions of tons, that is still thousands of times less than what will be needed to meaningfully address climate change. ""Im not saying this wont work, but the ultimate thing is how much CO2 will it actually draw down on a scale of decades?"" said Margaret Leinen, director of Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Sant doesnt disagree. Scientists estimate at least 10 billion metric tons of carbon will need to be removed from the air annually beginning in 2050, and the pace will need to continue over the next century. ""That really is the fundamental metric that youve got to keep in mind,"" he said. Thats why the success of any of the technologies will rely on ""how fast you can build them out,"" he added. According to the UCLA team, at least 1,800 industrial-scale facilities would be needed to capture 10 billion tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year, but fewer could still make a dent. The project is among a host of ideas being explored by scientists who warn that cutting emissions will not be enough to limit global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit and avert catastrophic changes to ecosystems. Much of the attention until recently has been on land-based initiatives such as planting trees or building factories to capture carbon from emitters, but they have limitations including costs and how much land they would cover. So scientists have increasingly turned to help from the ocean, which covers 70 percent of the Earths surface. Among the ideas researchers are looking at is fertilizing the surface of the ocean to cause a proliferation of tiny carbon-absorbing phytoplankton. Another would sprinkle beaches with minerals that could be slowly swept in with the tides or deposited on coast beds to increase seawaters alkalinity so it can pull more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. CALIFORNIA TO MEET 100% WATER REQUESTS AFTER WINTER STORMS SEND RECORD SNOWPACK, REGULATORS SAY None of the projects have been tested on a global scale, and there is concern about tampering with the ocean. Aleck Wang, a marine carbon chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said with the number of ocean-based carbon dioxide removal research projects ""booming,"" there will likely not be one single solution. ""I think we need all of the methods, at least somewhat, so that we can really get to the target, which is the removal of a huge amount of carbon,"" he said. Researchers from the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering built the demonstration system in two years. One thing that distinguishes the process is that it produces hydrogen. To remove a metric ton of carbon dioxide, about 220 metric tons of water needs to flow through the system. That produces 35 kilograms of hydrogen, Sant said. Sant founded the Los Angeles-based startup Equatic to scale up the project. It would generate revenue from selling the hydrogen, as well as carbon credits that companies, like those in the airline industry, can claim to balance out their pollution, he said. The aim is to remove the carbon at a cost well below $100 a metric ton. The hydrogen would be produced at less than $1 per kilogram, which would be substantially less than the current cost of cleanly-produced hydrogen. CALIFORNIA DRIVER ACCUSED OF INTENTIONALLY RUNNING DOWN TEENS The project has received tens of millions of dollars from supporters including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the U.S. Department of Energy. Andres Clarens, an engineering professor at the University of Virginia who researches carbon dioxide removal, said it is a plus that the process produces hydrogen, but hes concerned that it would require a lot of energy to make a difference. He also asks: ""What does it mean for people that use the water already for fishing and for you know, other forms of production? What does it mean for those ecosystems?"" Sant has said a filtration system bars marine life from being sucked in with the seawater. He called the energy required ""minimal."" The system uses about two megawatt hours of energy per ton of carbon dioxide removed but its co-product, hydrogen, produces one megawatt hour of energy. Hydrogen could be used to help power the systems or be sold to be used as a green fuel for industries, Sant said. ""The approach is based on the idea that you want to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide accumulations,"" Sant said.  With any of these efforts, the risks must be weighed carefully to ensure the efforts to limit climate change are truly effective and do not cause greater harm to the planet in the process, scientists say. Clarens of the University of Virginia said the sea may be where such solutions can be found. ""The ocean is an important sort of untapped place and thats why Im very curious to see if they can get this to work,"" he said.",21/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-researchers-working-new-ocean-based-climate-solution
"Kerry says US, China must work together on climate, world 'not doing enough'","Ahead of Earth Day, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry asserted Friday that the U.S. and China must work together in order to combat the global climate crisis.  ""Theres no way that any one country can solve this crisis,"" he told MSNBC, ""and, particularly, if we are large emitting nations.""  ""So it is imperative that China and the United States find a way to cooperate with respect to the climate crisis.""  The former secretary of state said while President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping had agreed to ""keep the climate issue separate,"" recent tensions regarding the issue of Taiwan have thrown a wrench in discussions.  BIDEN PLEDGES $1B MORE IN US FUNDING FOR UN'S GREEN CLIMATE FUND ""My hope is, because its imperative for the planet, that China ... [helps] work with the United States. And its not a question of the U.S. giving away something. Its a question of all of us getting something together,"" he said, stressing the need to reduce emissions.  ""Everybody understands that in the world  that the emissions are the problem. It's the way we burn our fuel. It's the way we heat our homes. It's the way we move our vehicles,"" Kerry added.  Kerry noted that Biden had hosted the 20 major economies of the world in discussing steps they had taken to further this universal push. ""It's just that we're not, all of us, doing enough, and we're not doing enough fast enough,"" he said. Kerry also addressed criticism over the administration's move to approve the controversial $8 billion-dollar Willow project in March. The massive drilling plan by oil giant ConocoPhillips could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day on Alaskas petroleum-rich North Slope. CALIFORNIA RESEARCHERS WORKING ON NEW OCEAN-BASED CLIMATE SOLUTION Andrea Mitchell asked Kerry whether such a move was an indication of a reversal of the pledge to move away from fossil fuels.  Kerry said the president had faced a situation where the company ""had a right to go ahead"" after legitimately purchasing leases 10 or more years ago. ""Now, what they're going to do was going to happen for some period of time  it just doesn't happen that fast,"" he said, adding that more electric vehicles will send the demand for gasoline and oil use plummeting.  ""What is in Willow is miniscule, compared to the overall demand challenge that we face,"" Kerry continued. "" And, the key here is to move faster in changing demand and changing supply and in bringing online the new technologies that can scale up and make the difference. That's how we win this battle.""  ""Were not going to say were not going to use gas and oil. Thats not reality, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland told the Society of Environmental Journalists on Friday. ""So we are doing the best we absolutely can.   Despite Biden's campaign promise to end new drilling on federal lands, she said the administration is ""following the science and the law"" and is ""not going to turn the faucet off and say were not drilling anymore. To prevent the worst of the future harms of climate change, the head of the United Nations recently called for an end to new fossil fuel exploration and for rich countries to quit using coal, oil and gas by 2040.

Biden admin is rushing to industrialize US oceans to stop climate change: 'Environmental wrecking ball',"The Biden administration is pushing full steam ahead to massively expand offshore wind development across millions of acres of federal waters, actions that critics warn would have dire ecological and economic impacts. Days after taking office, President Biden issued an executive action ordering his administration to expand opportunities for the offshore wind industry as part of his aggressive climate agenda to curb greenhouse gas emissions and stop global warming. Months later, he outlined goals to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, the most ambitious goal of its kind worldwide. ""Two years ago, President Biden issued a bold challenge to move America towards a clean energy future,"" Deb Haaland, the secretary of the Department of the Interior (DOI), said earlier this month. ""The Interior Department answered that call and is moving rapidly to create a robust and sustainable clean energy economy with good-paying union jobs."" In May 2021, the DOI's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) approved the 800-megawatt Vineyard Wind project 12 miles off the coast of Massachusetts, marking the first ever large-scale offshore wind approval. Then, in November 2021, the agency approved the 130-megawatt Southfork Wind project off the coast of Long Island, New York, the second commercial-scale offshore project. TOP OFFICIALS WARNED BIDEN ADMIN ABOUT DANGERS WIND ENERGY PROJECTS POSE TO FISHING INDUSTRY, LETTER SHOWS A number of other proposed offshore wind projects along the Atlantic coast are under development and in the federal permitting stage. The Biden administration has leased hundreds of thousands of acres to energy corporations and plans future lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of California. ""This is an environmental wrecking ball,"" David Stevenson, the president of the American Coalition for Ocean Protection (ACOP), told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""It's an economic disaster. From an environmental  from a climate change standpoint, it's also useless."" ""It is going to turn the oceans into an industrial park, particularly at night when you've got red flashing lights. It's going to look like the industrial area in northern New Jersey,"" added Stevenson, who founded ACOP to mount legal defenses in response to offshore wind development on behalf of local shoreline communities. BIDEN ADMIN SCIENTIST RAISED ALARM ON OFFSHORE WIND HARMING WHALES MONTHS AGO Stevenson and other opponents of large-scale offshore wind development have noted that BOEM has acknowledged the negative impacts of the proposals it has approved.  According to a report ACOP published in February, BOEM has stated that wind turbine structures will lead to radar interference, increasing likelihood of vessel collisions and complicating search-and-rescue missions; likely harm wildlife; industrialize ocean views, possibly harming tourism industries; impede key military operations; and impair oceanic scientific research. BOEM has admitted that the commercial fishing industry would shoulder millions of dollars in economic damages.  ""While Vineyard Wind is not authorized to prevent free access to the entire wind development area, due to the placement of the turbines it is likely that the entire 75,614 acre area will be abandoned by commercial fisheries due to difficulties with navigation,"" BOEM stated in its May 10, 2021, record of decision green-lighting the Vineyard Wind project, for example. ""The extent of impact to commercial fisheries and loss of economic income is estimated to total $14 million over the expected 30-year lifetime of the Project,"" it continued. In another example, BOEM's environmental impact analysis published last summer for Ocean Wind 1  a 1,100-megawatt project proposed off the southern New Jersey coast  the agency concluded that impacts on commercial fisheries, navigation and views would all be ""major."" BLUE-COLLAR LOBSTERMEN SUE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP FOR DEFAMATION: 'THE HARM IS INTENTIONAL' ""This is the industrialization of our oceans,"" Bonnie Brady, executive director of the Long Island Commercial Fishing Association, told Fox News Digital.  ""This is creating a construction zone, pile-driving a 4,000-kilojoule hammer that's about 30 to 40 feet wide, pounding giant steel, thousand-foot poles into the ocean floor and then jet-plowing, which is liquefying the ocean floor up to 10 or 12 feet, and laying giant 100,000-volt cables in the ocean floor and then turning on the switch and seeing what happens,"" she continued. ""I mean, that's a problem,"" Brady said. ""These are areas of extreme productivity for not just fish, but marine mammals."" Brady's Long Island Commercial Fishing Association is a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit led by the Rhode Island-based fishing company Seafreeze challenging the Biden administration's approval of Vineyard Wind. An attorney representing plaintiffs said the project was an example of the administration's ""stubborn pursuit of increasing renewable energy generation regardless of who it hurts."" According to Brady, the federal wind lease area off the shores of Massachusetts and Rhode Island is larger than Rhode Island, Long Island and much of the 1,902-square-mile Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. And offshore wind turbines are massive, nearly three times the height of the Statue of Liberty. DOZENS OF NJ MAYORS CALL FOR IMMEDIATE OFFSHORE WIND MORATORIUM AFTER LATEST WHALE DEATHS ""Imagine that we're all standing on that beautiful [Grand Canyon] vista and there's a turbine a mile apart in every single direction, a thousand feet tall,"" Brady said. ""There you go, that's your picture. And that's going to be the picture all up and down every single coastline."" Overall, the Biden administration's rapid development of offshore wind has faced resistance from environmental groups, fishing industry groups, federally-established fishery councils, small business organizations, local officials, lawmakers and, most recently, the Department of Defense. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., who represents New Jersey's southern coastline, including Atlantic City, has criticized the White House over the last several months for looking the other way at wildlife impacts of offshore wind projects. ""In Joe Bidens mad rush to a net zero energy economy, federal agencies responsible for the implementation of offshore wind have hastily pushed forward these projects with little regard to industries like fishing and maritime transports, ignored the concerns of coastal communities who rely on the ocean for jobs and tourism, ignored the national security concerns raised by our own military, and have been negligent in properly studying the harmful impacts these turbines will have on our environment,"" Van Drew told Fox News Digital. ""And despite these concerns and warnings from communities, stakeholders, and members of Congress, this administration pushes it aside with the sole excuse being that the industrialization of our oceans will save the planet by stopping climate change,"" he continued.  NJ CONGRESSMAN AIMS TO FORCE BIDEN ADMIN TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER WIND PROJECTS ARE KILLING WHALES Since the beginning of the year, more than 20 humpback whales and endangered North Atlantic right whales have been discovered dead along the East Coast, with most beaching in New Jersey, New York and Virginia, according to federal data. The uptick in whale deaths has led to calls from lawmakers, local officials and conservation organizations for a federal moratorium on wind development in the Atlantic Ocean. While administration officials and some environmental groups have said there is no evidence suggesting that wind turbine construction is killing whales and that the deaths are part of an ""unusual mortality event"" for both whale species dating back years, the region is on pace to far surpass death figures set since the mortality events were declared. ""The agencies admit it themselves in their environmental impact statements that offshore wind will increase impacts on climate change unless it completely replaces the fossil fuel industry,"" Van Drew said. ""Thats their goal  to make America completely reliant on an unreliable renewable energy source. And thats the crux of this situation.""  ""These industrial wind grids are money grabs for major corporations and legacy builders for politicians,"" he added. ""To replace fossil fuels, they will need to lease millions upon millions of acres of our oceans and lakes to generate the power we are already producing.""  ""Think about it: a wall of turbines lining our horizons for decades to come, generating more expensive energy for homes and businesses, killing sea life, destroying generational industries."" Van Drew noted that wind turbine technology is mainly manufactured overseas and that, over the long-term, offshore wind projects will create a few dozen permanent jobs. ""The warnings are clear, and our president and our government need to listen and act before it is too late.""",22/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-rushing-industrialize-us-oceans-stop-climate-change-environmental-wrecking-ball
"Biden administration expected to announce plan to protect forests from fire, other climate change side affects","Alert: US officials say old growth and mature forests on government lands cover an area larger than California, and the Biden administration plans a new rule to protect them. The Biden administration has identified more than 175,000 square miles of old growth and mature forests on U.S. government land and plans to craft a new rule to better protect the nation's woodlands from fires, insects and other side effects of climate change, federal officials planned to announce Thursday. Results from the government's first-ever national inventory of mature and old-growth forests on federal land were obtained by The Associated Press in advance of a public release. U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands combined have more than 50,000 square miles of old growth forests and about 125,000 square miles of mature forests, according to the inventory. That's more than half the forested land managed by the two agencies, and it covers an area larger than California. Yet officials say those stands of older trees are under increasing pressure as climate change worsens wildfires, drought, disease and insects  and leaves some forests devastated. BIDEN ORDER AIMS TO PROTECT OLD-GROWTH FORESTS AS WILDFIRES BLAZE AROUND US Older forests ""are struggling to keep up with the stresses of climate change,"" said USDA Under Secretary for Natural Resources and the Environment Homer Wilkes. ""We must adapt quickly."" Representatives of the timber industry and some members of Congress have been skeptical about President Joe Bidens ambitions to protect older forests, which the Democrat unveiled last year on Earth Day. They've urged the administration to instead concentrate on lessening wildfire dangers by thinning stands of trees where decades of fire suppression have allowed undergrowth to flourish, which can be a recipe for disaster when fires ignite. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore appeared this week before a U.S. Senate committee where he was pressured by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to speed up thinning work on federal forests. Moore faced pointed questioning from U.S. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a Republican who warned the administration's conservation efforts could ""lock Americans out of the public lands"" by putting areas off-limits to timber harvests and other uses. FOREST PROTECTION SUMMIT UNDERWAY IN GABON, SOME COUNTRIES BELIEVE PROTECTING FORESTS NEEDS TO BE PROFITABLE Most old growth forests in the Lower 48 states were logged during the past two centuries. Previous protections for older trees have come indirectly, such as the ""roadless rule"" adopted under former President Bill Clinton in 2001 that blocked logging on about a quarter of federal forests. ""Theres a significant amount of mature and old growth trees that are already under protected status,"" said Nick Smith with the American Forest Resource Council, a timber industry group. ""Were not calling for active management on environmentally-sensitive landscapes, but at least in areas where we can do thinning and wildfire mitigation fuels reduction. Federal land managers should already be doing that."" Administration officials announced Thursday they will be soliciting comments for a proposed rule that would ""adapt current policies to protect, conserve and manage national forests and grasslands for climate resilience."" A formal rulemaking notice was expected to be published in the federal register in coming days. Further details were not immediately released. Environmental groups had lobbied the administration to pursue new regulations for forests that would limit logging of older trees. Blaine Miller-McFeeley with Earthjustice said he expects some logging would continue under a new rule, but conservation and recreational uses also would be promoted. ""We are still logging old growth and mature forests here at home,"" Miller-McFeeley said. ""The focus has been largely on the number of board feet (harvested). It has not been focused on which trees are most scientifically smart to bring down for climate, for community protection from wildfires."" The age used to determine what counted as old growth varied widely by tree species  from 80 years for gambel oaks, to 300 years for bristlecone pines. Most of the old growth and mature forests are in western states such as Idaho, California, Montana and Oregon. But theyre also in New England, around the Great Lakes and in southern states such as Arkansas, Kentucky and West Virginia, according to an online map posted by the Forest Service. The most extensive old growth forests are dominated by pinyon and juniper trees and cover a combined 14,000 square miles, according to the inventory. The inventory excluded federal lands in Alaska where an old growth analysis was ongoing.  Experts say large trees can store significant volumes of carbon dioxide and keep the gas from warming the planet as it enters the atmosphere. Underlining the urgency of the issue are wildfires in California that killed thousands of giant sequoias in recent years. Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of the trees in 2021, adding to a two-year death toll of up to nearly a fifth of Earths largest trees. They are concentrated in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range. Global wildfires in 2021 emitted the equivalent of about 7.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. Thats equal to about 18% of global CO2 emissions from coal, oil and other energy sources recorded in 2021 by the International Energy Agency.",22/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/us/biden-administration-expected-announce-rule-protect-forests-fire-climate-change-side-affects
Climate czar John Kerry says extreme storms caused by climate change will 'rip' crops away and 'destroy homes',"Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry blamed the deaths of millions on climate change, adding that extreme weather events created by the phenomenon will result in farmers' crops being ripped away and their homes getting destroyed. During Sundays episode of ""Inside with Jen Psaki,"" on MSNBC, the former press secretary sat down with Kerry for a conversation about climate change. Psaki told Kerry that in an August poll conducted by NBC, voters ranked climate change as the fifth most important issue, behind things like the economy, immigration and the cost of living. PSAKI HAS DESSERT IN HARD-HITTING INTERVIEW WITH FORMER BOSS: DOESNT ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS EITHER' She then asked Kerry if he could make the case for climate change to be the most important issue, instead of the fifth most important issue. ""It is an existential issue,"" Kerry said. ""It is an issue where people today are dying."" The former Democratic candidate told Psaki 15 million people die every year because of bad air quality, and another 10 million people die because of extreme heat, as ""its getting hotter."" KERRY SAYS US, CHINA MUST WORK TOGETHER ON CLIMATE, WORLD NOT DOING ENOUGH Kerry also said there are going to be more intensive weather events that will cost the country ""an awful lot more money."" ""So, as that happens, as people see their farms, you know, their crops ripped away, or their homes destroyed, you watch the pressure grow,"" Kerry said. ""I believe were in a transformational moment. I think this will be one of, if not the, but it will be one of the top three issues in the 24 presidential election. No question in my mind."" Psaki and Kerry are no strangers, as she served as his spokesperson at the State Department during the Obama administration. JOHN KERRY RUSHES TO DEFENSE OF CLIMATE ACTIVIST LEADERS WHO USE PRIVATE JETS Last month, Kerry was interviewed by Yahoo News and took issue with criticism against leaders who fly on private jets despite lofty climate ambitions. He told Yahoo News those individuals are ""working harder"" than most to fight climate changes, and echoed an argument defending private jet travel he has previously used, suggesting so-called carbon offsets justify such high-carbon-footprint travel. ""They offset  they buy offsets, they offset, and they are working harder than most people I know to be able to try to effect this transition,"" he said. A carbon offset is a reduction of carbon emissions aimed at counteracting increased emissions elsewhere.   Despite defending his fellow world leaders, Kerry has opted against flying on private jets since assuming his current position at the State Department. He notably flew commercial to both United Nations climate summits that have taken place during his tenure as climate envoy.",23/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-czar-john-kerry-says-extreme-storms-climate-change-rip-crops-away-destroy-homes
"AOC admits 'massive' scale of Green New Deal, says climate change will be even worse","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., defended her reintroduction of the Green New Deal on Sunday, admitting the bill was ""massive,"" but saying the threat of climate change is even greater. Ocasio-Cortez made the comments during a Sunday interview with MSNBC host Jen Psaki. The divisive lawmaker introduced her Green New Deal for the second time last week, arguing that it is time to ""aggressively"" transform the American workforce. ""You just reintroduced the Green New Deal,"" Psaki began. ""When you talk about big, expensive new programs, that's where you sometimes hit resistance, I think. How do you convince those people, people who believe climate change is real, it is a crisis, but they're concerned that some of these proposed solutions are too grand?"" ""It is important to acknowledge that the scale and the scope of what we are proposing is massive, but the scale and the scope of the climate crisis is even bigger,"" Ocasio-Cortez responded. ""If we are not proactive about very aggressively and transformationally addressing our infrastructure, our workforce, our preparation for the climate crisis, then the costs of not addressing it are going to be far greater."" CONGRESS GEARS UP TO SMACK DOWN PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CHINESE SOLAR HANDOUT Ocasio-Cortez reintroduced her trillion-dollar Green New Deal last week, and analysts say it could end up costing the U.S. up to $92.9 trillion if passed.

""Four years later, we see core tenets of the Green New Deal reflected in the Inflation Reduction Act  the largest ever federal investment in fighting climate change, with a focus on creating good, green jobs."" ""But there is still much, much more to do to make environmental justice the center of U.S. climate policy,"" she continued. ""Todays reintroduction marks the beginning of that process  of strengthening and broadening our coalition, and of laying the policy groundwork for the next fight.""  While the Green New Deal is just 14 pages and includes little detail about how it would achieve its lofty greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, the legislation would effectively end fossil fuel extraction and include massive investments in green energy alternatives.

"Climate change protesters briefly delay Formula E race, leaving fans scratching their heads","Formula E is one of the greenest racing series in the world as the vehicles that the racers drive are fully electric, so it was curious when climate change protesters interrupted a race in Germany on Sunday. Several activists in white shirts climbed the fences at the Tempelhof venue in Berlin and sat in front of cars that were already off of the starting grid. Letzte Generation (Last Generation) posted a video of the protesters disrupting the start of the race. The protesters were whisked away from the track by security guards.

"Panel of Democrats, environmental activists blame climate change for whale deaths","Climate change, spurred by the burning of fossil fuels, is the biggest danger to marine life including whales, a panel of Democratic officials and environmental groups said Monday. The gathering, held in an oceanfront conference room as a half-dozen dolphins frolicked in the ocean behind them, also strongly criticized a bill in the House of Representatives containing numerous incentives for oil and gas companies, and which eliminates several environmental protections currently in effect. It also was a retort to opponents of offshore wind development, who claim that preparation for wind farms off New Jersey and New York are killing whales along the U.S. East Coast. Numerous federal and state agencies say there is no evidence that the deaths are related to offshore wind survey work. MYSTERY OVER WHALE DEATHS SPARKS ALARM: WE NEED TO 'PAUSE AND INVESTIGATE' The event came a week after U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. and other New Jersey Congressional Democrats wrote to the White House Council on Environmental Quality ""demanding real solutions in response to the death of marine mammals off New Jerseys coast."" But the letter did not seek pause in offshore wind projects as many Republicans demand. Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, two Republican Congressmen from New Jersey, want the work stopped at least temporarily. Neither responded to a request for comment Monday. No Republican elected officials were at Monday's event. Earlier this month, Republican New Jersey state senators Declan OScanlon and Ed Durr introduced a resolution calling on the federal and state governments to enact a moratorium on offshore wind preparation, saying ""We cannot ignore the surge in marine life deaths that has occurred while offshore wind project preparation activities have been conducted along the coast."" At Monday's event, Pallone said, ""The science has not linked the whale deaths to offshore wind activities. Climate change is the biggest threat to marine mammals."" Pallone and others said that as water temperatures rise, fish species that whales prey upon have been moving into different areas, bringing whales more frequently into the path of heavily traveled shipping lanes off the East Coast. Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey's environmental protection commissioner, said the migrating bait fish are ""bringing marine life into direct contact with the shipping superhighway that sits off our coast."" As Ed Potosnak of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters put it, ""They're having a picnic in the Parkway; they're getting hit."" Of the 32 whales that have died off the East Coast since Dec. 1, many have shown signs of being struck by ships or being entangled in discarded fishing gear, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month after a speech at Monmouth University, NOAA's administrator, Richard Spinrad, said ship strikes are a common cause of recent whale deaths. ""We study the fisheries, where the fish are, what the populations are, and there is some thought as to the whales following a change, a shift in where the prey is that the whales feed on, which may be a consequence of a change in the ocean itself,"" Spinrad said. ""By moving further inshore these whales are then more vulnerable to things like ship strikes. The science that we have conducted suggests there is not a link between the activities of offshore wind and the strandings we've seen along the East Coast."" U.S. Sen Cory Booker said burning fossil fuels ""is causing our house to be on fire, and we have been supplying the matches."" NOAA REPORT SAYS NEW JERSEY TURBINES MAY 'ADVERSELY AFFECT' WHALES, BUT DENIES LETHALITY Capt. Paul Eidman, of the group Anglers for Offshore Wind Power, said climate change is already affecting commercial and recreational fishing by changing where bait fish  and their predators  travel. ""Offshore wind energy offers a clean, economical, beneficial opportunity to combat the climate crisis and an alternative to continuing to burn fossil fuels,"" he said. ""We cannot ignore the fact that the impacts of climate change are disrupting species migration and holding patterns, posing serious risks to the long-term future of recreational fishing and the species we rely on."" Panelists sharply criticized HR1, a bill being pushed by House Republicans to lower energy costs by giving incentives to fossil fuel industries, rolling back many environmental laws and protections, and limiting the power of a president or government agency to limit or prevent energy projects on federal land.  The bill has been attached to legislation the Republicans support in return for increasing the nation's debt limit and avoiding a government financial default.",24/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/panel-democrats-environmental-activists-blame-climate-change-whale-deaths
Climate activists arrested after blocking rush-hour DC traffic,"A group of climate activists were arrested Monday morning after they blocked rush hour traffic in Washington, D.C., while demanding President Biden declare a ""climate emergency."" Six members of the climate activist group Declare Emergency were filmed sitting on a city crosswalk, preventing vehicles from moving forward and angering a series of commuters, according to video captured by the group and independent filmmaker Ford Fischer of the independent media outlet News2Share.  The activists held signs that stated ""Declare Emergency!"" and ""No Willow Project,"" a reference to an oil drilling project Biden approved in March. ""You guys don't have to go to work. Some people are possibly going to get fired because of you. What is your plan?"" one frustrated commuter said to the protesters. BIDEN ADMIN APPROVES MASSIVE GAS PIPELINE PROJECT IN HUGE BLOW TO CLIMATE ACTIVISTS ""To raise awareness to people like you. To help you get involved,"" an activist responded. ""Do you care about your kids?"" The protest, which lasted about 25 minutes, ultimately created a massive blockade of vehicles. As the protesters remained steadfast sitting on the ground, drivers continuously honked their horns. Eventually, several Metropolitan Police Department officers arrived, handcuffed the activists and detained them in a police van. MASSIVE OIL PROJECT SPARKED CIVIL WAR WITHIN BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, LAWMAKERS SAY ""Unfortunately, we need to do this,"" one of the protesters said as he was being arrested. ""We are only trying to get the attention of President Biden and of the media to raise this issue to the highest degree. It's dismal how much news is out there about the climate crisis. It is happening around the world right now."" While Biden has focused much of his presidency on combating climate change, he has yet to formally declare it a national emergency. A climate emergency declaration would enable Biden to bypass Congress and take a number of regulatory steps not normally authorized to the White House. In July, after reports that the president would issue such a declaration, he opted instead to issue executive orders addressing the ""climate crisis,"" but he stopped short of an emergency declaration.  ""This is an emergency  an emergency  and I will look at it that way,"" Biden remarked at an event announcing the actions. ""I said last week, I'll say it again, loud and clear. As president, I'll use my executive powers to combat climate change, the climate crisis, in the absence of congressional action."" The president has also been criticized recently for actions such as approving the Willow Project and green-lighting a massive natural gas export project, both of which are located in Alaska.",24/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-activists-arrested-blocking-rush-hour-dc-traffic
White House furiously consulting eco groups ahead of expected power plant crackdown,"Biden administration officials have consulted a number of left-wing environmental groups as they craft a rule forcing fossil fuel-fired power plants to substantially curb emissions. Over the last two weeks, senior White House and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials have met with the organizations  including Climate Action Campaign, Union of Concerned Scientists, Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Clean Air Task Force and Evergreen Action  to discuss a highly-anticipated plan to tackle power plant emissions, according to federal filings. ""Among all of those groups, there aren't really any energy experts or electric grid experts or scientists. It's activists who use environmental issues to advance the Democrat agenda,"" Daniel Turner, the executive director of Power The Future, told Fox News Digital. ""So, it's totally unsurprising that these are the ones calling the shots."" ""It shows who's really pulling the strings at the Biden White House,"" he continued. BIDEN ADMIN PREPARING MAJOR CRACKDOWN ON POWER PLANTS THAT FUEL NATION'S GRID The most recent of the meetings, meanwhile, came Monday afternoon with leaders of the Climate Action Campaign which advocates for federal policies that would replace the current U.S. power grid with one fueled only by green energy sources like wind and solar. The group's website argues that transitioning to a 100% green energy-powered grid is crucial for ""ensuring a just, climate-safe future."" Similarly, some of the other groups the White House has consulted with about its upcoming power plant rule have recently issued policy briefs arguing in favor of a rapid decarbonization of the nation's power grid. The reports were attached as part of the federal filings reporting the meetings. WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO BOOST GREEN ENERGY IN COMMUNITIES REELING FROM COAL PLANT SHUTDOWNS ""To close the gaps between our climate and clean power targets and our current trajectory, and to further advance President Bidens critical climate and environmental justice commitments, the Biden Administration must take decisive executive action to cut pollution and advance clean electricity in the power sector over the next two years,"" states one of the briefs published in January by Evergreen Action and NRDC. The brief advocates for the federal government to pursue an aggressive regulatory framework ensuring 80% of the nation's grid is fueled by green energy by 2030 and is completely carbon-free by 2035. Another report, commissioned by the Sierra Club, criticized efforts to expand carbon capture technology to reduce emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden signed into law last year, included sizable tax credits for carbon capture and storage, an advanced technology that reduces emissions from fossil fuel power plants. ECO REGULATIONS FORCE MASSIVE COAL PLANT TO SHUT DOWN, SPARKING COMMUNITY UPROAR ""The results of this assessment highlight how a generation owner might seek to game the new tax credit policy for the benefit of investors or other incumbent interests at the expense of the environment and ratepayers,"" the Sierra Club report states. ""New tax credits may appear to justify an enormous upfront capital investment to build carbon capture, which favors incumbent generation interests."" ""Whether capture equipment will ultimately work as intended, however, is uncertain. Even if it does work as intended, the investment may barely reduce, or even increase, net emissions."" In addition to the environmental groups, White House officials also met with representatives of nine Democratic state attorneys general led by New York and California; the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group that advocates for a green transition; and various utility companies that have installed a large share of the nation's green energy capacity in recent years. The revelation that top administration officials have engaged with leading left-wing climate groups to craft the power plant rule, comes days after reports indicated the EPA is prepared to issue the most aggressive-ever power plant emissions reduction plan. On Saturday, The New York Times reported the EPA is finalizing the plan which would require coal- and natural gas-fired power plants to cut or capture the vast majority of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2040. The regulation, if finalized, would represent the first-ever federal action curbing power plant emissions.  Overall, there are 3,393 fossil fuel-fired power plants nationwide, the majority of which are natural gas plants, according to the most recent federal data. Those plants generate more than 60% of the nation's electricity, compared to the roughly 14% of electricity generated by wind and solar projects. However, EPA data shows that the electric power sector accounts for about 25% of total U.S. emissions, placing it behind only the transportation sector and slightly ahead of the industrial sector. As such, fossil fuel power plants have been targeted by environmentalists and Democratic lawmakers who argue that emissions must be reduced in an effort to stave off cataclysmic climate change.",25/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-furiously-consulting-eco-groups-ahead-expected-power-plant-crackdown
Climate activists shut down WH clean energy czar John Podesta's speech to 'room full of millionaires',"A group of climate activists shut down an event Tuesday where senior White House adviser John Podesta delivered remarks about the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act. The activists, who are with the group Climate Defiance, entered a hotel ballroom in Washington, D.C., where Podesta was speaking with Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) President Manish Bapna while chanting anti-fossil fuel slogans, according to video posted by the group. The activists then assembled near the front of the room and unfurled a banner that stated ""End Fossil Fuels."" ""No more drilling! Keep your promise!"" the protesters shouted as they entered. ""Everyone's future is undone, you guys,"" one of the activists said. ""We never needed fossil fuels. You all need to stop supporting it. You all are going to be complicit to the destruction of Mother Earth and everyone's future."" WH ADVISER JOHN PODESTA STAFFING UP WITH FAR-LEFT CLIMATE ACTIVISTS: 'NEED TO SET AMBITIOUS GOALS' ""What does it mean if Biden is saying no new drilling on federal lands, and we get an expansion of projects 30 years into the future?"" another activist added. The comments appeared to be in reference to President Biden's recent approval of the Willow Project, a massive 30-year oil drilling project located in northern Alaska. The project's developer projected it would produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day over the next three decades. CLIMATE ACTIVISTS ARRESTED AFTER BLOCKING RUSH-HOUR DC TRAFFIC The Willow Project approval was announced by the Department of the Interior in March, but the decision was ultimately made by Biden and White House officials including Podesta. The decision sparked an internal dispute between officials with some seeking to tank the project from within. ""I appreciate their passion and we're trying to create a transition that gets to net-zero by 2050. Their point of view "" Podesta stated before being interrupted again by the protesters. ""Too late! That is too late! Thirty years!"" they yelled. Climate Defiance later tweeted a video of the protest, claiming they shut down Podesta's ""keynote speech."" ""Addressing a room full of millionaires in a 5-star hotel, Podesta said we can only get to net-zero by 2050,"" the group tweeted. ""So we sang him off the stage."" BIDEN ADMIN DELIVERS BLOW TO FOSSIL FUEL PROJECT IN VICTORY FOR ECO GROUPS Meanwhile, the NRDC, the group that appeared to host the event Tuesday, is among several groups that filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration last month, challenging its approval of the Willow Project. An official for the group said at the time that the administration was ""green-lighting a carbon bomb.""  And Podesta has made fighting climate change a top priority since assuming his position at the White House and before in his role leading the left-wing Center for American Progress. Biden appointed Podesta to lead the White House Office of Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation, a role that includes overseeing billions of dollars in Inflation Reduction Act spending.",26/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-activists-shut-down-wh-clean-energy-czar-john-podestas-speech-room-full-millionaires
Scientists report climate change worsened Eastern Africa drought,"The ongoing drought in Eastern Africa has been made worse by human-induced climate change, which also made it much likelier to occur in the first place, an international team of climate scientists concluded. The report Thursday came from World Weather Attribution, a group that seeks to quickly determine whether certain extreme weather events were influenced by climate change. Nineteen scientists from seven nations assessed how climate change affected rainfall in the region. ""Climate change caused the low rainfall in the region,"" Joyce Kimutai, principal meteorologist at the Kenya Meteorological Department said. ""Climate change has made the drought exceptional."" The scientists analyzed historical weather data, including changes in the two main rainfall patterns in the region alongside computer model simulations dating back to the 1800s. They found that the long rains season March through May  was turning drier and the short rains season  typically October through December  was becoming wetter due to climate change. The report also said a ""strong increase"" in evaporation from soil and plants due to higher temperatures had worsened the droughts severity. They called the regions experience with drought ""one of a kind."" HOUSE REJECTS GAETZ RESOLUTION TO REMOVE US TROOPS FROM SOMALIA Friederike Otto, senior climate scientist at Imperial College London and the leader of the study, said it underscored how climate change's effects ""strongly depend on how vulnerable we are."" While climate change has made drought more frequent and extreme in the Horn region, the scientists acknowledged that previous failed rainy seasons, high temperatures, conflict, fragile statehood and poverty are also to blame for the ""devastating impacts."" The United Nations said more than 20 million people in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda and South Sudan have been affected by the drought, with more than 2.2 million displaced in Somalia and Ethiopia and severe maternal risks to hundreds of thousands of expectant or breastfeeding women. Rod Beadle, head of relief and humanitarian affairs at Food for the Hungry, said almost 15 million children are exposed to acute malnourishment. ""Despite the recent rains in North Kenya, the pressure from previous failed seasons makes for a dire situation. The flooding has impacted livestock and many pastoralists lost their primary livelihoods. The drought conditions have resulted in severely compacted soil that cannot absorb the water; hence the floods are more severe. The country is also facing severe outbreaks of cholera and other diseases as more refugees arrive,"" Beadle said.  Development gains in the countries have been offset by a long history of natural disasters, famine and disease, said Guyo Malicha Roba, a food security expert who heads the Jameel Observatory, which works on food insecurity issues in dryland nations. Roba said the food situation in the regions drylands has addressed by raising money and with food distributions from governments and humanitarian partners, but more work needs to be done to use early-warning systems to respond more quickly to ""food shocks.""",27/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/world/scientists-report-climate-change-worsened-eastern-africa-drought
Navy secretary defends calling climate change a top priority: ??qually important??to other goals,"Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro on Friday defended his recent remark that climate change is a ""top priority"" for the Navy and said he thinks the issue is just as important for the Navy as ensuring a steady stream of sailor recruits. At a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., noted Del Toros prior comments about the importance of climate change and asked Del Toro how that issue stacks up with others, at a time when the Navy is struggling to meet its recruiting goals. ""In the military, we know when you make one thing a priority you have to acknowledge that other things might be less of a priority,"" Banks said. ""So where does climate change factor into the priorities that you have as the secretary of the Navy?"" NAVY SECRETARY CITED CLIMATE CHANGE AS TOP PRIORITY AS BIDEN PROPOSES SHRINKING THE FLEET ""As I said then, it is a top priority,"" Del Toro replied. ""Let me give you an example. When I was commanding officer of the USS Bulkeley I tied up to one of our new piers in Norfolk...."" Banks interrupted to ask whether climate change was as important as recruiting for the Navy, and whether it was as important as expanding the U.S. fleet. ""Theyre all equally important. They all have an impact on our combat readiness,"" Del Toro said. ""I stated what my adjutant priorities are: Strengthen maritime dominance, strengthen our cultural warfighting excellence, and improve our relationships with our allies and partners around the world, and climate is included in all three of those,"" he added. NAVY RENAMES SHIP OVER TIES TO CONFEDERATE OFFICER When pressed later in the hearing on the same issue, Del Toro clarified, ""I never said climate change was the number one priority, I said climate change was a top priority."" The exchange took place just weeks after Del Toro made waves in a speech in the Bahamas that climate change has been one of his top priorities since he took office. ""The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps team has been working on climate and energy security for a long time,"" he said then. ""And we are accelerating and broadening those efforts."" Del Toro has defended that position even as Republicans charge that he, the Pentagon and the Biden administration are losing sight of the main focus of the military in order to pursue extraneous goals like climate, equity and eliminating extremism in the ranks. CHINA OUTPACING US IN WARSHIP PRODUCTION, NAVY SECRETARY WARNS The Navy and other service branches have had difficulty recruiting new service members. Last September, the Navy said it met its goal for fiscal year 2022 but had to reduce the number of delayed entry sailors to get there. The Navy has also been criticized for the disconnect between remarks from Del Toro and other leaders who say they want a 355-ship fleet, and the annual budget request, which each year under Biden has called for shrinking the fleet from the roughly 296 ships it currently has in operation.  On Friday, Del Toro again faced tough questions on the budget despite its call for a smaller fleet, in questioning from Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va. ""Im not a mathematician, but I do not know any laws of math that allow you to do addition by subtraction,"" he said of the latest budget, which calls for building nine ships and retiring 11.",28/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/navy-secretary-defends-calling-climate-change-top-priority-equally-important-other-goals
Republican lawmakers rally to condemn Biden's proposed electric vehicle rule: 'Climate change extremism',"Republicans in the House of Representatives rallied together Friday to condemn President Biden's proposed new rule on vehicle emissions that they say amounts to another step towards the administration's ""radical"" goal of requiring half of all new vehicles to be fully electric by 2030. According to the proposed rule announced by the administration earlier this month, automakers would be required to ensure a massive 56% greenhouse gas emissions reduction in 2032 vehicles compared to 2026 models, likely forcing companies to produce electric alternatives more rapidly. In a letter sent to the White House on Friday, 33 House Republicans led by Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, said the new rule ""will have devastating consequences for manufacturers and consumers"" if implemented, and would likely increase America's reliance on China's stronghold on the electric vehicle (EV) battery industry. GRANHOLM'S CALL FOR 100% EV MILITARY PUTS ELECTRIC TANKS, GREEN AGENDA BEFORE NATIONAL SECURITY: CRITICS ""The rule ignores how EV batteries are obtained. Batteries are made using costly rare earth minerals such as lithium, cobalt and graphite. Manufacturers will struggle to acquire these minerals in a timely manner,"" the letter said. ""Moreover, many of these minerals are imported from Communist China, which produces 70% of the world's EV batteries. Just as our great power competition with China heats up, your rule would have the practical effect of supporting  and deepening our dependence on  China's massive EV industry,"" it said. The letter expressed concern that the U.S. electric grid wasn't ready for half of all cars to be fully electric, arguing more charging stations and grid upgrades would be required beforehand. It also argued that EV batteries posed their own environmental hazards by ""exacerbating water pollution and contributing to toxic waste,"" among other negative consequences for consumers. BIDEN ENERGY SECRETARY DOUBLES DOWN ON ELECTRIFYING US MILITARY'S VEHICLE FLEET BY 2030: WE CAN GET THERE It then called for the administration to answer how it planned to promote the materials needed for EV batteries without increasing dependence on China, what it had learned from America's chip shortage, if it had considered the negative effects the proposed rule could have on the car market, what it would say to consumers who don't want to drive an EV, and what evidence it had to show the electric grid could currently support such an increase in EVs. In a statement shared following the group's letter to Biden, Self described what he saw as a direct line between the administration's proposed new rule and American liberty itself. ""Climate change extremism has served as the pretext for unrestricted encroachments on American liberty. The Biden administrations latest proposal to curb emission standards hypocritically ignores the significant environmental harm that EV battery production causes and their toxicity,"" he said. The Biden administration has also faced sharp criticism over its calls for a 100% EV military, something critics have said is putting ""electric tanks"" and a green agenda ahead of America's national security.

Dems demand federal rule change forcing companies to follow California?? ??reen??marketing rules,"California Attorney General Rob Bonta is pushing for a change in Federal Trade Commission regulations that would require all U.S. companies to abide by California standards that govern when a company can advertise itself as ""green."" In a letter last week, Bonta and 15 other blue state AGs called on to FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan to adjust the agency's Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, or ""Green Guides.""

SAN DIEGO UNDER FIRE FOR 'FRUITLESS' PLAN TO HOUSE HOMELESS IN 3 HOTELS AT NEARLY $400K PER ROOM ""We are urging the federal government to go even further in developing strong standards to protect people from misleading information and to establish a stringent baseline for environmental marketing claims,"" he said. FORMER CALIFORNIA DEM LEADER TORCHES NEWSOM'S BID FOR FEDERAL FUNDING TO HOUSE HOMELESS: POLITICAL ANIMAL Bonta says he wants to ""expand the scope of the Green Guides to consider how the standards for each environmental marketing claim could be clarified and strengthened to better ensure they are supported by real environmental benefits."" But Bontas action was criticized by a Republican counterpart who says the request is out-of-bounds for attorneys general. ""Attorneys general must ensure that unelected federal bureaucrats cant just issue whatever rule they want in order to further their radical climate agenda, not encourage them,"" Republican AG Andrew Bailey of Missouri told Fox News Digital in a statement. The AG's wrote that, ""the stated purpose of the Green Guides is to help marketers avoid deceptive environmental claims under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act."" ""The Guides have come to play an important role in establishing the bounds of such claims,"" they said. BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY PLANS POSE NATIONAL SECURITY RISK, PENTAGON WARNS ""Indeed, as our States endeavor to address critical environmental issues  climate change, the pollution of our air and water, emerging contaminants, and solid waste disposal, among so many others  the value of baseline standards for evaluating whether environmental marketing or promotional claims are deceptive and thus potentially unlawful under consumer protection laws cannot be overstated,"" they wrote. ""Our efforts are wholly undermined by such unscrupulous environmental marketing."" For example, the states are asking that the FTC require that if businesses that want to make a renewable energy claim, it should be ""underwritten by actual environmental benefit, wherein marketers who make renewable energy claims must actually procure and use renewable energy."" Among other things, the AG's also want the FTC to change the definition of ""compostable"" to incorporate both scientific standards and the known practical limitations of composting at scale.  ""FTC should make explicit that recyclable means what the FTC has intended it to mean and what consumers understand it to mean: that when the consumer properly disposes of a ""recyclable"" item, it is actually recycled as a matter of course,"" Bonta said. Bailey said that such changes would not only be additional burden to companies, it would also unconstitutionally bypass Congress.

"Climate chaos? Bugs will thrive in an ever-warming world, say scientists","Biologists at Michigan State University (MSU) have been studying damselflies  which resemble dragonflies and are abundant as both predator and prey in wetlands  in order to understand what happens throughout their lifecycle from nymph to winged insect, along with what they eat, when summers grow warmer and longer, according to MSU Today.  Now, a new study from MSU suggests bugs will thrive in an ever-warming world. Researchers discovered that damselflies were birthing an extra set of larvae each year to keep up with rapid changes of the worlds weather, according to SWNS, a British news agency, which also reported on the study.  ODD BUGS: FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT PRAYING MANTISES, WALKING STICKS AND OTHER UNIQUE-LOOK INSECTS  The lifecycles of the bugs from Michigan were shown to mirror those of their southern relatives living in warmer climates  and this was successfully keeping them alive, the same source reported. This contradicts many scientific models that suggested global warming would doom predator-prey species such as the damselfly. The MSU team felt that current predictions of the impact of climate change on animals were unrealistic  and that those predictions didnt factor in how critters might behave differently in various temperatures. Other models only simulated what would happen if damselflies lived a one-year lifecycle in a warmer world  concluding they would burn out, die, and potentially become extinct. The bugs could actually thrive if they birthed an extra generation each season. MSUs team found the bugs could actually thrive if they birthed an extra generation each season. The study's co-author Phoebe Zarnetske, an associate professor of integrative biology at MSU, said in a media statement, ""We are seeing the pace of climate change is much more rapid than organisms have endured in their evolutionary experience."" GOOD LUCK OMENS! WHY THE PRAYING MANTIS, BUTTERFLY AND LADYBUG ARE THOUGHT TO BRING GOOD THINGS  She also said, ""That rapid pace is going to be even more of an issue with the increase in extreme events like heat waves."" To build the new model, a mathematician worked on observational and experimental work in the field and laboratory to build a more robust model simulating the future for predators and prey, SWNS reported of the study. By studying how temperature changes affect insects in the field, the team said it believes their predictions are much more realistic. The research began when Dr. Laura Twardochleb, a pupil of Professor Zarnetske, spent a year watching damselflies' complex lives, SWNS said. ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, APRIL 22, 1970, FIRST EARTH DAY, IS CELEBRATED: RARE POLITICAL ALIGNMENT The insects emerge as adults from ponds in the spring  then mate and reproduce. The juveniles spend over a year in a pond growing by eating zooplankton. Dr. Twardochleb saw that early models projecting how warming climates would affect predators such as the damselfly were far simpler than the nature she was observing. They didnt allow for the norths changing seasons. They also did not keep track of a predators size, growth or how their lifestyle changed with the hotter weather, SWNS noted. Professor Chris Klausmeier, a mathematician and theoretical ecologist at MSU, incorporated Dr. Twardochlebs observations with his own theory. The team laid the groundwork for future investigations into how various species will adapt to a warmer world, said Dr. Twardochleb. He said, ""I can make up any model I want unconstrained by reality. But thats a little dangerous because of course you want something related to the real world,"" according to SWNS reporting. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER ""When you join with an experimentalist, you can bring not just the experimental results and parameters, but also bring the deep natural history and knowledge to the system to know the key variables and constraints.""  Dr. Twardochleb wrote in Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences, a research journal, that the team had laid the groundwork for future investigations into how various species will adapt to a warmer world, particularly disease-carrying mosquitoes. She added, as SWNS also reported, ""A lot of models said predators were going to starve. Thats whats exciting  that we can make models more realistic.""",30/04/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/climate-chaos-bugs-will-thrive-ever-warming-world-scientists
Biden quietly backs behemoth natural gas project despite pleas from climate activists,"The Biden administration formally issued a record of decision Monday to green-light a massive Alaska natural gas pipeline and export project that's strongly opposed by environmental groups. The Department of Energy's (DOE) finalized decision reaffirms the original 2020 approval of the project under the Trump administration but amends it to include additional environmental protections, according to federal filings. The $38.7 billion project  which involves an 807-mile pipeline that traverses the length of Alaska and an export terminal  would significantly boost U.S. natural gas exports to Asia. Project developer Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC), a state-owned venture founded to ensure Alaskans benefit financially from the state's natural gas reserves, applauded the record of decision, saying it would enable the U.S. to boost energy supplies to allies. ""This order is terrific news for the Alaska LNG (liquefied natural gas) project,"" AGDC President Frank Richards said in April after the decision was first issued. ""The Biden administration has reaffirmed the authorization for and climate benefits of Alaska LNG, which will provide Alaskans and U.S. allies with a significant source of low-emissions, responsibly produced energy consistent with international environmental priorities."" BIDEN ADMIN DELIVERS BLOW TO FOSSIL FUEL PROJECT IN VICTORY FOR ECO GROUPS ""This supplemental decision adds to the record of support for Alaska LNG and our work developing this important project continues,"" Richards added. DOE's decision, which prevents venting carbon dioxide and reaffirms prior environmental requirements, ultimately allows the project developer to export LNG to non-free trade agreement nations. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved construction of the project in May 2020, years after it was first proposed in 2014.  Under the proposal, the developer would construct a pipeline that stretches from Alaska's natural gas-rich North Slope Borough to Cook Inlet in southern Alaska where an export terminal facility would be built. The project would be among the only LNG export terminals anywhere in the West. BIDEN ADMIN RECEIVES BACKLASH FROM NEARLY TWO DOZEN GROUPS FOR MOVE CRACKING DOWN ON GAS STOVES ""It's the only major LNG project in America that's got all its permits  it's got state and federal. That's not easy to do,"" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, who has advocated for the project, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""It's got its export license. That's also not easy to do, from DOE. And, importantly, it's got federal loan guarantees. So, it's the only major project in our country that's got the full faith and credit of the United States of America backing it."" ""These are great jobs. So, it's a win for the economy, win for American families, win for Alaskans getting clean-burning gas themselves, and helping our allies not only get off Russian oil and gas but flex the muscle that [President] Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party are scared to death of: American energy dominance. Especially if we're sending it to Asia,"" he continued. In October, Sullivan, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel and State Department senior energy adviser Amos Hochstein participated in a summit in Tokyo with Japanese officials to tout the benefits of the project. Overall, according to AGDC, the project would create 10,000 jobs during construction and 1,000 permanent jobs. It would also have an average throughput of 3.1 billion cubic feet (bcf) of LNG per day, much of which would be delivered to Alaskans. The DOE decision published Monday authorizes the project to export 2.6 bcf of LNG per day. By comparison, the electric power sector across the entire West Coast  California, Oregon and Washington  consumed 2.4 bcf of natural gas per day last year, according to federal data. ""I've always said that there is a split within this administration. The rational people understand that we're going to need energy, American energy, for decades to come,"" said Sullivan. ""They should be touting it more. But, you know, they have to kowtow to their far-left wing."" Environmental groups, meanwhile, blasted the Biden administration's approval of the project, saying it would lead to a massive uptick in greenhouse emissions.  ""Not only is the Alaska LNG project unnecessary given the widespread transition to clean-energy alternatives we expect to see in the years to come, its also a major threat to ecosystems and climate in Alaska,"" said Erin Colon, a senior attorney for Earthjustice, an environmental law firm that has challenged the project in court. ""The states greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels would balloon by nearly 30% over todays levels in an era where all other states will be scrambling to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Colon added. ""Its frustrating to see the Department of Energy rubber-stamp a massive fossil fuel infrastructure project of this kind when it clearly conflicts with the urgent need to tackle the climate crisis.""",01/05/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-backs-behemoth-natural-gas-pipeline-liquefied-natural-gas-lng-alaska-gasline-development-corporation-climate-activists
"As US heat waves worsen and intensify, older people become increasingly at risk of dying","Paramedics summoned to an Arizona retirement community last summer found an 80-year-old woman slumped inside her mobile home, enveloped in the suffocating 99-degree heat she suffered for days after her air conditioner broke down. Efforts to revive her failed, and her death was ruled environmental heat exposure aggravated by heart disease and diabetes. In Americas hottest big metro, older people like the Sun Lakes mobile home resident accounted for most of the 77 people who died last summer in broiling heat inside their homes, almost all without air conditioning. Now, the heat dangers long known in greater Phoenix are becoming familiar nationwide as global warming creates new challenges to protect the aged. From the Pacific Northwest to Chicago to North Carolina, health clinics, utilities and local governments are being tested to keep older people safe when temperatures soar. Theyre adopting rules for disconnecting electricity, mandating when to switch on communal air conditioning and improving communication with at-risk people living alone. Situated in the Sonoran Desert, Phoenix and its suburbs are ground zero for heat-associated deaths in the U.S. Such fatalities are so common that Arizonas largest county keeps a weekly online tally during the six-month hot season from May through October. Temperatures this year were already hitting the high 90s the first week of April. VERMONT GOV. SCOTT SLAMS LEGISLATURE'S GREEN HEAT BILL FOR UNAFFORDABILITY, PROMISES VETO A Warming World ""Phoenix really is the model for what well be seeing in other places,"" said researcher Jennifer Ailshire, a native of the desert city now at the University of Southern California's Leonard Davis School of Gerontology where she studies how environmental factors affect health and aging. ""The world is changing rapidly and I fear we are not acting fast enough to teach people how harmful rising temperatures can be."" A 2021 study estimated more than a third of U.S. heat deaths each year can be attributed to human-caused global warming. It found more than 1,100 deaths a year from climate change-caused heat in some 200 U.S. cities, many in the East and Midwest, where people often dont have air conditioning or are not acclimated to hot weather. Another study showed that in coming decades dangerous heat will hit much of the world at least three times as hard as climate change worsens. Isolated and vulnerable, the heat victims last year during Maricopa County's deadliest summer on record included a couple in their 80s without known relatives, an 83-year-old woman with dementia living alone after her husband entered hospice care and a 62-year-old Rwandan refugee whose air conditioner broke down. While most of the county's confirmed 378 heat-associated deaths were outdoors, those who died indoors were especially vulnerable because of isolation, mobility issues or medical problems as outside summertime highs hit 115 degrees. Older people of color, with a greater tendency for chronic conditions like diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure are especially at risk. In Chicago, three African American women in their 60s and 70s died in spring 2022 when the centrally controlled heating in their housing complex remained on and the air conditioning was off despite unseasonable 90-degree weather in mid-May. An undetermined number of older people died during the summer of 2021 when an unexpected heat wave swept across the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Canada reported that coroners confirmed more than 600 people died from the heat in neighboring British Columbia. Checking On Older People Many U.S. cities, including Phoenix, have plans to protect people during heat waves, opening cooling centers and distributing bottled water. But many older people need personalized attention, said Dr. Aaron Bernstein, who directs the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""If you are elderly and sick you are unlikely to get into an Uber or bus to get to a cooling center,"" said Bernstein, who vividly recalls a 1995 heat wave that killed 739 mostly older people in Chicago, his hometown. ""So many were socially isolated and at tremendous risk."" Sociologist Eric M. Klinenberg, who wrote about the catastrophe in his book ""Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago,"" has noted social contacts can protect older people during disasters. ""Older people are more prone to live alone,"" he said, ""and they are the most likely to die."" That's true of all extreme weather. When Hurricane Katrina devastated Louisiana in 2005, around half of the 1,000 people killed were 75 or older, most of them drowned when their homes flooded. Chicago encourages residents to check on older relatives and neighbors on hot days and city workers visit people's home. But last year's deaths at a Chicago apartment house shows more is needed. Community Health Clinics Can Help Bernstein's center is working with relief organization Americares to help community health clinics prepare vulnerable patients for heat waves and other extreme weather. A ""climate resilience tool kit"" includes tips like making sure patients have wall thermometers and know how to check weather forecasts on a smart phone. Patients learn simple ways to beat the heat, like taking a shower or sponge bath to cool off and drinking plenty of water. Alexis Hodges, a family nurse practitioner at the Community Care Clinic of Dare in coastal North Carolina, said rising temperatures can cause renal failure in patients with kidney problems and exacerbate dehydration from medications like diuretics. Hodges contributed to the climate kit from a region that experiences all the weather events it covers: extreme heat, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. At the nonprofit Mountain Park Health centers that annually serve 100,000 patients in greater Phoenix, nurse practitioner Anthony Carano has written numerous letters to utility companies for low-income patients with chronic conditions, asking them not to turn off power despite missed payments. ""This is such an at-risk population,"" Carano said of the overwhelmingly Latino patient population that suffer from diabetes and other ailments aggravated by warm weather. About one-tenth of the patients are 60 and older. Francisca Canes, a 77-year-old patient visiting for back pain, said she's fortunate to live with two daughters who take care of her during hot spells. In the summertime, she stays in shape by joining several women friends at 4 a.m. most mornings for a 4-mile walk. NEW YORK MOVES TO BECOME FIRST STATE BANNING NATURAL GAS HOOKUPS Air Conditioner Replacement And Repair Maricopa County in April used federal funds to to allocate another $10 million to its air conditioner replacement and repair program for people who qualify, brining total funding to $13.65 million. In greater Phoenix and several rural Arizona counties, older low-income people can apply for free repair or replacement of air conditioners through a separate non-profit program. The Healthy Homes Air Conditioning Program run by the nonprofit Foundation for Senior Living last summer ensured about 30 people got new air conditioners or repairs and helped others with home improvements. Priority goes to older people, those with disabilities and families with very small children, who are also vulnerable to the heat. A person living alone must earn $27,180 or less, said Laura Simone, program coordinator for FSL Home Improvements. The program recently installed energy efficient windows in the 1930s home of 81-year-old widow Socorro Silvas. ""I am so grateful they are taking care of low-income people like me,"" said Silvas, who got her air conditioner in the middle of a sweltering summer several years ago through a program run by Tolleson, a suburb west of Phoenix. Utility companies can also help protect vulnerable people by halting power disconnections during hot periods. ""In Arizona, air conditioning is a matter of life and death, especially if you are older,"" said Dana Kennedy, the state director of AARP, which has fought for stricter regulations preventing summertime power cutoffs.  Stricter Regulations New rules for Arizona utilities were adopted after 72-year-old Stephanie Pullman died in August 2018 at her Phoenix area home as outside temperatures reached 107 degrees. The medical examiner's office said Pullman died from ""environmental heat exposure"" combined with cardiovascular disease after her power was shut off over a $176.84. debt. The Arizona agency that regulates utilities now bans electricity cutoffs for nonpayment during the hottest months. After the three Chicago women died last year, residential buildings for older people in the city now must provide air-conditioned common areas and administrators no longer have to keep centrally controlled heat on during unseasonably warm weather. The Illinois state Senate recently passed legislation requiring that all affordable housing have air-conditioning operating when the temperature is 80 degrees or higher and must be operable by residents. Kennedy said mobile homes are especially dangerous as high temperatures transform them into a hot metal containers. ""A lot are not insulated,"" said Kennedy, who has advised an Arizona State University group working to make mobile homes safer with more surrounding shade and on-site cooling centers. ""These heat deaths truly are heartbreaking. But in many cases we can help prevent them.""",01/05/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-heat-waves-worsen-intensify-older-people-increasingly-risk-dying
Climate protestor glues self to podium on live Swiss TV,"An environmental activist stormed the set of a Swiss television debate and glued himself to a podium while live on air, only to be extracted, heels dragging, a few minutes later. Local station Leman Bleu had erected the red-carpet set in a historic arcade much frequented by tourists, near Geneva City Hall, with the public and passers-by invited to look on. The man who ran onto the set wore a T-shirt with the words for ""Act Together"" in French and the logo of the Extinction Rebellion activist group written on the back. CLIMATE ACTIVISTS FACE VATICAN TRIAL OVER DAMAGE TO FAMOUS STATUE The episode took place Sunday as the TV station was hosting a discussion among candidates around a second, decisive round of local elections. The networks editorial director and presenter, Jeremy Seydoux, was initially surprised by the stunt, seeming to recoil. He then scolded the activist, who was wearing a beard and ponytail, even as the presenter tried to continued the program despite the disruption. ""No, no, sir, youre not going to glue yourself to the set. I don't believe it!"" said Seydoux, wagging a finger at the activist as the crowd jeered and booed. ""Oh-la-la! Its a shame. Its a shame, sir, youre taking a democratic program hostage. ... I refuse to co-host this show with you. CLIMATE ACTIVISTS IN BERLIN GLUE THEMSELVES TO AIRPORT RUNWAY, DISRUPTING AIR TRAVEL ""You have strictly nothing to say, and I will now ask you to be evacuated,"" he added, before sighing: ""What an afternoon!"" A technician in a headset inspected the scene, but could not immediately figure out how to dislodge the activist, who proceeded to chat into the microphone of Switzerlands public network, RTS. Shortly afterward, technicians equipped with solvent arrived to remove the man and escort him away  though he struggled a bit and sat down to slow the eviction. Police then moved in to help, and the crowd jeered more as he was taken away.  The stunt echoed recent protests by Germany's Last Generation movement, whose climate activists have drawn attention for bringing traffic to a standstill by gluing themselves to the road.",01/05/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/world/climate-protestor-glues-self-podium-live-swiss-tv
Biden's funding for UN green energy projects faces Republican roadblock,"FIRST ON FOX: A Republican lawmaker is introducing legislation Tuesday that would prohibit the federal government from making voluntary contributions to the United Nations Green Climate Fund. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., a member of the House Budget Committee, authored the bill  the No Taxpayer Funding for United Nations Green Climate Fund Act  in an effort to restrict the extent to which U.S. taxpayers fund global green energy projects. The so-called Green Climate Fund was established in 2010 to help steer funds from Western nations to the developing world for climate technology. ""No taxpayers, in Virginia's Fifth District or across the country, should have to foot the bill for the United Nations radical and unscientific climate agenda,"" Good told Fox News Digital.  ""The Biden Administration pledge of $1 billion to Green Climate Fund will only undermine the American economy and our energy independence in the name of climate alarmism,"" the Virginia Republican added. UN CLIMATE REPORT IS LATEST IN STRING OF CATACLYSMIC PREDICTIONS STRETCHING BACK DECADES On April 20, President Biden announced his administration would provide $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund which he said was ""critical"" for helping poorer nations to develop green energy projects and stave off climate change. The president also requested $500 million for an Amazon Rainforest restoration fund and called on world leaders to join in giving to international climate efforts. UN CALLS FOR MASS FOSSIL FUEL SHUTDOWNS TO PREVENT 'CLIMATE TIME BOMB' ""As large economies and large emitters, we must step up and support these economies,"" Biden remarked on April 20 at the virtual Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate. ""So today, Im pleased to announce the United States is going to provide $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund, a fund that that is cri-  fund is a  critical in ways to help developing nations that they cant do now."" ""But it should not be the only way,"" he continued. ""Together, we need to strengthen the role of multilateral development banks in fighting climate crisis as well, starting with the World Bank.  Because climate security, energy security, food security, theyre all related. Theyre all related."" Biden first announced his intention to boost U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund early in his presidency. He increased the overall annual funding goal to more than $11 billion during a 2021 speech to the United Nations in New York City. His administration hopes to reach that annual figure by 2024. The president's proposed budgets have also routinely requested billions of dollars for ""international climate assistance and financing."" Former President Barack Obama promised $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund shortly after its creation. However, his administration fell far short of that goal. The fund was originally designed to give $100 billion to developing countries by 2020, but has instead raised a tiny fraction of that amount.  And former President Donald Trump completely backed out of international climate finance agreements altogether, explaining that they would cost taxpayers a ""vast fortune."" ""Of course, the worlds top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated,"" Trump remarked in June 2017, shortly after he took office. ""America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure."" ""Millions of our citizens are out of work,"" he continued. ""And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that.""",02/05/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-funding-un-green-energy-projects-faces-republican-roadblock
Biden's radical climate agenda wants to keep you unplugged,"Does the radical climate change agenda know no end? Earlier this year, it was gas stoves -- and then lightbulbs. Then, a few weeks ago, President Joe Biden's administration announced much less gas cars after 2032. Even though about half of Americans say they don't want an electric car and only 6% of drivers are buying them. But that was child's play compared to the latest Biden scheme to shut down as many as half our electric power plants across the country. These are the plants that charge those Tesla batteries and cellphones. They also keep the lights on in our factories, schools, hospitals, stores, and homes and power the internet. Further, they cook our food and keep us warm at night. No, that power doesn't just come magically from the socket in the wall. BIDEN ADMIN PREPARING MAJOR CRACKDOWN ON POWER PLANTS THAT FUEL NATION'S GRID Most of the electric power supply in America and around the world comes from fossil fuels. Coal, gas and oil power plants account for more than 60% of the electric power we use in the United States today. Only about 20% comes from wind and solar power. Hold that thought. Because the Biden administration has announced what The Washington Post calls a plan to ""drastically reduce (power plant) greenhouse gas emissions."" These cuts are so stringent that most of our gas- and coal-fired plants would be technologically incapable of complying. But here's what's sinister:  That's the point of these rules -- to wrench fossil fuels from our energy supply altogether. Our electric grid system is already stressed to the limits. States that have tried to switch to green energy -- California comes to mind -- are having to undergo dangerous blackouts and brownouts. This is what happens in Third World countries. It isn't supposed to happen here.  BIDEN UNVEILS TOUGHEST-EVER CAR EMISSIONS RULES IN BID TO FORCE ELECTRIC VEHICLE PURCHASES Where are we going to get the electric power to charge 150 million EVs every night? From windmills? Remember, these new Environmental Protection Agency rules come just weeks after Biden announced cars would soon no longer be fueled with gas, oil or diesel. Yet now, we are going to shut down more power plants?  The Biden administration says that coal and gas plants will have to pay for carbon offsets to make up for their carbon emissions. Who's going to pay for that? We all will with much higher utility bills.  If you want to cripple an industrial economy like that of the U.S., a good way to do so is to dismantle its energy supply. Who is the president residing in the White House these days? Joe Biden or Dr. Evil?  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER No country has cleaned its air more than the U.S. has over the last many decades. The Institute for Energy Research reports that our air pollution emissions -- including lead, sulfur, carbon monoxide and particulates -- have fallen by a combined 74% over the past 50 years. We have the cleanest air in any of our lifetimes. Even our carbon dioxide emissions have fallen in recent years more than any other country, thanks to natural gas production.  We aren't the problem. China is, and you can be sure they're not doing anything to slow their economy.  These new EPA regulations aren't about breathing cleaner air or changing the temperature of the planet. They are a dangerous assault on the American free enterprise system and U.S. global leadership. Biden thinks his legacy will be as the president who fought global warming.  Wrong.

Biden nominee pushing electric vehicles faces massive opposition from energy industry,"FIRST ON FOX: A large coalition of 43 of the most influential oil and gas industry trade groups are opposing President Biden's nominee to lead a Department of Transportation safety subagency. The coalition  led by the Western Energy Alliance and joined by the American Petroleum Institute and National Ocean Industries Association among others  penned a letter Wednesday to Senate leaders, announcing their adamant opposition to Ann Carlson's nomination to lead the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  The groups argued that Carlson's past statements suggest she is willing to skirt the agency's mission and implement far-reaching climate policies to promote electric vehicles (EV). Congress established NHTSA in 1970 to improve the safety of passenger cars amid a surge in traffic accidents and deaths. ""[Carlson's] multiple public statements reveal a clear agenda to go beyond NHTSAs congressionally mandated mission on vehicle performance and safety standards and turn it into a climate change enforcement body,"" the coalition wrote. ""We are also concerned by Carlsons lack of transparency about her work promoting spurious climate change litigation."" BIDEN UNVEILS TOUGHEST-EVER CAR EMISSIONS RULES IN BID TO FORCE ELECTRIC VEHICLE PURCHASES ""Today, the most pressing concern of NHTSA is not climate change impacts decades into the future but traffic safety in the here and now,"" the letter continued. ""Americans face real dangers from distracted and impaired drivers behind the wheel and potential vehicle safety standard violations."" Fox News Digital reported in April that Carlson privately boasted in 2021 emails obtained by a watchdog group that she was recruited by the administration to oversee climate standards for cars and trucks.  BIDEN NOMINEE COORDINATED DARK MONEY CLIMATE NUISANCE LAWSUITS INVOLVING LEONARDO DICAPRIO She noted in the emails that NHTSA is ""in charge of climate standards for cars,"" that she was among the first ""NHTSA appointees ever with serious climate expertise,"" and that her appointment proved the Biden administration would be ""really serious about their climate goals."" ""I view my appointment (and a number of others) as evidence that the Biden Administration is truly committed to a 'whole of government' approach to addressing climate change,"" Carlson wrote in a Jan. 21 email reviewed by Fox News Digital. At the time, the Biden-Harris transition team hired Carlson, who was an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, to serve as NHTSA's chief counsel, the emails showed. While the position didn't require Senate confirmation, Carlson has overseen key agency initiatives like the modification of fuel economy standards and has served as acting administrator since September. The Western Energy Alliance-led coalition wrote that NHTSA's administrator should be ""focused on saving lives and mitigating harm, not reorienting the agency to engage in a whole-of-government approach to climate change."" BIDEN'S EPA HAS COORDINATED WITH LEFT-WING ECO GROUPS TIED TO LIBERAL DARK MONEY NETWORK ""She's on a mission to ban the internal combustion engine,"" Western Energy Alliance President Kathleen Sgamma told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""It's pretty clear she wants to use NHTSA's regulatory powers to do something that Congress didn't give her the power to do. And that is to force drivers into electric vehicles."" ""She's just not appropriate for the job,"" Sgamma continued. ""She has a climate change agenda and she has conflicts of interest. She's just not at all concerned with highway safety. She is concerned with getting Americans out of the vehicles that they want to drive and forcing them into EVs."" The letter Wednesday was addressed to Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Ranking Member Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The committee is tasked with overseeing her nomination.  But Cruz led a letter signed by every Republican committee member to Carlson on Monday, expressing their concern about the Biden administration's aggressive EV push. The letter was first reported by The Hill. President Biden nominated Carlson, an environmental law expert, for NHTSA administrator in February.

"Joint venture building ??nderwater space station??to study marine life, climate change","A joint venture is underway between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Proteus Ocean Group to build an ""underwater space station of the ocean"" to study marine life and climate change.  With plans to be built and located off the Caribbean island of Curacao, NOAA says the station ""PROTEUS,"" will be the first underwater site of this stature.  The station will serve as an underwater habitat where scientists and researchers can live underwater to study the ocean environment for extended periods of time.  PROTEUS will include state-of-the-art scientific laboratories, living quarters, an underwater garden for food production, and a full-scale video production facility to provide live-streaming for research and educational programming.  ETA AQUARID 2023 METEOR SHOWER: HOW AND WHEN TO WATCH ""This partnership has the potential to greatly expand our capabilities in studying the ocean,"" Jeremy Weirich, the director of NOAA Ocean Exploration, said in a statement. ""By living underwater for extended periods in this new ocean laboratory, well be able to unlock the oceans mysteries so that we can better manage, sustainably use, protect, and appreciate its resources.""  Fabien Cousteau, founder of Chief Oceanic Explorer of Proteus Ocean Group and grandson of famed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, said PROTEUS will give the team ""unbridled access to the ocean 24/7."" Proteus will make ""possible long-term studies with continuous human observation,"" Cousteau said. ""With NOAAs collaboration, the discoveries we can make  in relation to climate refugia, super corals, life-saving drugs, micro environmental data tied to climate events and many others  will be truly groundbreaking.""   Through their partnership, NOAA will provide access to scientists, vessels and technology, while Proteus Ocean Group will share data and insights related to the development of the underwater habitat.",04/05/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/science/joint-venture-building-underwater-space-station-study-marine-life-climate-change
"WATCH: Kennedy stumps Biden official on $50 trillion cost to fight climate change: 'You don't know, do you?'","Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., left one Biden administration official without words Wednesday when he pressed him to answer one simple question: How much would spending $50 trillion in American taxpayer money to become carbon-neutral lower global temperatures? ""If we spend $50 trillion to become carbon-neutral by 2050 in the United States of America, how much is that going to reduce world temperatures?"" Kennedy asked Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk during a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing. Turk appeared unable to provide a specific number, and instead began arguing that the U.S. needed to do everything it could to reduce carbon emissions before being interrupted by Kennedy pressing for an answer to the question. SCHUMER ROASTED FOR SAYING NOBODY IS TAKING AWAY YOUR GAS STOVE JUST MONTHS BEFORE NY BANNED GAS STOVES ""How much, if we do our part, is it going to reduce world temperatures?"" Kennedy asked again. ""So, we're 13% of global emissions right now,"" Turk responded, before Kennedy jumped in again, saying, ""You don't know, do you? You don't know, do you?"" ""You don't know, do you, Mr. Secretary?"" Kennedy asked as Turk appeared to continue dancing around the question. ""If you know, why won't you tell me?"" ""If we went to zero, that would be 13% "" Turk said. ""You don't know, do you? You just want us to spend $50 trillion, and you don't have the slightest idea whether it's going to reduce world temperatures,"" Kennedy said.  BIDEN NOMINEE PUSHING ELECTRIC VEHICLES FACES MASSIVE OPPOSITION FROM ENERGY INDUSTRY ""Now, I'm all for carbon neutrality, but you're the deputy secretary of the Department of Energy, and you're advocating we spend trillions of dollars to seek carbon neutrality, and you can't  and this isn't your money or my money, it's taxpayer money  and you can't tell me how much it's going to lower world temperatures? Or you won't tell me? You know, but you won't?"" he continued. Turk responded that in his ""heart of hearts"" the rest of the world wouldn't act on climate change unless the U.S. led on the issue, but did not provide an answer to Kennedy's question. ""Tell me how much it's going to reduce  you can't tell me. Either that, or you won't,"" Kennedy said before moving on.  Some climate experts have claimed it will cost $50 trillion for the U.S. to reach carbon neutrality, which would include investing in so-called green energy and other things like electric vehicles. Critics have, however, argued that there is no guarantee spending that amount would have any effect on climate change across the globe if other countries don't take similar action.

Gas stoves 'cooking' the planet claims climate reporter in response to New York's 'bold' ban,"A CNN reporter touted New York's ban on natural gas was backed up by science, in a Wednesday report. Governor Kathy Hochul and the Democratic state legislature approved a budget this week making New York the first state in the nation to ban natural gas and fossil fuels in new buildings. CNN's chief climate correspondent Bill Weir argued it was indisputable that gas stoves were contributing to climate change. ""There is no doubt, the science is showing us that those choices [gas stoves] are heating up the planet at sort of a scary rate. All put together, buildings account for about 20% of carbon planet-cooking carbon pollution as well,"" Weir reported. GAS STOVE BAN ON THE TABLE FOR FEDERAL AGENCY: REPORTS The CNN report called New York's ban ""a bold move to address the climate crisis.""  Weir noted that while it was the first state to take such an action, there were about 90 towns, cities and counties across the country which had already banned natural gas. Although a court struck down a ban in Berkeley, California, he suggested there was ""other routes"" for Democrats to get bans enacted. ""This is part of a wave of electrification across the country. New York the first state, but there's about 90 municipalities and counties, the first was Berkeley, California, a couple years ago. But interestingly enough, a couple weeks ago, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down their ban on gas hookups to new buildings there. But theres other routes to it. Different building codes, energy codes that could make it easier for others who want to do this,"" Weir said. Only electric heating and cooking in new buildings shorter than seven stories will be required by 2026 under the new rule. Taller building must meet the regulation by 2029.  TWITTER BLASTS NEWS BIDEN ADMIN MIGHT BAN GAS STOVES: PRY FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS  Weir acknowledged that the ban was drawing backlash as gas cooking and heating was an ""emotional and cultural"" thing to many people. ""Its a very emotional thing, cooking over fire. Its primal. People love the idea of a furnace burning in the basement to keep them warm or they like the way their food cooks. Its a cultural thing,"" he said. The Biden administration drew intense backlash last January when a consumer product safety official suggested a federal ban on gas stoves for health and safety reasons was ""on the table.""   The White House was forced to clarify that President Biden does not support a ban on gas stoves following public outcry. At the time, media outlets slammed outrage over the proposal, claiming conservatives were waging a ""culture war"" over a non-issue. However just a few weeks later, the Department of Energy announced new efficiency standards on gas and electric stoves. Around half of all models currently on the market would not comply with the proposed standards without modifications, a Department of Energy spokesperson told FOX Business. ""As required by Congress, the Department of Energy is proposing efficiency standards for gas and electric cooktops  we are not proposing bans on either,"" a department spokesperson said. ""The proposed standards would not go into effect until 2027 and cumulatively save the nation up to $1.7 billion. Every major manufacturer has products that meet or exceed the requirements proposed today."" Energy and consumer advocacy groups blasted the new DOE regulations last month, arguing the rules were ""arbitrary and capricious"" while having minimal impact on climate change.  The groups suggested the regulations did not comply with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) which mandates the federal government implement energy efficiency measures while not harming consumer choice.  ""The agencys exaggerated claims of climate change benefits do not alter the fact that proposed rule violates the consumer protections in the statute,"" they wrote to the DOE ""For these reasons, we believe the proposed rule should be withdrawn.""

"Young Democrats feel 'nervous,' 'anxious' and 'depressed': Gone from a 'yes we can country to a no you can't'","More young Democrats are feeling nervous and hopeless, according to a Harvard Kennedy School of Politics poll.  The mid-March poll, which covers 18-to-29-year-olds, found 61% feel nervous and anxious, 57% have trouble relaxing and 52% feel depressed and hopeless.  Several of ""The Five"" co-hosts argued this week that Democratic messaging on issues like climate change, could be playing a role in young peoples fears about the future.  The show highlighted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's comments in 2019 about how the world will end in 12 years unless climate change is addressed.  CLIMATE GROUPS, YOUNG VOTERS ANGRY OVER BIDEN'S SUPPORT FOR FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY: HE SOLD US OUT ""Yes, all of us have nerves and anxiety because that's how you live. That's called survival. And you learn how to deal with that. It's called resiliency,"" Dana Perino said.  She added that the country has evolved from a ""yes we can country to a no, you can't and it's not your fault [country].""  ""I do think there is an ideological difference,"" she said. ""So conservatives for a long time They should take Ronald Reagan, right? He was morning in America, waking up on the sunny side of the mountain and so happy. The Democrats and liberals have been more along the lines of mourning in America. Doom and gloom, everything's bad and bad sells and bad gets you donations."" Co-host Judge Jeanine Pirro said she thinks a coddling culture is part of the problem.  ""I mean, that's part of the problem. They're being coddled. They're being taken care of by their families. They're being told that you need a safe space. And, you know, feelings and words can trigger all kinds of emotions. That's training. That's behavior that moves from one generation to the next. I mean, it's learned behavior. And so we've got this whole group of young people who don't know what it's like to have to survive on their own,"" she argued.  LEFT RIPPED FOR PUSHING NIGHTMARISH CLIMATE NARRATIVE ON CHILDREN: 'APOCALYPTIC POISONING' ""Sure, there are legitimate reasons to be fearful and anxious. I mean, you know, you walk down the street here, you might suffer a carjacking. You might be shot by someone in a gang who doesn't know how to shoot because they never want to a range. They just picked up a gun. I mean, there are some legitimate reasons to be depressed, but these kids aren't being taught how to pull themselves out of it, how to survive on their own, how to be tough. And that's why a lot of the conservative young people, they say it's a different breed of kid.""  Co-host Jessica Tarlov argued that social media is playing a role in fueling young peoples anxiety at an early age.  ""Eighteen-to-29-year-olds share a lot of common fears. A lot of them have to do with school shootings and growing up in a generation that was doing lockdown drills, teen anxiety due to our obsessive emphasis on student achievement, is a big piece of this as well. And that's bipartisan,"" she explained.    ""People on both sides have the opposing view of how the other one is ruining the country, and that gives them anxiety if they're that politicized at this point. But I worry that this is actually deeper than politics, and that's more disconcerting than any of this.""",06/05/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-democrats-feel-nervous-anxious-depressed-gone-yes-we-can-country-no-you-cant
Wind energy developer funneled cash to Dem senator pushing offshore wind,"A multibillion-dollar energy developer has wired tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine's campaign in recent years while aggressively pushing a massive offshore wind project.  The Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion Energy's political action committee (PAC) has funneled $23,000 to Kaine for Virginia since 2011, with the latest, a $1,500 contribution, coming in February. In that same time span, Dominion Energy has given another $44,500 to Common Ground PAC, the leadership PAC affiliated with and chaired by Kaine. Since 2021, Dominion Energy executives led by CEO Robert Blue and Senior Vice President William Murray have donated $19,600 to Kaine's campaign. At the same time, lobbyists who Dominion has contracted made payments totaling $3,000 to the campaign. ""Dominion Energy believes in full transparency of its political donations,"" Dominion Energy spokesperson Ryan Frazier told Fox News Digital in an email. ""We give to a bipartisan mix of leaders at the state and federal levels and have supported Sen. Kaine since his bid for lieutenant governor in 2001, after he was mayor of the city Dominion Energy calls home."" BIDEN ADMIN IS RUSHING TO INDUSTRIALIZE US OCEANS TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE: 'ENVIRONMENTAL WRECKING BALL' Meanwhile, Dominion Energy continues to trudge forward with plans to develop Virginia's first offshore wind farm. The project, known as Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) and located off the state's southeastern coast near Virginia Beach, consists of two operational pilot wind turbines and is on track to be fully constructed by 2026 with 176-205 turbines across 112,800 acres. Kaine has been a vocal supporter of the project, which would be the largest offshore wind development nationwide, urging federal regulators to fast-track its permitting process and successfully winning millions of dollars in funding for supporting projects. TOP OFFICIALS WARNED BIDEN ADMIN ABOUT DANGERS WIND ENERGY PROJECTS POSE TO FISHING INDUSTRY, LETTER SHOWS ""We are proud that the first two wind turbines permitted and constructed in federal waters are off our Commonwealths coast, producing clean energy for Virginians,"" Kaine and other Virginia lawmakers wrote in a March 2021 letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), demanding quicker approval of CVOW. ""Unfortunately, we have heard from local stakeholders and constituents that the adjacent CVOW project is at risk of delays due to the backlog at BOEM,"" the letter continued. ""Please provide any additional information that will help us fully understand the challenges BOEM faces and how you plan to expedite the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project."" Less than four months after the letter was sent, BOEM published its notice of intent, initiating the agency's environmental review of the process. ""I'm thrilled to see this project underway as it's an exciting step toward a clean energy economy that creates good jobs in the commonwealth,"" Kaine said in a statement included in a July 2021 Dominion Energy press release. ""I will keep pushing for clean energy investments in Virginia to boost our economy and build a more sustainable future.""  BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY PLANS POSE NATIONAL SECURITY RISK, PENTAGON WARNS Then, in December 2021, Kaine announced he and fellow Democratic Virginia Sen. Mark Warner had secured $20 million in federal funding for improvements to the Portsmouth Marine Terminal, allowing it to serve as a staging area supporting CVOW construction and development. He said the grant would ""go a long way towards establishing Virginia as a hub for offshore wind development."" In the latest development for the project, BOEM published a draft environmental impact statement for the project that backed the company's proposal, paving the way for a final approval. A spokesperson for Kaine, though, said campaign contributions had no bearing on his decision making or the projects he supports. ""Senator Kaine makes decisions based on his own research and conscience, as informed by his intense listening to Virginians,"" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""Since 2011, Senator Kaine has raised well over $40 million from well over 100,000 donors. Donations have no effect on his decisions."" Additionally, in recent months, offshore wind development has faced increased pushback over its potential negative impacts on marine wildlife like endangered whales, commercial fisheries, shipping vessels and maritime communications. The Pentagon also warned that offshore wind projects could impede naval operations.  ""Offshore wind enjoys bipartisan support in Virginia and federally,"" said Frazier, Dominion Energy's spokesperson. ""Offshore wind legislation in Virginia passed overwhelmingly. The project has been designed to address potential impacts to shipping lanes, commercial fishing activity, marine life and more. ""The company has engaged the U.S. military and commercial fishermen since development of the project began,"" he added. ""And the federal permitting process considers all environmental impacts. The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will create jobs in and economic opportunities and clean energy for the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is a win for everyone.""",06/05/2023,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wind-energy-developer-funneled-cash-dem-senator-pushing-offshore-wind.amp
